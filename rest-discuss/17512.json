My \nthesis is based on a mapping framework transforming XML Web =\r\nServices (both SOAP \nand POX) to RESTful HTTP format. This framework has tw=\r\no stages: a) a \nconfiguration stage that sets up a mapping file and b) a ru=\r\nn-time adapter that \ntransforms the messages based on the mapping file. \n\n =\r\n   The advantages are that this framework enables the Web architecture (POS=\r\nT \ncan be replaced with GET in certain situations); the framework helps wit=\r\nh \ngradual migration from SOAP/POX to RESTful HTTP WS. It has constraints o=\r\nf \ncourse, principally: URI limits for GET/DELETE and SOAP/POX POSTs which =\r\nmap \nlogically to multiple RESTful URI&#39;s are left untouched (i.e. as a POST=\r\n).\n    Where the Semantic Web comes into it is in the mapping file that inf=\r\norms the \nrun-time adapter. The first version had a manual setup where the =\r\nuser matched \nthe XML WS operations to RESTful HTTP verbs. The second/curre=\r\nnt version uses the \nSemantic Web to automate this process. Currently, I us=\r\ne SAWSDL for the XML WS \nside and hRESTS/MicroWSMO on the RESTful WS side. =\r\nA tool called Core Dashboard \nenables me to annotate both services [1]. Bot=\r\nh sides point to the &quot;conceptually&quot; \nhigher semantic ontology layer (WSMO-L=\r\nite is the standard I use for this layer). \n\n    In my thesis I will have t=\r\no cover the alternatives and originally SA-REST \nappeared to be that. Howev=\r\ner, the W3C submission is different to earlier \npublications. My informatio=\r\nn is that it is a microformat (hRESTS/MicroWSMO) \nversus RDFa (RDFa/SA-REST=\r\n) option. So if that is the case is my logic below \ncorrect:\n\n\t1. It would =\r\nappear that SA-REST is equivalent to (hRESTS + MicroWSMO). It has a \nservic=\r\ne model similar to hRESTS and using the SA-REST properties (domain-rel, \nse=\r\nm-rel and sem-class) can point to the semantic layer (as MicroWSMO does).\n\t=\r\n2. Then using RDFa, SA-REST has the ability to be serialised from XHTML as =\r\n \nRDF.\nThanks again,\nSean.\n\nPS A lifting is an XSLT transformation that map=\r\ns e.g. a SOAP message to the \n&quot;conceptually higher&quot; semantic layer (an RDF =\r\nfile); a lowering is the opposite. \n\n\n[1] Core Dashboard, http://coconut.ti=\r\ne.nl:8080/dashboard/#1304670463179\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\nFro=\r\nm: Eric J.

Since I don&#39;t se=\r\ne the point of an IDL when using the\nhypertext constraint, I don&#39;t see the =\r\npoint of IDL-as-microformat,\neither.  I&#39;ve also never seen the point of a m=\r\nachine-readable service\ndocument as an endpoint user-agents need to consult=\r\n before taking\naction -- what results is some other architectural style (wh=\r\nere the\nsemantics of the URI mappings vary based on some hash table at an\n&quot;=\r\nentry point&quot; URI, instead of remaining RESTfully static).\n\nSo I can&#39;t answe=\r\nr your questions, since I don&#39;t know how this &quot;fits in&quot;\nwith REST, either. =\r\n What hRESTS/SA-REST look like to me, is kludged-in\ntooling support to more=\r\n efficiently produce the HTTP APIs most folks\n*call* REST APIs these days. =\r\n Remember, I don&#39;t judge APIs by whether\nthey&#39;re RESTful, only how well the=\r\ny&#39;re suited to their purposes, so I&#39;m\nnot scorning any project which may re=\r\nsult in better APIs -- my *opinion*\nis that this approach may even lead som=\r\ne people _to_ REST&#39;s hypertext\nconstraint, so it&#39;s probably a good thing, j=\r\nust mis-labeled.\n\nWe&#39;ve also discussed machine-readability many times; ther=\r\ne are those\nwho prefer machine-targeted data types, and those who prefer RD=\r\nFa.  I\nsee RDFa as a superior solution to microformats, for any purpose, an=\r\nd\nhRESTS is another example of why -- instead of a general-purpose parsing\n=\r\nmodel, each microformat has its own unique parsing model, usually\ndefined a=\r\ns XSLT -- as is the case with hRESTS/SA-REST, which GRDDL-maps\nits microfor=\r\nmat to RDF, begging the question &quot;why not just use RDFa?&quot;\n\nInteroperability=\r\n is a concern; modular XHTML encompasses Xforms, which\ngives the ability to=\r\n &quot;describe&quot; more HTTP-method-rich APIs, but those\ntokens collide with hREST=\r\nS -- which really shouldn&#39;t use class=3D&#39;label&#39;\nbecause that collides with =\r\n&lt;label&gt;, as well.  The reason it&#39;s easier to\ncreate RDF vocabularies than i=\r\nt is to create markup languages (or even\nmicroformats), is the vocabulary a=\r\nuthor doesn&#39;t have to worry about if\nbrowsers&#39; javascript forms-modules res=\r\nerve &#39;label&#39; as a keyword, etc.\n\nIn a nutshell, I don&#39;t see how using hREST=\r\nS/SA-REST would result in the\nRESTful APIs I&#39;ve done using Xforms/RDFa; alt=\r\nhough by solving what I\nwho doesn&#39;t use tooling for API development conside=\r\nrs a non-problem, I\ncan see how I could&#39;ve produced functionally-equivalent=\r\n HTTP APIs in a\nfraction of the time.  Which seems to be the problem with a=\r\nny effort to\nmass-produce RESTful APIs, what&#39;s lost in translation is all t=\r\nhe design-\nfor-longevity goodness which distinguishes REST APIs from HTTP A=\r\nPIs.\n\nThe hRESTS/SA-REST approach intrigues me from an HTTP tinkerer\nperspe=\r\nctive, supporting server-parsed server-configuration-on-the-fly.\nOn one han=\r\nd, this would philosophically violate separation of concerns;\nOTOH, long-te=\r\nrm maintenance of Web systems based on static files may\nbenefit from having=\r\n fewer files to edit.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. Where does SA-REST fit in? The service model =\r\n[1] looks very\n&gt; similar to the service model of hRESTS [2]. According to t=\r\nhe diagram\n&gt; at the start of  [2], SA-REST sits on top of hRESTS - why then=\r\n does\n&gt; SA-REST  define a similar service model? \n&gt; \n\nPerhaps you should as=\r\nk this of the authors, since they&#39;re the same?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. According to [2], SA=\r\n-REST supports faceted search. Where are\n&gt; &quot;p-lang-binding&quot; and &quot;data-forma=\r\nt&quot; [2] coming from? Why is there no\n&gt; mention of them in the W3C Submission=\r\n ? [3].\n&gt;\n\nThat is a good question, and if it&#39;s machine readable, then wher=\r\ne are\nthose tokens like PHP and Java defined and how is versioning accounte=\r\nd\nfor?  I understand the problem of mashing up services which use\ndifferent=\r\n formats, but I don&#39;t understand the rationale of solving this\nby making se=\r\nrvices searchable by data format (or any other &quot;facet&quot;),\nlet alone what it =\r\nhas to do with REST other than attaching that name to\nnew IBM products whic=\r\nh support this feature.  Seems like tight coupling\nto me, hence my confusio=\r\nn on calling it REST...\n\nParticularly when their example of a RESTful Web S=\r\nervice is a JSON-RPC\nendpoint.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 3. In its service model [1], there is n=\r\no  lifting/lowering. How is\n&gt; this done when using SA-REST?\n&gt;\n\nWhat *are* l=\r\nifting and lowering?\n\n-Eric\n\r\n--0-2076356980-1304679700=:28438\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/he=\r\nad&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman,new york,times,serif;fon=\r\nt-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hi Eric,&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for the time =\r\nyou took on that detailed response - appreciate it.

[3]=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is a good question, and if it&#39;s machine readable, the=\r\nn where are&lt;br&gt;those tokens like PHP and Java defined and how is versioning=\r\n accounted&lt;br&gt;for?&nbsp; I understand the problem of mashing up services wh=\r\nich use&lt;br&gt;different formats, but I don&#39;t understand the rationale\n of solv=\r\ning this&lt;br&gt;by making services searchable by data format (or any other &quot;fac=\r\net&quot;),&lt;br&gt;let alone what it has to do with REST other than attaching that na=\r\nme to&lt;br&gt;new IBM products which support this feature.&nbsp; Seems like tigh=\r\nt coupling&lt;br&gt;to me, hence my confusion on calling it REST...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Partic=\r\nularly when their example of a RESTful Web Service is a JSON-RPC&lt;br&gt;endpoin=\r\nt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; 3. In its service model [1], there is no&nbsp; lifti=\r\nng/lowering. How is&lt;br&gt;&gt; this done when using SA-REST?&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wh=\r\nat *are* lifting and lowering?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Eric&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/=\r\nhtml&gt;\r\n--0-2076356980-1304679700=:28438--\r\n\n"}}
