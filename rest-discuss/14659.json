That&#39;s up to you. It might\n&gt; be useful in scenarios where the entry XML ends up on disk (when you loose\n&gt; the request URI) then the self tells you where the entry XML came from.\n\nok.......\n\n&gt; In my experience, it is often a waste of time to try to be very dynamic/general/automatic. Just ask the underlying DAO for the data and pupulate the Atom entry object &#39;by hand&#39;. That&#39;s fine.\n\nthe problem here is: to maintain a large amount of code just to do\nthis copies .. it seems fine in a small example, but for hundreds of\nentities that eventually  will be modified in the future is a mess to\nhave copy and transformations between the DAo and the HTTP layer......\nI created a small framework to traverse the data without extra\nprocessing....\n\n\n&gt; Hmm - are you sure populating another XML element is significant in a networked environment ...\n\nnot significant in terms of processing, but for sure in terms of\nsoftware maintenance...\n\n\n&gt; Do not understand. Can you explain?\n\n\nI have an entity with a collection field. and I have a sub-entity that\ninherits the collection from its parent. I can eventually have a\nsecond collection in the subclass, overwriting the parent one, just\nfor changing the names.. but I am now see it will add more problems\nthan solutions..\n\nthanks for the tips..........\n\n* after the presentation at Jfokus I will publish the slides and also\nsome blogs to show what I have here.. for now I am still focusing in a\ngood presentation at Stockholm...\n\nany of you at Jfokus, Sweden this week, please tell me and we can\nshare a beer or two over REST topic :)\n\n"}}
