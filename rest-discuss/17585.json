But I\ndigress -- this is about architecture, not lousy customer service:\n\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2003393/How-Citigroup-hackers-broke-door-using-banks-website.html\n\n&quot;Law enforcement officials said the expertise behind the attack was a\n&#39;sign of what is likely to be a wave of more and more sophisticated\nbreaches&#39; by high-tech thieves.&quot;\n\nOh, dear... we really are in trouble if law enforcement&#39;s that clueless.\nThere was *no* expertise involved here.  I&#39;ve seen the account # in the\nURLs hundreds of times, I just always _assumed_ I was only logged in to\nmy account not everyone&#39;s.  Having that bad an architecture is just\ncriminal.\n\nThe lulzers?  Not so much.  I bet the black-hats who&#39;ve been mining\nthat hole for years, are plenty upset with them.  Personally, I feel\nlike an idiot for not bringing all my own http skills to bear on the\nWeb interfaces for any account involving my money, instead of foolishly\ntrusting the likes of Citigroup to be at least script-kiddie-proof.\n\nSince we&#39;re already dealing with https, what are the arguments against\nhttp auth again, aside from how it looks/works in browsers?  The\nproblem here wasn&#39;t the CC #&#39;s in the URLs -- hash and salt them for\nthe DB, sure, but don&#39;t expose that to a world that already knows how\nto format CC #&#39;s; then you have an encapsulation layer instead of SQL-\ninjection-via-URL.\n\nSo I never saw the URI allocation scheme as a problem, and I still\ndon&#39;t even though it was the vector of attack responsible for my own\ndata being distributed freely on the Internet.  The problem is bad\narchitecture, which is all too common on roll-your-own cookie-based\nauthentication schemes.\n\nWhich is an argument in favor of not being able to style the good ol&#39;\nbutt-ugly browser login boxes.  At least when I&#39;m dealing with those, I\nknow at a glance that any security holes the site has are probably just\nmisconfigurations which may be fixed by anyone knowledgeable of http --\nas opposed to systemic flaws buried in custom algorithms, which will\ntake &quot;years to fix,&quot; in the words of the runner-up to this ITAS, Sony...\n\n-Eric (wearing disgruntled-Citi-customer hat)\n\n"}}
