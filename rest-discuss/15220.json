I think you make several\nvery good p=\r\noints. It&#39;s true that, after ten years, there is still not\nmuch accessible =\r\nmaterial on this very important architectural style.\n\nOne of the problems I=\r\n see is that some very good scholarship on\narchitectural styles is bottled =\r\nup behind IEEE and ACM pay walls. This\nmakes it more difficult to build a l=\r\narge collection of information\nfrom which others can easily draw.\n\nMy own f=\r\neeling is that, at this point in time, collecting as many of\nthe varied and=\r\n disparate links, references, and examples as possible\nand offering them in=\r\n a targeted search would go a long way to exposing\na general theme and comm=\r\non ground that has developed around Roy&#39;s\ninitial work over the years.  Tha=\r\nt includes making rest-discuss and\nother email archives (HTTP, etc.) search=\r\nable.\n\nI also think that many people active on this list are type to keep\nt=\r\nhemselves quite busy. I see very few folks here volunteering to take\nup new=\r\n tasks. That&#39;s a bummer since so many on this list have been\nhere quite a w=\r\nhile and have so much to offer the general community and\nprobably would off=\r\ner their time if we could come up with ways to make\nit easy to contribute r=\r\negularly.\n\nI, too, admit I&#39;m pretty tied up. But I&#39;m ready to offer assista=\r\nnce\nwhere possible.\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\n\n\n\n\nOn Sat, Apr 10, 2010=\r\n at 08:59, Ivan =C5=BDu=C5=BEak &lt;izuzak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hey all,\n&gt;\n&gt; A =\r\nfew days ago I wrote a blog post on why I think understanding REST\n&gt; is har=\r\nd and what we can and *should* do about it -\n&gt; http://wp.me/poYaf-34. Since=\r\n a lot of what I wrote was inspired by\n&gt; following this group and since thi=\r\ns group is the most relevant (only?)\n&gt; place for discussing REST - I&#39;d like=\r\n to know what you think. Short\n&gt; version (since the post is really long):\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Although there&#39;s a lot of great blog posts, papers and mailing list\n&gt; di=\r\nscussions, the current material on REST is a mess which makes REST\n&gt; hard t=\r\no understand and confusing to discuss:\n&gt; * there is no agreed upon and wide=\r\nly used terminology, but a lot of\n&gt; unexplained and overlapping terms,\n&gt; * =\r\ndiscussions are fragmented all over the web and often unnecessarily\n&gt; repea=\r\nt previous discussions,\n&gt; * there are no (formal or semi-formal) models of =\r\n(important) concepts.\n&gt;\n&gt; Therefore, I think people involved in and enthusi=\r\nastic about REST\n&gt; (mostly people on this group) should:\n&gt; 1. Agree that th=\r\nere is a problem worth fixing =E2=80=93 do we think that we\n&gt; can create a =\r\nbetter, clearer and more systematized way of\n&gt; understanding and discussing=\r\n about REST?\n&gt; 2. Express interest in fixing it =E2=80=93 is this something=\r\n people want to\n&gt; contribute their time to?\n&gt; 3. Agree on how to fix it =E2=\r\n=80=93 what should be our output (a RESTopedia, a\n&gt; document, video tutoria=\r\nls) and how would we all contribute to and\n&gt; moderate the process?\n&gt; 4. Do =\r\nit =E2=80=93 spend time discussing and developing the output.\n&gt; 5. Eat our =\r\ndogfood =E2=80=93 use whatever we produce. If we don=E2=80=99t use the\n&gt; te=\r\nrminology and models we agree upon, the the mess has only gotten\n&gt; bigger.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Ivan (hoping that all of this doesn&#39;t sound as babbling of an=\r\n\n&gt; overeagerly naive megalomaniac)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ----------------------------------=\r\n--\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
