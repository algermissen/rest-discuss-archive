Bow=\r\nman&quot; &lt;eric@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I wrote (as it turns out) a REST applicat=\r\nion in 1995 that&#39;s long-since\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; disappeared, but serves to make a poin=\r\nt. A pizza parlor wanted its\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; customers to be able to order pizza for=\r\n pickup or delivery, from their\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; website. The order page allowed size=\r\n, style and toppings to be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; selected. The confirmation page re-stated=\r\n the order, adding a total.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Cancelling the order returned the custom=\r\ner to the blank order form;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; placing the order went as follows:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The customer saw a &#39;thank you&#39; page informing them they would rece=\r\nive\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; an &#39;order confirmed&#39; e-mail, and a phone call shortly before the=\r\n order\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; was ready in the case of a pickup. This page linked back to t=\r\nhe menu.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The server, upon receiving a POST of the data in hidden inp=\r\nut fields\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; from the confirmation page, executed a Perl script to conv=\r\nert the name/\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; value pairs into a human-readable order.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n This order text was then e-mailed to the pizza parlor, where it would\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; be printed out. The incoming mailbox would only receive from the Perl\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; script, so it would only receive orders, so the printout was automatic=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; as was the autoresponder confirming to the customer that the order=\r\n was\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; received by the kitchen, not just the website (by using the cus=\r\ntomer&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; e-mail as reply-to). The frontend customer application was R=\r\nEST. The\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; backend m2m process was NOT REST.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Why should =\r\nit have been? The need was for reliable messaging that HTTP\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t =\r\nhave (if I&#39;d been concerned about message order, then I&#39;d have\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; used =\r\nmultipart), and a one-to-one connection rather than HTTP&#39;s one-to-\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; m=\r\nany. So the correct choice of protocol, then and now, was and is SMTP\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; which is not a RESTful protocol. REST is not the solution to all\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; p=\r\nroblems in Web services development.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Could another protocol, =\r\nperhaps HTTP, be used to make this m2m process\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; RESTful? Sure! But it=\r\n would be convoluted, so what&#39;s the point? I&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; never advocated REST=\r\n for the sake of being RESTful, or bending over\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; backwards to solve a=\r\n problem with REST that&#39;s better and more easily\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; solved otherwise. F=\r\nor the pizza problem, REST is only relevant to the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; customer interact=\r\nion. Applying REST elsewhere may be possible, but if\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the purpose and=\r\n benefit of REST is simplicity, such a complex REST\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; solution misses =\r\nthe point of the style completely.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I believe there&#39;s a proble=\r\nm out there, where systems have been designed\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; for SOA and are now co=\r\nnverting to ROA as if it&#39;s merely a different\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;serialization,&quot; if yo=\r\nu will. So we see efforts to apply REST to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; problems that REST isn&#39;t =\r\nmeant to solve, instead of re-architecting\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; systems in terms of probl=\r\nems REST can solve, while recognizing that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; parts of the system are b=\r\netter off being NOT REST.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; As I&#39;ve said before, saying REST/NO=\r\nT REST is not a value judgement. In\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; fact, sometimes, for something t=\r\no be RESTful can be a mistake.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; -Eric\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
