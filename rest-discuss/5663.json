Indeed those methods are common to bot=\r\nh \nComponent and Connector interfaces. However, following the REST \ndissert=\r\nation, a component is not a kind of connector: \nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~fie=\r\nlding/pubs/dissertation/software_arch.htm#sec_1_2_1\n\nWhat do you think abou=\r\nt adding a new LifeCycle interface that would be \nimplemented by both Compo=\r\nnent and Connector?\n\nThanks,\nJerome\n\nPS: As you asked, let&#39;s continue this =\r\ndiscussion in the more specific\nRestlet discussion list: http://www.restlet=\r\n.org/discuss\n\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Peter Marks &lt;peter.c.ma=\r\nrks@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve been studying the Restlet classes and int=\r\nerfaces. You guys have\ndone a\n&gt; great job!\n&gt; \n&gt; I have one question: The me=\r\nthods that define a Connector are those\nthat stop\n&gt; and start and check the=\r\n state of a connector (isStarted() and\nisStopped()).\n&gt; I see that these sam=\r\ne four methods have been added to the Component\n&gt; interface. Have you consi=\r\ndered refactoring so that a Component is a\n&gt; Connector? And the Component i=\r\nnterface would continue to add the\nability to\n&gt; have clients, servers and c=\r\nall clients.\n&gt; \n&gt; Perhaps I&#39;m missing something obvious or you are too far =\r\nalong to do a\n&gt; refactoring.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just curious...\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n=\r\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
