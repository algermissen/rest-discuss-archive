Essentially the intention of the language  \nwas to simplify reacting to changes in the scraped UI.\n\nHere is a code fragment:\n\n;---- scrape XYZ screen ----\n     LABEL SCREEN_ABC\n\n     FIND &quot;ADDRESS&quot;\n     EXTRACT &quot;Street&quot;\n     POSITION 653\n     EXTRACT &quot;City&quot;\n     EXTRACT &quot;State&quot;\n     EXTRACT &quot;ZIP&quot;\n\n     FIND &quot;INACT DT&quot;\n     EXTRACT &quot;InactiveDate&quot;\n     NEXT\n     EXTRACT &quot;Inactive&quot;\n\nI find it interesting, that this looks a lot like what one would  \nwrite to resemble the browsing and drilling-down patterns of REST&#39;s  \napplication model. Imagine an RDF enabled user agent - &#39;FIND  \n&quot;ADDRESS&quot;&#39; (properly redone for RDF of course) could well mean: go do  \na GET, traverse the hypermdia links until you find something that can  \nbe inferred to be an address and &quot;EXTRACT CITY&quot; would then give us  \nthe foo:city of that address.\n\nMaking use of this programatically would remove the need for a  \ndocument-type based coupling (e.g. this GET has to respond with an  \naddress) between client and server and instead emphasize traversal of  \nhyperlinks until some stated information need is satisfied.\n\nBack in 94...how smart!\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n[1] http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/ramblings/ \n42_eaidsl.html\n\n"}}
