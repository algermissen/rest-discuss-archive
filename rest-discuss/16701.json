If\n&gt;&gt; it is defined such it is not related to the expected data structures,\n&gt;&gt; hyperlink mechanisms and available relations, than it is indeed\n&gt;&gt; orthogonal to a schema. That&#39;s fine with me, sorry for any confusion.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; What I mean is, you can&#39;t recommend doing this:\n&gt;\n&gt; Content-Type: application/json;\n&gt; profile=http://json.com/my-hyper-schema\n&gt;\n&gt; Because when I look at the IANA registry, I see that application/json\n&gt; maps to RFC 4627, which only lists one optional parameter, charset. I\n&gt; see no definition of any profile parameter. The usage you are\n&gt; recommending is not self-descriptive, because it is not supported by RFC\n&gt; 4627.\n&gt;\n&gt; One possible processing model for XHTML documents is text/plain, another\n&gt; is text/html, and another is application/xhtml+xml -- please see RFC\n&gt; 3236 as an example of how a media type registration is the proper place\n&gt; to define such usage. RFC 3236 doesn&#39;t extend the definition of profile\n&gt; to text/html, text/plain, or even application/xml -- this would be out-\n&gt; of-scope.\n&gt;\n&gt; If a standard comes along which registers application/foo+json, it is\n&gt; up to that MIME registration to define the usage of a profile parameter.\n&gt; Such a definition shouldn&#39;t have to worry about conflicting with some\n&gt; other use of that syntax being forced on it by an unrelated spec, in\n&gt; particular a schema spec which may have nothing whatever to do with the\n&gt; schema (or BNF notation) being used to describe application/foo+json.\n\nYes, that makes sense, I&#39;ll update the text for the next draft to try\nto have more appropriate language.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; This usage is part of the processing model defined by the media type\n&gt; identifier, it is not appropriate for a schema language to define such\n&gt; usage for anything beyond, in this case, application/schema+json --\n&gt; your media type registration for that identifier doesn&#39;t make sense, as\n&gt; it doesn&#39;t define &#39;schema&#39; or &#39;schema.items&#39; and omits any mention of\n&gt; the &#39;profile&#39; parameter (again, see RFC 3236).\n&gt;\n&gt; Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m in favor of +json, I&#39;m just giving the same\n&gt; feedback that both schema+json and senml+json have gotten -- the right\n&gt; way to do this is to first change RFC 4288, then RFC 4627:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ietf-types/current/msg01062.html\n&gt;\n&gt; Otherwise, I don&#39;t see approval of either I-D until that issue is\n&gt; settled or their associated identifier syntax is changed. But then\n&gt; again, maybe it will be anyway, I don&#39;t know -- all I do know is that\n&gt; no +json identifier has yet made it into the IANA registry, therefore no\n&gt; +json identifier is currently self-descriptive; and that it is not self-\n&gt; descriptive to use a profile parameter in conjunction with any media\n&gt; type identifier unless that identifier defines a profile parameter.\n\n- From that thread, it sounded like everyone was in favor of making the\nupdates. I wonder if that is being done by someone...\n\n- -- \nKris Zyp\nSitePen\n(503) 806-1841\nhttp://sitepen.com\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.9 (MingW32)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org/\n \niEYEARECAAYFAkydcYIACgkQ9VpNnHc4zAyDEACfSl9koe9GiSIG4Vj4bIFF9qip\nSqcAn02wFDwZw7pljiIb+8pdIeVgFevm\n=BJaB\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n\n"}}
