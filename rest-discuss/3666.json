My point is that if we put in a \nlittle work we can specify the same services on top of HTTP/SMTP and reuse \nmore of our installed based of software while simultaneously avoiding the \ncomplexity of SOAP.\n\nThe implementation details of transaction managers/monitors, ease of \ndevelopment, long/dropped transactions, and prioritization are really \nimplementation or application issues not protocol issues.  If someone has a \nreliable client, they don&#39;t need a separate HTTP transaction manager \nserver.  Control of sub-transactions can be as easy as editing a list of \ncurrent commits/rollbacks, but that is really an IDE question and not a \nprotocol one.\nThere are millions of shopping carts abandoned everyday across the \nInternet.  How you handle this issue depends on your site. etc.\n\nI am suggesting the HTTP/SMTP equivalent of ODBC.  That MS Access exposes \nODBC but does not implement two-phase-commit may be a problem with MS \nAccess, but it is not a problem with ODBC.  Similarly, that you may want a \nseparate transaction manager for ACID-HTTP is not an objection to \nACID-HTTP, it is just one of your particular implementation issues.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
