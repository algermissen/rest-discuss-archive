If the Request-URI refers to an already\n   existing resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a\n   modified version of the one residing on the origin server. If the\n   Request-URI does not point to an existing resource, and that URI is\n   capable of being defined as a new resource by the requesting user\n   agent, the origin server can create the resource with that URI. If a\n   new resource is created, the origin server MUST inform the user agent\n   via the 201 (Created) response. If an existing resource is modified,\n   either the 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) response codes SHOULD be sent\n   to indicate successful completion of the request. If the resource\n   could not be created or modified with the Request-URI, an appropriate\n   error response SHOULD be given that reflects the nature of the\n   problem. \n\n\n"}}
