All safe operations are also idempotent, but not all\n&gt; idempotent operations are safe (PUT, DELETE).\n\nI thought PUT was idempotent for one UA only. Two UAs introduce a race \ncondition on PUT order, unless clients agree to synchronize, or servers \nforce them to (as is the case with subversion/dav).\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n\n"}}
