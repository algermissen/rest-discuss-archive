It *can* be useful to make representations more \nself-contained (when representations invoked to render said \nrepresentation, such as images embedded in an HTML document are \nreferenced by such URIs).\n\nIn the cases where REST is of use the opaqueness of HTTP URIs (or at \nleast, the fact that the URI is opaque to at least some agents that may \nbe dealing with them) are a positive quality not a negative.\n\nI do not see the value of hybriding HTTP and DATA URIs.\n\n"}}
