I\n&gt; mean, DELETE, PUT, OPTIONS, HEAD, or whatever?\nYes, the HTML FORM element is essentially a &#39;service description language&#39;.\nIt supports instructing the client how to formulate a request - including\nspecifying the method.\nUnfortunately, the legacy browser client applications only handle a few\nmethods and have not defined a plug-in approach for handling other methods.\nIn addition, the FORM element is very limited in what parts of a request it\ncan control - for example, it would be nice to able to indicate that some\ninput is meant to be authentication information, or that submitting the form\nshould clear the client&#39;s authentication information for the specified host,\netc. The WHAT-WG is working on some improvements in how browsers handle HTTP\nand what capabilities are exposed to web application designers.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The annoying thing is that there&#39;s no way to post a form without using a\n&gt; button or image? Or JavaScript, I mean something like &lt;a\n&gt; href=&quot;javascript:document.forms[0].submit();&quot;&gt; isn&#39;t any good.\nDoing a POST implies the user is legally responsible for the resulting\naction - and no end user wants to be legally responsible for &#39;silently&#39;\nsubmitted forms.\nAgain, this is a factor of the client application. Some browsers might\nsupport a POST request based on some other user action than pushing a\nbutton - but I don&#39;t know of any. Other client applications - like a media\nplayer - might do a POST based on drag-drop of a file into a window... the\npossibilities are endless & dependent on the user-agent (the client app).\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
