This architecture emphasizes generality of\ninterfaces (UIs and APIs) to achieve global network effects through\nfive fundamental generic interface constraints:\n1. Identification of resources\n2. Manipulation of resources through representations\n3. Self-descriptive messages\n4. Hypermedia as the engine of application state\n5. Application neutrality\n\nI am especially interested in this list&#39;s feedback on the addition of\na fifth constraint to Roy&#39;s four &quot;uniform interface&quot; constraints:\n&quot;application neutrality&quot;. Reactions to the change from &quot;uniform\ninterface&quot; to &quot;generic interface&quot; are also welcome. (As are any other\nreactions -- except to the choice of the name &quot;WOA&quot;. &lt;grin&gt;)\n\n-- Nick\n\nNick Gall\nPhone: +1.781.608.5871\nAOL IM: Nicholas Gall\nYahoo IM: nick_gall_1117\nMSN IM: (same as email)\nGoogle Talk: (same as email)\nEmail: nick.gall AT-SIGN gmail DOT com\nWeblog: http://ironick.typepad.com/ironick/\nFurl: http://www.furl.net/members/ngall\n\n"}}
