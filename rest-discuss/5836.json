Fielding wrote:\n&gt;  &gt; OTOH, a translation service like\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;    /convert?format=pdf\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; can simply be a POST of file-upload with the response being the\n&gt;  &gt; converted representation.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; However, that doesn&#39;t seem very RESTful.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Why?  POST is RESTful too, when it is used correctly.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is what confuses me.  My (naive) understanding is that every URI \n&gt; represents a noun, that is, a resource.  The URL:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://myhost.com/convert\n&gt; \n&gt; seems like it represents a verb, especially when given parameters:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://myhost.com/convert?format=pdf\n&gt; \n&gt; or even when given other nouns:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://myhost.com/convert?format=pdf&uri=http//example.com/ \n&gt; &lt;http://myhost.com/convert?format=pdf&uri=http//example.com/&gt;\n&gt; get_it_here.html\n&gt; \n&gt; So, if I read Roy correctly, the service described by that URL is -- \n&gt; or at least could be -- RESTful. Does this mean that the belief &quot;URLs \n&gt; must represent nouns&quot; is a complete myth?  Or is there something else \n&gt; going on here?\n\n\n/mydocument.html/pdf\n\nAlternative if the service is on the same domain. All */pdf patterns map \n  back to the code that renders out the pdf and take the rest of the \npath. It&#39;s kinda idiomatic for some frameworks to centralise the service \nunder one url and take other urls as arguments not because of any design \nconsiderations or separation of concerns but because the URL dispatching \nis optimised for certain patterns that end up looking servicey.\n\nLet&#39;s not mix up my name with what I do.\n\nIt&#39;s more than verb tunneling. One can then argue that putting conneg \ncrap in the URL is no better than putting verbal crap in there.\n\nre services. If your service runs on it&#39;s domain and in spirit accepts \nurls as arguments, then it&#39;s probably really a &quot;service&quot; (in the sense \nthat a translation house is a service). Technorati is an example of \nservice that fits the seperations of concerns idea (except it gives you \nbacklinks instead of PDFs).\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n\n\n\n"}}
