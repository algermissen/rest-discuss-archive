If so, would you call SOAP (the envelope format)\n&gt;&gt; application neutral?\n&gt;\n&gt; The note discusses all 3 facets of an interface: Identifiers, Formats\n&gt; (representations), and Protocol operations (IFaPs as we call them). All\n&gt; three facets should be as &quot;application neutral&quot; or generic as possible.\n&gt; Everyone focuses on generic protocol operations (HTTP&#39;s GPPD), but\n&gt; generalizing identifiers and formats is equally important.\n&gt; SOAP is indeed application neutral. Perhaps even more application neutral\n&gt; than HTTP itself, since SOAP is little more than a framework for an XML\n&gt; envelope with completely open ended XML header processing. It is extremely\n&gt; application neutral. The problem is, interface designers take the incredibly\n&gt; generic SOAP format and put an incredibly application specific XML payload\n&gt; inside it. That&#39;s like stepping of a neutrality cliff -- from extremely\n&gt; generic to extremely specific in one step.\n&gt; Of course the same can happen (and does happen) with Atom entities or even\n&gt; with representations returned by HTTP itself. But it seems to us that\n&gt; interface designers in the REST &quot;camp&quot; seem to better understand the\n&gt; importance of reusing existing representations for new applications, not\n&gt; custom designing representations for each new application. An example of\n&gt; this is the RESTafarian insistence that HTTP is NOT a transport protocol,\n&gt; but rather an &quot;application protocol&quot;, albeit a VERY application neutral one.\n&gt; What we haven&#39;t seen yet, even from the REST &quot;camp&quot; is much in the way of\n&gt; fairly generic ATOM entities to go inside the ATOM &quot;envelope&quot;. Many REST\n&gt; examples using ATOM step off the same cliff.\n&gt; One last point about SOAP. In the note, we make the distinction between\n&gt; &quot;application neutrality&quot; and &quot;implementation neutrality&quot;. WS-* (and SOAP in\n&gt; particular) seems overly focused on &quot;implementation neutrality&quot;, ie making\n&gt; sure the SOAP envelope and SOAP headers can be bound to virtually any\n&gt; underlying middleware (incl. security middleware) technology. In general,\n&gt; this emphasis on &quot;implementation neutrality&quot; distracts WS-* interface\n&gt; designers from the far more important issue of &quot;application neutrality&quot;. In\n&gt; fact, SOAP is positioned as simply part of a WS-* &quot;application protocol\n&gt; toolkit&quot; to enable developers to design custom application protocols. (I\n&gt; have an excerpt from the note about this in my blog post that I gave earlier\n&gt; in the thread.)\n&gt; -- Nick\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
