It suits my purpose=\r\n to define SOA as something that&#39;s high-level enough (or vague enough, if y=\r\nou prefer);\n\nThat is totally fair!. My idea of setting it is to be clear up=\r\nfront what the named concept means for each of us. Now I know yours and you=\r\n know mine. :D\n\nActually, I agree completely with your point of view about =\r\nwhat people want and how should they get it. What I dislike a little bit is=\r\n the naming confusion.\n\nI came up with a great idea. Let&#39;s create a new sty=\r\nle called Ice Cream Oriented Architecture (ICOA). It has restrictions A and=\r\n B, that will give you benefits X and Y. Someone reads about benefits, igno=\r\nres the restrictions, and starts doing a flawed ICOA. Even worse: there is =\r\nno Ice Cream, only nuts. \n\nAfter some years, someone else discovers the NOA=\r\n (I&#39;ll let you figure out the acronym), that using nuts alone can get benef=\r\nits W, X and Y. All is fine, you try to sell NOA and nobody buys it. Then y=\r\nou rename NOA as the next generation of ICOA (ICOA-NG), that uses the revol=\r\nutionary nutty flavored HARD ice cream, that does not melt and has no milk =\r\n(And it doesn&#39;t even need cooling anymore), and voila!  Everybody loves it.=\r\n Branding that is. And nobody, ever, enjoyed an Ice Cream in the process.  =\r\n \n\nSo we agree in the core, not sure if we agree that the names can get to =\r\nconfusion, and may cause trouble thereafter.\n\nWilliam.\n\n--- In rest-discuss=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, Stefan Tilkov &lt;stefan.tilkov@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi William,\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Frankly, I&#39;m not interested in discussing what SOA is or is not, as th=\r\nere&#39;s nobody who can decide who&#39;s right. It suits my purpose to define SOA =\r\nas something that&#39;s high-level enough (or vague enough, if you prefer); the=\r\n reason is that I see many people who want something from SOA (easy interop=\r\nerability, loose coupling, wide support in different platforms, =85) that t=\r\nhey can achieve more easily with RESTful HTTP than with SOAP/WSDL/WS-*. I c=\r\nan give them REST and they can still have their SOA cake.\n&gt; \n&gt; Related to t=\r\nhat, I define &quot;service&quot; more as a mini-application than as an individual in=\r\nterface. When implemented using RESTful HTTP, it becomes a set of related r=\r\nesources (more commonly called a Web app) instead of a Web service (a set o=\r\nf WSDL-described individual SOAP interfaces).\n&gt; \n&gt; If you define SOA differ=\r\nently, this logic is flawed. Which is OK.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best,\n&gt; Stefan\n&gt; \n&gt; On Apr 6=\r\n, 2010, at 2:58 PM, William Martinez Pomares wrote:\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
