Say, I want to clear my shopping cart, so I delete it.\n&gt;&gt; However, when =\r\nI GET it later on, it simply says that it&#39;s empty\n&gt;&gt; rather than it doesn&#39;t=\r\n exist.\n&gt;\n&gt; No. Don=92t overload the meaning of verbs to use them for\n&gt; =93=\r\nsomething similar=94. DELETE has narrow semamtics; if your use\n&gt; does not p=\r\nreserve them, then you should not be using DELETE.\n\nHe&#39;s not overloading th=\r\ne meaning; DELETE requests the resource&#39;s\nrepresentations be removed, and t=\r\nhe server does that so is able to\nrespond 2xx to it.  Nothing says the serv=\r\ner can&#39;t then immediately -\nor at any time of its choosing - make new repre=\r\nsentations of that\nresource available.\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
