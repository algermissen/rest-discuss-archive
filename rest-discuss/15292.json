This appears to be due to the\n&gt; thinking of either &quot;yes, we do REST&quot; (when in fact its tunnelled HTTP\n&gt; e.g. POX) or SOAP is in situ and with the click of a button, one is\n&gt; abstracted from the verbose complex XML that is going on underneath...\n\nWhile I definitely want to see what my company does involve more\n&quot;RESTful&quot; efforts, I think the above has two mis-characterizations:\n\n1) Our developers are aware that they are not doing &quot;REST&quot; - they know\nthey&#39;re using SOAP, or JMX to issue remote requests.  I think the\nconfusion will start when developers build an app using Ruby-On-Rails,\nor JAX-RS, and think they&#39;ve made it REST-ful.  If they don&#39;t bother to\nthink about the details of the media-types they&#39;re creating, or whether\nthey&#39;ve coupled the clients to specific URIs, then it isn&#39;t RESTful. \nSure it is closer, which is great, but it still isn&#39;t there.\n\n2) the statement &quot;complex XML that is going on underneath&quot; makes no\nsense to me.\n\nIf I have to define my own media type as I anticipate the applications I\nwill work on will need to do - then I have to spend just as much time\ndefining that media type as I would for a schema definition to be used\nwith SOAP messages.  If my application needs end-to-end encryption,\nwhether I&#39;m doing SOAP or REST, I may still need to use XML Security,\nwith all of its complexity.\n\nSo the alleged complexity strikes me as being about the problem being\nsolved, not about the choice of framework.  Plain old SOAP over HTTPS\n(without WS-Addressing, WS-RM, WS-Policy), is pretty darn\nstraightforward, and secure.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; RESTful systems are easier to integrate with (Uniform Interface),\n\nIf a development team doesn&#39;t have the time to figure out how to do a\nwell-defined WSDL interface (known verbs, known data), why would you\nthink that getting the &quot;REST&quot; approach right is any more likely?  Sure\nthe interface is well known, but you have to think a lot more about\nother problems (media-type definitions, steady state, unanticipated uses).\n\nIf you do have a useful interface, the tooling around SOAP is much\nbetter than it used to be, so yes it may be easier to integrate RESTful\nsystems with a browser, but not all clients are browsers, and it may be\njust as easy to integrate a SOAP-based system with a SOAP-client.\n\n&gt; more flexible/easier to extend (well known MIME types)\n\nExcept that if I cannot use those well known MIME types, or I have to\ncreate a profile for them, then it is just shifting work from one place\nto another.  Reuse is always a good idea, so it seems like &quot;well known\nMIME types) is just an argument based on reuse.  That&#39;s fine, but it is\nworth recognizing it for what it is, and that re-use isn&#39;t always possible.\n\n&gt; and have lower maintenance/upgrade costs (server decoupled from client).\n\nDecoupling software is a very hard problem.  With a RESTful approach,\nyou still need to test and work with old clients.  With SOAP, I need to\ntest and work with old clients - if all I do is extend the WSDL in the\nSOAP world, why is that any more difficult?\n\nAlso, there are other ways to decouple - such as middle-tier messaging\nsystems - JMS, AMQP, Jabber.\n\nMaybe I&#39;m mis-casting this, but I could theoretically build a RESTful\n(non-human) clients by &quot;screen-scraping&quot; HTML, which of course required\nfrequent intervention by a human to update the client to reflect the new\nstate of the server.  Until the servers offer up the data in a\npredictable way (custom media-type, for example), the servers haven&#39;t\ndelivered on the promise of lower maintenance/upgrade costs.\n\n\n&gt; . RESTful HTTPs distributed advantages are unquestioned (e.g. caching).\n\nWell, except when they are questioned.  If the key portion of my\napplication is processing data that is constantly changing, then what\nadvantage do I possibly get from caching?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The question appears to be: how to sell REST within the enterprise?\n\nThat framing strikes me as part of the problem.  I don&#39;t need to &quot;sell&quot;\ndevelopers on using REST - I need to get them to understand it, when it\nmakes sense to use, and when it makes sense to do something else, such\nas one of those alternate messaging systems.\n\nThe people that need to be &quot;sold&quot; on REST are the IT purchasing\nmanagers, and their frame is typically straightforward - how much does\nit cost, and how well does it satisfy my requirements?  REST is almost\ncompletely orthogonal to that discussion, because they don&#39;t typically\ncare about serendipity to create new applications that they didn&#39;t\nanticipate.  That&#39;s a hidden opportunity to which they cannot assign\nvalue.  This is sort of the inverse of the discussion about security\n(hidden costs that are difficult to assign value).\n\nTo that end, the &quot;almost REST&quot; approaches are actually much more useful\nto this discussion - if I can get a developer to use something like\nRuby-On-Rails, or JAX-WS, or to notice that their application is\nentirely a &quot;CRUD&quot; application that can fit into three or four verbs\n(GET, PUT, POST, DELETE), then they can start down the path to using\n&quot;full&quot; REST.  I typically don&#39;t actually care if they ever get all the\nway to a REST architecture, because within the enterprise, the systems\nsimply aren&#39;t &quot;internet scale&quot;, there aren&#39;t millions of clients - maybe\na few hundred, or at most a few thousand, and the things that make REST\na requirement on the web are simply not requirements within the enterprise.\n\n&gt; I would be surprised if the reduced longterm costs highlighted above\n&gt; are not of interest... Are the perceived costs of a migration from\n&gt; SOAP/POX to RESTful HTTP resulting in a lack of adoption?\n\nWell, going back to the notion of decoupling clients and servers - I\ncan&#39;t simply &quot;migrate&quot; - I have to continue supporting old clients.  So\nREST becomes an additional interface, rather than the alternate\ninterface.  Typically it will take years to phase out the old APIs, and\nin the meantime, you&#39;ve only added costs, added complexity, and split\nthe client base, instead of unifying it.  Eventually it will all be\nbetter, but in the meantime, it isn&#39;t simple.\n\nI&#39;m throwing out such an extensive reply because I think this is a\nreally interesting and important problem.  Yet if you tackle REST as an\nidea that just needs to be &quot;sold&quot;, then your chances of success are\nlow.  REST is useful, but from what I see, it is easy to underestimate\nthe utility of the other approaches already in use.\n\nIn the enterprise, REST is not the only valid and useful architectural\nstyle.  Rather it is but one of many, so people need to know more about\nit, know when to prefer it over some other style, know when the clear\ntechnical benefits apply, and have a clear picture of how to migrate\nfrom where they are to where they might be.\n\nHope that helps.\n\n-Eric.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Sean.\n&gt;\n&gt; PS Thanks for the replies..\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; *From:* Eric Johnson &lt;eric@...&gt;\n&gt; *To:* Sean Kennedy &lt;seandkennedy@...&gt;\n&gt; *Cc:* Rest Discussion Group &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; *Sent:* Wed, 14 April, 2010 19:15:36\n&gt; *Subject:* Re: [rest-discuss] migration toward REST in the enterprise\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt; As someone who works at creating software that enterprises run, I&#39;d\n&gt; say there isn&#39;t that much of a shift.\n&gt;\n&gt; Many of my colleagues recognize the value of REST, but it generally is\n&gt; an aspirational endpoint rather than an actual endpoint.  There might\n&gt; be a shift to recognize the aspiration, but certainly not the full\n&gt; execution.\n&gt;\n&gt; As an example of one difficulties, we&#39;re typically having machines\n&gt; communicate with machines.  Yes, in theory we could invest the time to\n&gt; define a media type that embodies all the semantics we need to\n&gt; capture.  In practice, that is more work up front than if we follow\n&gt; the &quot;web services&quot; path, define a WSDL interface, and generate the\n&gt; code we need.  Especially when we know it is almost a certainty that\n&gt; the client and server in these cases will change together, the extra\n&gt; work of figuring out a fully REST approach is actually unnecessary,\n&gt; and consequently inappropriate.\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course, in aspiring to REST, we do use tools like JAX-RS, which of\n&gt; course don&#39;t magically transform our code to &quot;REST&quot;, but they do start\n&gt; us down the path of &quot;REST&quot;.  Whether we get there or not depends on\n&gt; the use-cases and requirements for the software.  Which I think is as\n&gt; it should be.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Eric.\n&gt;\n&gt; On 04/14/2010 03:27 AM, Sean Kennedy wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; Hi,\n&gt;&gt;    I am a PhD student and I am trying to find out the level of shift\n&gt;&gt; in the enterprise-space from SOAP/POX WS to RESTful WS.

RESTful HTTPs distributed advantages are unquestioned (e.g.\ncaching).&lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWell, except when they are questioned.  If the key portion of my\napplication is processing data that is constantly changing, then what\nadvantage do I possibly get from caching?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;mid:183562.62535.qm@...&quot;\n type=&quot;cite&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;div\n style=&quot;font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe question appears to be: how to sell REST within the enterprise?&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThat framing strikes me as part of the problem.  I don&#39;t need to &quot;sell&quot;\ndevelopers on using REST - I need to get them to understand it, when it\nmakes sense to use, and when it makes sense to do something else, such\nas one of those alternate messaging systems.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe people that need to be &quot;sold&quot; on REST are the IT purchasing\nmanagers, and their frame is typically straightforward - how much does\nit cost, and how well does it satisfy my requirements?  REST is almost\ncompletely orthogonal to that discussion, because they don&#39;t typically\ncare about serendipity to create new applications that they didn&#39;t\nanticipate.  That&#39;s a hidden opportunity to which they cannot assign\nvalue.  This is sort of the inverse of the discussion about security\n(hidden costs that are difficult to assign value).&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTo that end, the &quot;almost REST&quot; approaches are actually much more useful\nto this discussion - if I can get a developer to use something like\nRuby-On-Rails, or JAX-WS, or to notice that their application is\nentirely a &quot;CRUD&quot; application that can fit into three or four verbs\n(GET, PUT, POST, DELETE), then they can start down the path to using\n&quot;full&quot; REST.  I typically don&#39;t actually care if they ever get all the\nway to a REST architecture, because within the enterprise, the systems\nsimply aren&#39;t &quot;internet scale&quot;, there aren&#39;t millions of clients -\nmaybe a few hundred, or at most a few thousand, and the things that\nmake REST a requirement on the web are simply not requirements within\nthe enterprise.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;mid:183562.62535.qm@...&quot;\n type=&quot;cite&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;div\n style=&quot;font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt; I would be surprised if the reduced longterm costs highlighted\nabove are not of interest... Are the perceived costs of a migration\nfrom SOAP/POX to RESTful HTTP resulting in a lack of adoption?&lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWell, going back to the notion of decoupling clients and servers - I\ncan&#39;t simply &quot;migrate&quot; - I have to continue supporting old clients.  So\nREST becomes an additional interface, rather than the alternate\ninterface.  Typically it will take years to phase out the old APIs, and\nin the meantime, you&#39;ve only added costs, added complexity, and split\nthe client base, instead of unifying it.  Eventually it will all be\nbetter, but in the meantime, it isn&#39;t simple.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nI&#39;m throwing out such an extensive reply because I think this is a\nreally interesting and important problem.  Yet if you tackle REST as an\nidea that just needs to be &quot;sold&quot;, then your chances of success are\nlow.  REST is useful, but from what I see, it is easy to underestimate\nthe utility of the other approaches already in use.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIn the enterprise, REST is not the only valid and useful architectural\nstyle.  Rather it is but one of many, so people need to know more about\nit, know when to prefer it over some other style, know when the clear\ntechnical benefits apply, and have a clear picture of how to migrate\nfrom where they are to where they might be.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nHope that helps.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n-Eric.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;mid:183562.62535.qm@...&quot;\n type=&quot;cite&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;div\n style=&quot;font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif;

path, define a WSDL interface, and generate the code we\nneed.  Especially when we know it is almost a certainty that the client\nand server in these cases will change together, the extra work of\nfiguring out a fully REST approach is actually unnecessary, and\nconsequently inappropriate.&lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;br&gt;\nOf course, in aspiring to REST, we do use tools like JAX-RS, which of\ncourse don&#39;t magically transform our code to &quot;REST&quot;, but they do start\nus down the path of &quot;REST&quot;.  Whether we get there or not depends on the\nuse-cases and requirements for the software.  Which I think is as it\nshould be.&lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;br&gt;\n-Eric.&lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;br&gt;\nOn 04/14/2010 03:27 AM, Sean Kennedy wrote:\n  &lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;blockquote type=&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;div id=&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;div\n style=&quot;font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif;
