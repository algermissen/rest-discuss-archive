(first post btw)\n\nI&#39;ve been reading Steve Vinoskis articles, and have begun to think about \nhow to take my current systems and convert them from the RMI-ish \napproach to a RESTful one. One of the problems that needs to be dealt \nwith, I think, is how to access the data of multiple resources \nefficiently. With RMI I would just make a call that describes the graph \nof objects I want to access, and then return the dataset. With REST, it \nseems, it would be better to just let each object have a URI and access \nthat, but if I then want to access related objects that would mean that \nI would have to do subsequent calls to fetch them (i.e. no eagerloading \nis possible). The good side of this seems to be that the accesses are \neasily cacheable, whereas fetching a graph would not be since each call \nwould require a slightly different graph most likely.\n\nHow do you deal with this? Do you typically let clients access resources \nindividually (for cacheability), or is there a &quot;bulk fetch&quot; way to do it?\n\nthanks,\n   Rickard\n\nps. If this is answered on the list already, if anyone has a reference \nto the thread that would be appreciated.\n\n"}}
