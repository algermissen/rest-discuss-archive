This way I can search for companies with a URL like\nthis &quot;/companies?name=&lt;pattern&gt;&quot; or for products with URLs:\n&quot;/products?name=&lt;pattern&gt;&quot;.\n\nThen I thought, products actually belong to the companies producing\nthem. So I came up with this product-URL:\n&quot;/companies/&lt;comp-id&gt;/products/&lt;prod-id&gt;&quot;.\n\nBut here&#39;s my problem now: how should a search be designed which is to\nsearch among all products of all companies - a global product search\nthat is? &quot;/companies/&lt;comp-id&gt;/products?name=&lt;pattern&gt;&quot; doesn&#39;t work\nglobally - at least it shouldnt.\n\nAm I to expose something like &quot;/search?type=products&name=&lt;pattern&gt;&quot;\nor are there reasonable alternatives?\n\nOr am I better off with the first approach?\n\n\nHow would you design such an API?\n\nAny hints are highly appreciated! Thanks,\nStefan\n\n"}}
