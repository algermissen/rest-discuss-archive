I am seeki=\r\nng a RESTful alternative. I will act as the business analyst here, stating =\r\nthe problem in a language that makes sense to the business. Here&#39;s the prob=\r\nlem:\n\nMany of us have had to catch a taxi at the airport (or some similar s=\r\netting) where a lot of people are doing the same. Generally, we stand in li=\r\nne, the taxis arrive, waiting if necessary, and the party at the front of t=\r\nhe line gets in the taxi, works out an agreement with the cab driver, and g=\r\noes. Sometimes, the cab driver and passengers won&#39;t reach an agreement and =\r\nthe passengers will go back to the front of the line and the taxis take the=\r\n next passenger. Details follow:\n\nThere are four types of actors involved: =\r\nPassengers, an airport, the taxi companies, and taxis.\n\nHere&#39;s what we know=\r\n of the basic process:\n1) passengers and taxis arrive at the airport with r=\r\nandom inter-arrival times\n2) on arrival, passengers ask the airport for a t=\r\naxi\n3) on arrival, taxis ask the airport for a passenger.\n4) the airport ma=\r\nkes passenger/taxi pairing by an &quot;oldest first&quot; rule for both taxis and pas=\r\nsengers, among those unpaired\n5) unpaired taxis and passengers wait for the=\r\n airport to pair them\n6) after a taxi and passenger are paired, they try to=\r\n agree on terms of service\n7) Sometimes taxis and groups can&#39;t agree and th=\r\nen the passenger goes back in line. The taxi should be paired with the next=\r\n available passenger. \n8) the airport breaks a pairing when either party te=\r\nlls the airport negotiations failed, or if 1-2 minutes pass.\n9) failed pair=\r\nings will not be repaired\n10) the probability of negotiation failures is sm=\r\nall for all taxis and all passengers, and eventually every party finds a pa=\r\nir they can deal with\n11) the airport can and should make concurrent pairin=\r\ngs\n12) a taxi departs when it and its passenger reach agreement and it tell=\r\ns the airport of the agreement, whereupon the airport&#39;s duties are done\n13)=\r\n taxi companies like to watch the passenger line depth (excluding paired pa=\r\nssengers) to make dispatching decisions (the decision mechanism is out of s=\r\ncope)\n\n\nIn typical business fashion, these represent a &quot;best effort&quot; attemp=\r\nt to capture the &quot;current&quot; requirements and may be clarified or revised som=\r\newhat for arbitrary and capricious reasons, because management is full of e=\r\nvil bastards. Complaining about this, or imprecise language, or other &quot;IT m=\r\numbo jumbo&quot; will result in you being reassigned to work on the TPS reports.=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
