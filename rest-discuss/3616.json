Here are some others, \ndon&#39;t know yet if they are important or not - just trying to get my \nmind around capabilities + REST.\n\n* How do capabilities and hyperlinks go together?  Does a tension \narise between them?  E.g. wouldn&#39;t a capability container resource \nnecessarily give you capabilities for all of the contained resources? \nWhat about navigating networks (graphs) of hyperlinks?\n\n* Do capabilities and digital signatures (e.g. for non-repudiation) \ngo together?  I don&#39;t see why not.  If I understand correctly, access \nis not dependent on your identity (only that you possess the \ncapability URI).  But your identity is still significant in other \nways.\n\n* Has anybody used capabilities and access control lists based on \nidentity together?  Do you think that is a bad idea, or useful in \nsome situations?  Which situations?\n\n* Open-ended, sorry:  what are the disadvantages of capability URIs?\n\nThanks, interesting stuff,\nBob Haugen\n\n\n\n"}}
