It does not \nmatter\n:\n: Well, no. There doesn&#39;t need to be &quot;another&quot; resource at all. Just\n: because the representation varies on request parameters doesn&#39;t mean at\n: all that there must be another resource involved. It could be that way,\n: but it doesn&#39;t have to be that way.\n:\n\nRight.  Maybe a better way to say it is that the server is not obliged to\nidentify variant representations with URI, thereby making them directly\naddressable by the client.  In fact, from the POV of encapsulating the\noriginal resource, it is undesirable to identify representations that don&#39;t\nneed individual addressability.\n\n: &gt; to a user-agent, it matters to the definition of content negotiation. \nWhen\n: &gt; a resource is negotiated, it is not a box of apples containing a Red\n: &gt; Delicious apple and a Golden Delicious apple. It is a box of apples \nwhich\n: &gt; has been divided into one container (bin) for Red Delicious apples and\n: &gt; another container for Golden Delicious apples. To dereference an apple \none\n: &gt; is reaching into a box of apples, yes, but one is reaching into one bin \nor\n: &gt; the other, and those bins (boxes) should be identified with URIs in a \nREST\n: &gt; system simply because they&#39;re resources.\n:\n: So who says that a server should assign a URI to a resource even though\n: it doesn&#39;t plan to make it accessible under that URI?\n:\n\nI think Eric does plan to make it accessible, so the question may be\nmoot.\n\nIn any case, I think Eric is mis-applying the advice &quot;identify resources \nwith\nURI&quot; in this particular cart of fruit.  That advice is targeted at a design \nproblem\nat the other end of the spectrum: applications written with a single \n&quot;endpoint&quot;\nbehind which resources are not identified and are therefore not available\nelsewhere in the Web.\n\nThe reality check, Eric, is this: since everything you can conceptualize \nabout\nyour application is a resource by definition, and because that definition \nallows\ninfinite recursion via resource-representation relation, it is obviously not \nfeasible\nto stamp every possible resource with a URI.  Ergo: we must be reading\nthe advice in the wrong context.\n\nWalden\n\n\n"}}
