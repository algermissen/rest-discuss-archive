Clients _cannot_ assume that a PUT does a complete replacement;\n\nThat is not the same issue. The question is what the message from the\nclient means.\n\n1.) Must a server obey everything in a client message in order to return 2xx ?\n2.) Do omissions in a client PUT message unset those portions, or do\nthey mean only update the included elements.\n\nThe answer to #1 is: of course not.\nThe answer to #2 is: they mean &quot;unset&quot;. (simple formula: turn on\ngeneric PUTs in Apache and observe its behavior)\n\nNow, obviously,  Atom servers are going to ignore client instructions\nif they try wacky things like deleting atom:id. But that is because of\npoint #1. Nicks question concerns point #2.\n\n-- \n\nRobert Sayre\n\n&quot;I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.&quot;\n\n"}}
