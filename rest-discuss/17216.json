I&#39;ve read your blog post before, and it&#39;s the one\n&gt; that opened my min=\r\nd about the REST concept. It&#39;s so inspiring.\n&gt; In fact, I&#39;m surprise that y=\r\nou reply to my email.\n&gt; Your blog post is the one that=C2=A0makes me rememb=\r\ner about the UML behavioral\n&gt; state machine diagram.\n\nThanks, that&#39;s the ef=\r\nfect I was going for when I wrote the post.\n\n&gt; However, since you used &quot;fin=\r\nite-state machines&quot; and not explicitly said it\n&gt; as &quot;UML\n&gt; state machine di=\r\nagram&quot;, I&#39;m not confident enough to put it as a reference.\n\nAlthough there =\r\ndefinitely are differences between the two formal\nmodels (FSM and UML state=\r\n diagram), such as hierarchy, there is also a\nbig overlap and both are comm=\r\nonly used with the same goal - to\ndescribe the behavior of complex systems.=\r\n I&#39;m not sure which\nreferences you are talking about and where you&#39;d like t=\r\no put them, but\nI don&#39;t see the differences between models important enough=\r\n to not\nlist something since the object/purpose of modeling is the same, an=\r\nd\nthe models are similar.\n\n&gt; Yesterday, after trying to spend more time to =\r\nfind good academic reference,\n&gt; I found Nora Koch&#39;s thesis\n&gt; (=C2=A0http://=\r\nwww.pst.informatik.uni-muenchen.de/~kochn/PhDThesisNoraKoch.pdf )\n&gt; which c=\r\nlearly stated that possible state transitions can be depicted using\n&gt; UML s=\r\ntate diagram (page 16).\n&gt; Since it&#39;s written in year 2000, I concluded that=\r\n the UML version that is\n&gt; used in the thesis is UML 1.1 or 1.3.\n&gt; And sinc=\r\ne then, the UML state diagram has been developed into state machine\n&gt; diagr=\r\nam in UML 2.3,\n&gt; which include behavioral state machine diagram.\n&gt; And, bei=\r\nng confident enough to use that conclusion, I use Nora Koch&#39;s thesis\n&gt; as a=\r\n reference.\n\nNice, I haven&#39;t seen this thesis before, so thanks! As you&#39;ve =\r\nprobably\nnotices, there aren&#39;t many papers which explicitly model REST or R=\r\nEST\nconstraints, but you&#39;ll find that a lot more papers model various\naspec=\r\nts of hypermedia (including UML state diagrams). Howeverm, I&#39;m\nnot an exper=\r\nt in UML so I&#39;m not sure what the difference between UML\nstate diagrams and=\r\n UML state machine diagrams is so I can judge your\nfocus on the latter vs t=\r\nhe former.\n\nBest of luck with your research!\nIvan\n\n"}}
