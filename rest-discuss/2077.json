Beware that\n&gt; neither SOAP nor REST map well onto the event-based model. HTTP is\n&gt; fundamentally a &#39;pull&#39;-focused protocol while event-based models\n&gt; are &#39;push&#39;-focused. It can be done but it should not be done.\n\nHTTP PUT, POST, and DELETE are pushed. The Web Works Both Ways.\nI think SOAP-as-messaging would work fine for event-based systems, but I\nhaven&#39;t put much thought into it.\n\nThere are other reasons to be cautious of an event-based model with REST.\nIts very easy to slip into tunneling of methods if your resources become\ngeneric &#39;queue&#39; and &#39;topic&#39; resources. I know now that this can be\nproblematic when doing application resource modelling.\n\nHowever, if you are able to maintain a rich resource model and not drift\ninto generic messaging, events are fine way to build systems. One thing I\nlearned a while ago was to not worry about lots of small events - trying to\naggregate them into a single message isn&#39;t worth the effort.\n\nYou state that the problem with sending events separately is &quot;since then I\ncan&#39;t always know the two events are related.&quot;\nHow do you know the events are related anyway? Model that as a resource and\nyou may make some progress.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
