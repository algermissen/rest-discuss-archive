There\n&gt; are different extents to which a REST-based application will use HTTP\n&gt; methods, but that doesn&#39;t mean the architectural style has two different\n&gt; sets of constraints.  \n\nNo, you&#39;re right; I&#39;ve made the mistake of conflating REST with HTTP.\n\n\n&gt; The application is either obeying the REST\n&gt; constraints or it is not, and POST in particular has the meaning\n&gt; &quot;process this&quot; regardless of how REST-compliant it may be because\n&gt; REST does not define the meaning of POST (HTTP does).\n\nAs per HTTP, POST has two meanings ... &quot;submit data-block for\ndata-handling&quot; as well as &quot;resource {creation,annotation,extension}&quot;.\nThese represent very different designs; I still think it&#39;s critical to\ndistinguish the two.
