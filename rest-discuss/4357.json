I&#39;m attracted to the simplicity\nof the REST style and the lightweight requirements it\nplaces upon its clients but am not certain that I&#39;ve\nfully grasped how to apply it to our particular\nservice.  One of the recommendations I&#39;m having\ndifficulty visualizing is how I can eliminate client\nsession management.  In our application parameters for\na query may be dependent upon the results of a\nprevious query as in the case of generating routing\ninformation.  I&#39;m providing a brief description of\nwhat our system does and some of the constraints\nimposed upon it by our target platforms and would be\nvery interested on any comments, advice on how I might\ngo about re-implementing the system in a RESTful\nstyle. \n\nThe LBS solution is currently provided to mobile\nphones.  The system provides maps, routing and\ndirections in response to user GET and POST requests. \nMap images embedded in the resultant documents are\ncached on the server, other intermediate documents are\ngenerated but not cached. The current system is\nimplemented through a number of ASP scripts that\nprovide search, list, and detail pages for map\nlocations.  Maps are generated dynamically for\nco-ordinates or named locations by a 3rd party system\nco-located on the same server and exposing an XML\nRPC-style interface. \n\nIn prototyping the current non-REST system we\ndiscovered several limitations related to the phone\nhandsets: \n\n- Some handsets have a maximum URL length of 255\ncharacters.  Passing session state in the URL along\nwith co-ordinate pairs frequently took us above this\nlimit.\n- Cookie support cannot be guaranteed for the phone\nbrowser precluding the use of native session-tracking\nmechanisms on the server\n- Variations in WML rendering require document\ntransformation to phone-specific WML if optimal\npresentation is to be achieved\n\nThanks in advance,\nAdam Ratcliffe\n\n\nFind local movie times and trailers on Yahoo!
