I&#39;d like to have a formal notation\n| for the protocol operations I&#39;m working on. The Z Notation is pretty\n| good since it gives me functions, typed variables, and sets -- which\n| is not bad since RDF models are essentially sets and I think I can\n| treat protocol operations as functions.\n| \n| But I&#39;d really like something more specific to the problem domain. I\n| will be spelling out the formalisms in the specification in terms of\n| actual HTTP bits (headers, status codes, media types, etc.), but\n| something formal would be really helpful. (For one thing, I can do\n| formal manipulation of the sentences of a formal notation in a way I\n| can&#39;t do with strings like &quot;GET /model-uri HTTP/1.1&quot;.)\n| \n| Has anyone found anything that would work here?\n| \n| Thanks,\n| Kendall Clark\n| \n| \n| \n|  \n| Yahoo!
