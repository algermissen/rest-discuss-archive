Is that the right URI?\n\nAlso, if I understand you correctly, you&#39;re talking about transferring\nthe entire transaction state.  That sounds fine for something small\nlike a typical online shopping cart, but for a content repository that\nisn&#39;t going to scale. Think bulk loading. Potentially gigabytes of\ndata.\n\n&gt; PUT /someresource  { what you just GOT back }\n&gt; =&gt; 200\n&gt;\n&gt; and transaction ended.\n\nDitto. This will only work for me if it&#39;s by reference, not by value.\n\nThanks for the input!\n\n-- \n\nPaul Winkler\nhttp://www.slinkp.com\n\n"}}
