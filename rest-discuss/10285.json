I \n&gt; think the \n&gt; &gt; HTML5 WG came up with a brilliant solution for a similar \n&gt; problem, i.e. \n&gt; &gt; that of defining HTML5 as an abstract DOM and then defining \n&gt; different \n&gt; &gt; serializations for it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I tend to think that&#39;s 180 degrees backwards. I do not find \n&gt; object models to be interoperable, and I would prefer to \n&gt; define a concrete syntax completely separate from the \n&gt; definition of any particular object model. Syntax is \n&gt; interoperable and exchangeable. Object models are not.\n&gt; \n&gt; However if people haven&#39;t yet learned that lesson from the \n&gt; DOM, I don&#39;t know that they ever will.  Sometimes the \n&gt; community sounds like patients being treated by bleeding and \n&gt; getting sicker and sicker. Clearly the treatment isn&#39;t \n&gt; working so the patients demand and the doctor prescribes even \n&gt; more bleeding.\n\nWhen I said DOM I was being convenient, basically because I knew of the\nexample from HTML5.  Frankly, I don&#39;t have an opinion on legitimacy or\nillegitimacy of objects models and you didn&#39;t give me any reasons other than\nopinion to believe they are bad so I will stay on that fence for now.\nWithout clear and compelling examples of how an object model is bad, as you\nsay, I&#39;ll reserve my judgement.\n\nWhat I was really advocating was that we first determine an abstract model\nthat incorporates all things that are needed without the burden of having to\nin parallel render it to a syntax. Once we do we render in multiple syntaxes\nbecause rendering in only one syntax limits the appeal and usefullness to\nonly those for whom have experience with that syntax and to be use only in\nthe contexts where that syntax is easy to parse.\n\n&gt; DOM didn&#39;t fail because it was insufficiently specified. It \n&gt; failed because it was a fundamentally bad idea. \n&gt; Cross-platform, cross-language, cross-browser object models \n&gt; are the wrong solution to the problem. \n&gt; Expanding the spec from 20 pages to 200 won&#39;t fix the problem.\n\nIt&#39;s all well and good that you tell us what you see the problem to be, but\nsince you don&#39;t offer any examples or even solutions, your statements are\nimpossible to validate and don&#39;t offer any value, at least not to me.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org \n\n\n"}}
