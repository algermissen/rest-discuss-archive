The first point above is\nthat a RESTful API should primarily be concerned about data payloads\nand not defining how URI end points should handle various HTTP methods.\nFor one, sticking to defining data payloads which are then made\nstandard MIME types gives maximum reusability of the technology.  The\nspecifications for RSS 2.0 (application/xml+rss) and the Atom\nsyndication format (application/atom+xml) primarily focus on defining\nthe data format and how applications should process feeds independent\nof how they were retrieved.  In addition, both formats are aimed at\nbeing standard formats that can be utilized by any Web site as opposed\nto being tied to a particular vendor or Web site which has aided their\nadoption.  Unfortunately, few have learned from these lessons and we\nhave people building RESTful APIs with proprietary data formats that\naren&#39;t meant to be shared.  My current favorite example of this is\nsocial graph/contacts APIs which seem to be getting reinvented every\nsix months.  Google has the Contacts Data API, Yahoo! has their Address\nBook API, Microsoft has the Windows Live Contacts API, Facebook has\ntheir friends REST APIs and so on.  Each of these APIs claims to be\nRESTful in its own way yet they are helping to fragment the Web instead\nof helping to grow it.  There have been some moves to address this with\nthe OpenSocial influenced Portable Contacts API but it too shies away\nfrom standard MIME types and instead creates dependencies on URL\nstructures to dictate how the data payloads should be\nretrieved/processed.\n&quot;\n\nhttp://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2008/10/24/RESTAPIDesignInventMediaTypesNotProtocolsAndUnderstandTheImportanceOfHyperlinks.aspx\n\nThe REST style is derived from what made the Web successful in the\nfirst place.  That&#39;s why the emphasis is on standardized or\nstandardizable media types -- this makes the web grow, not fragment.\n+1 to Dare.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
