The best approach is to take a big step back and come\n&gt;&gt; at the problem from a slightly different angle (or utensil? ;-).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; A summary of my thoughts:\n&gt;&gt; - there is no &quot;right&quot;, generic way to use PUT to update a resource that\n&gt;&gt; works across all resources and media types except specifying verbatim\n&gt;&gt; how the resource should be represented in full. e.g. PUT the full .jpg\n&gt;&gt; image you expect to be served in a subsequent GET of the resource\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - if you are including enough data in a PUT to allow the the rest of the\n&gt;&gt; resource&#39;s state to be derived by the server then you are ok.\n&gt;&gt; Alternatively, you can have the server change the values the client\n&gt;&gt; suggests. This is my take on what AtomPub does. It is necessary for\n&gt;&gt; things like identifiers and URIs (in general hypermedia controls) that\n&gt;&gt; the server needs control over.\n&gt;&gt; ...\n&gt;\n&gt; Right. The important part is that the state of the resource after the\n&gt; PUT does only depend on the payload, not the previous state.\n&gt;\n\nWhy is that important?\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n"}}
