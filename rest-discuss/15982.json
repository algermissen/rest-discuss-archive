A pizza parlor wanted its\n&gt;&gt; &gt; customers to be able to order pizza for pickup or delivery, from their\n&gt;&gt; &gt; website. The order page allowed size, style and toppings to be\n&gt;&gt; &gt; selected. The confirmation page re-stated the order, adding a total.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Cancelling the order returned the customer to the blank order form;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; placing the order went as follows:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The customer saw a &#39;thank you&#39; page informing them they would receive\n&gt;&gt; &gt; an &#39;order confirmed&#39; e-mail, and a phone call shortly before the order\n&gt;&gt; &gt; was ready in the case of a pickup. This page linked back to the menu.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The server, upon receiving a POST of the data in hidden input fields\n&gt;&gt; &gt; from the confirmation page, executed a Perl script to convert the name/\n&gt;&gt; &gt; value pairs into a human-readable order.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; This order text was then e-mailed to the pizza parlor, where it would\n&gt;&gt; &gt; be printed out. The incoming mailbox would only receive from the Perl\n&gt;&gt; &gt; script, so it would only receive orders, so the printout was automatic,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; as was the autoresponder confirming to the customer that the order was\n&gt;&gt; &gt; received by the kitchen, not just the website (by using the customer&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; &gt; e-mail as reply-to). The frontend customer application was REST. The\n&gt;&gt; &gt; backend m2m process was NOT REST.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Why should it have been? The need was for reliable messaging that HTTP\n&gt;&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t have (if I&#39;d been concerned about message order, then I&#39;d have\n&gt;&gt; &gt; used multipart), and a one-to-one connection rather than HTTP&#39;s one-to-\n&gt;&gt; &gt; many. So the correct choice of protocol, then and now, was and is SMTP\n&gt;&gt; &gt; which is not a RESTful protocol. REST is not the solution to all\n&gt;&gt; &gt; problems in Web services development.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Could another protocol, perhaps HTTP, be used to make this m2m process\n&gt;&gt; &gt; RESTful? Sure! But it would be convoluted, so what&#39;s the point? I&#39;ve\n&gt;&gt; &gt; never advocated REST for the sake of being RESTful, or bending over\n&gt;&gt; &gt; backwards to solve a problem with REST that&#39;s better and more easily\n&gt;&gt; &gt; solved otherwise. For the pizza problem, REST is only relevant to the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; customer interaction. Applying REST elsewhere may be possible, but if\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the purpose and benefit of REST is simplicity, such a complex REST\n&gt;&gt; &gt; solution misses the point of the style completely.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I believe there&#39;s a problem out there, where systems have been designed\n&gt;&gt; &gt; for SOA and are now converting to ROA as if it&#39;s merely a different\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;serialization,&quot; if you will. So we see efforts to apply REST to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; problems that REST isn&#39;t meant to solve, instead of re-architecting\n&gt;&gt; &gt; systems in terms of problems REST can solve, while recognizing that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; parts of the system are better off being NOT REST.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; As I&#39;ve said before, saying REST/NOT REST is not a value judgement.
