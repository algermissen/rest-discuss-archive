I know that when I was new to HTTP, I wrote my Perl\n&gt; CGI scripts in the style that I outlined above as being what PHP\n&gt; leads people to, and I know that many many people new to HTTP\n&gt; write their first (or, indeed, every) PHP app that way.\n&gt; \n&gt; Novices don???t go meta as their first official act. They want to\n&gt; get something practical done, and they use whatever???s available\n&gt; and seems like it will advance them toward that end. If a URI\n&gt; dispatcher is not among those things, then they???ll build one only\n&gt; if they came to PHP from an environment that taught them why it\n&gt; is a good idea to have one. If this is their first HTTP app, they\n&gt; have no such instinct.\n&gt; \nActually, I realized after I sent my message that I hadn&#39;t read your\ndescription carefully enough.  You are correct, of course -- I DID\ncreate apps just like you described (verb in the URI) until recently.\nIt was the use of a front-controller that I moved to in the early stages\nof using PHP.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; A regex-to-code map style dispatcher is not difficult to write at\n&gt; all, but it???s also not very good in my opinion. I used to think\n&gt; it was as good as you???d want, like everyone else does, until I\n&gt; encountered Catalyst???s Chained dispatch type.\n&gt; \n&gt; (For thos who don???t know, basically that lets you break up a URI\n&gt; and dispatch the bits left to right to a series of intermediate\n&gt; controller methods, so you can split out the tasks that are\n&gt; common to several controller methods, going from the general to\n&gt; the specific. It lets you write extremely DRY code.)\n&gt; \nInteresting -- I&#39;ll need to take another look. My own dispatcher is\ndefined in an XML document, in the style of Cocoon.  It is &quot;compiled&quot;\nwith XSLT into a php hash (w/ regex as key) of config directives for that\nregex (including named captures, etc), so it&#39;s pretty flexible.  But you\nare correct in that a community built/documented solution would be\nwiser.\n\n&gt; Another interesting idea is Nevow Object Traversal, although it\n&gt; would need to be couched in sufficient syntactic sugar to make it\n&gt; as concise as it is flexible. However, if you want flexible and\n&gt; powerful, it???ll be rather hard to beat.\n\nI&#39;ll take a look -- sounds interesting.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; That???s kind of like saying one would like to see good practices\n&gt; encourages in Excel spreadsheet programming, rather than have it\n&gt; all written off. A laudable goal, but???\n&gt; \n\nWell...since I just discovered that I can ask clients to put their\nspreadsheets up on Google Docs and then &quot;consume&quot; the Atom feed with my\napplication, I am a happy camper.  But that&#39;s Excel as structured data,\n\tNOT as programming environment :-).\n\n&gt; Not that it matters too much either way, anway: it???s never all\n&gt; going to be written off, no matter what happens. (Which is in\n&gt; fact a much stronger incentive for wanting to encourage good\n&gt; practices.)\n&gt; \nIndeed.\n\nthanks-\nPeter Keane\n\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Aristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
