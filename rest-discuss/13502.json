Why would there be a mechanism to \nlimit understood formats if &quot;the server considers to formats equal&quot; and \n&quot;it doesn&#39;t matter at all&quot; ?\n\n\n&gt; &gt; How did you come to your understanding of the purpose of Accept?\n&gt; Common sense. Any other explanation is not logical.\n\nIf it was common sense why is it not in the spec?\n\n&gt; &gt; Why do you want to give two *representations* of one resource, two\n&gt; &gt; separate *resource* identifiers?\n&gt;\n&gt; Because my definition of resource is not anal. anything can be a \n&gt; resource, as a resource is a thing with a URI.\n\nRPC endpoints are &#39;resources&#39; ?\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; One answer to that might be that you need to link explicitly to them \n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; there&#39;s currently no way to indicate the necessary control data with\n&gt; &gt; (HTML) hyperlinks. That is true, and is the reason I brought this up.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If I want to link explicitly to two things, they&#39;re by definition \n&gt; distinct, and as such I will give them two URIs.\n\nSo you are implying that multiple representations of a resource should \nnot be distinct from one-another? That doesn&#39;t make sense.\n\nResources are distinguished by URIs, representations are distinguished \nby control data.  \n\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; What are the other reasons you have for violating the distinction\n&gt; &gt; between resource and representation?\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t violate anything.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I assume that you&#39;re overly focused on keeping the same URI for \n&gt; documents that are vastly different, and in doing so you see conneg as \n&gt; not being sufficient for what you&#39;re trying to achieve. I say that \n&gt; what you&#39;re trying to use conneg for is not what it was designed for.\n\nOK - Please could you explain your reasons for saying that\n\n- Mike\n\n"}}
