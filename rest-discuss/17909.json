Choose a URL structure that you\nthink will not change for a few years.\n\ne.g. Amazon&#39;s web page for &quot;Childrens&#39; Books&quot; might be structurally\n&quot;beneath&quot; the page for &quot;Books&quot;.  A hierachy if I ever saw one.  However the\nURLs don&#39;t reflect this.  Instead, the page for Books includes a link to the\n&quot;child&quot; pages, and the &quot;Childrens&#39; books&quot; page links back up to the &quot;Books&quot;\npage.\n\nLikewise in an API, you should expose links between your hierarchical\nresources indicating how to go &quot;up&quot; and/or &quot;down&quot; the hierarchy.\n\nThere&#39;s an internet-draft for expressing these relations inside atom links,\nalthough IMHO the &quot;up&quot; link relation as it&#39;s defined is a bit limiting,\nsince it says that the resource is a &quot;list of parent resources&quot;, when the\nnormal case would be (in a hierarchy) that an item only has a single parent.\n I would have fixed it by having many &quot;up&quot; links when a resource belongs to\ndifferent hierarchies, or is part of a directed graph.
