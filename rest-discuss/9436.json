You have an element containing whitespace\n&gt;&gt; text nodes and elements, and each subelement in turn contains\n&gt;&gt; whitespace text nodes and two elements, each of which contains\n&gt;&gt; a text node.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then problem being what? This is easy to suck into a Hashtable API if \n&gt; you like. The issue is the APIs, not the markup.\n&gt; \n&gt; JSON is a clever kludge designed to work within the limitations of \n&gt; JavaScript 1.0 and browser APIs. However if E4X had been reliably \n&gt; available across browsers it would never have been necessary, and \n&gt; probably wouldn&#39;t have been invented.\n\nJS 1.2 actually, not that it matters a whit.\n\nSorry guys, but this back and forwards between the two of you reads like as if\nyou&#39;re both arguing over whether a Toyota Corolla or a DAF 95XF is the better\nvehicle.\n\nBoth JSON and XML serve different purposes, the former being a simple way to\nserialise common datastructures, and the latter being a general-purpose markup\nlanguage. Sure, their domains overlap, but they&#39;re optimised for different\nthings. Sure, you can use one to do things the other does, but it&#39;s neither\nnatural nor comfortable. Similarly, while you _could_ use an 95XF as a family\ncar, you&#39;d look like an even bigger ass than a Humvee driver, and while you\ncould _try_ pulling a lorry trailer with a Corolla, you wouldn&#39;t get very\nfar.\n\nSeriously, why not argue about something more useful, bikeshed colours, for\ninstance.\n\nK.\n\n-- \nBlacknight Internet Solutions Ltd. &lt;http://blacknight.ie/&gt;\nUnit 12A Barrowside Business Park, Sleaty Road, Graiguecullen, Carlow, Ireland\nCompany No.: 370845\n\n"}}
