It will follow the REST\nphilosophy better if 201 or 202 means created or accepted *at the\nresource/representation level* and nothing more.\n\nGiven the example we&#39;re discussing here [1], the first POST is sending a\nrepresentation of a new trip that is to be subordinate to the &#39;trip&#39; resource ,\nand up to the server to process accordingly.  If generically (in the REST sense)\na subordinate resource was created, then 201 seems most appropriate.  202 would\nbe more appropriate if the subordinate resource was accepted by the server, but\nnot created at the time the response was sent to the user agent.\n\nIs that a clear way of seeing it?\n\n-Philip\n\n[1] http://conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/RestGoesToMaui for people new to this\ndiscussion.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: S.
