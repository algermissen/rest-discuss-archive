The late discovery constrain is there to allow flexibility=\r\n in the system. You can chance anything, anytime, and the client will not b=\r\nreak, that is the idea.\n\n2. WADL, just as WSDL (that, BTW, has a mime type =\r\ntoo), can be used for design time discovery, and thus making fixed clients =\r\nthat break when something changes. Still, WSDL, and WADL, can be used dynam=\r\nically, if the client loads them at runtime and process accordingly. Note h=\r\nere they are used as hypertext.\n\n3. Now, if you don&#39;t use them, you can sti=\r\nll make breakable clients. For instance, there are people that code the cli=\r\nent knowing URLs and semantics, and if something changes all goes havoc. No=\r\nte that using all that is needed for REST, including HATEOAS, gives you the=\r\n top level in Ruby&#39;s maturity model, but eliminating HATEOAS you drop to th=\r\ne level below. Even some REST frameworks do not provide HATEOAS, which can =\r\ntell you how hard is to accomplish that.\n\n4. Ok. But there is a design prob=\r\nlem with all this, and it is about semantics. Media types are simple artifa=\r\ncts that you know how to handle, but they can have different semantics. A m=\r\nedia type like WSLD is to describe web services, so it is a protocol level =\r\nsemantic driven thing. A Cargo media type is an element from the applicatio=\r\nn domain, so its semantics are different. When modeling, mixing semantics i=\r\ns not a good thing. So, following a line of discovery can be done following=\r\n a particular semantic line for the app, or following a general semantic li=\r\nne for the protocol. That is, I can write a general purpose client using th=\r\ne WSDL, or an specific purpose client following the Cargo. Particularly, as=\r\n I just mention, having protocol information inside the Cargo definition do=\r\nes not appeal to me. Mixing. It is better to design the links in the cargo =\r\nas domain driven links, not protocol driven. So, any client that understand=\r\ns what a cargo is, can follow the link since it is semantically representat=\r\nive to it. Complicated, I know.\n\n5. Lastly, SOAP is not that ugly. It has b=\r\neen very badly used, and may not fit as nicely to REST. We can think of it =\r\nas a layer on top of REST that reduces REST capabilities, but does so becau=\r\nse it is a general purpose thing that can be used on other protocols, not o=\r\nnly HTTP, and thus not only WEB.\n\nHope this clarifies, it is like a summary=\r\n of what has been expressed. Sort of.\n\nCheers. \nWilliam Martinez. \n\n\n--- In=\r\n rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Giacomo Tesio &lt;giacomo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello=\r\n list! :-D\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve read a lot of criticism to WADL (see for example\n&gt; htt=\r\np://bitworking.org/news/193/Do-we-need-WADL), since it could lead to\n&gt; some=\r\nthing like WSDL/SOAP/RPC/Berlusconi & other human&#39;s fault.\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW, I&#39;d li=\r\nke to use it as a hypertext as in\n&gt; http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest=\r\n-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven\n&gt; \n&gt; It would be possible?\n&gt; \n&gt; Actually a w=\r\nadl file should have it&#39;s own mime type (does it have one?) but\n&gt; it seem q=\r\nuite good as hypertext language as far as the client can handle it\n&gt; (throu=\r\ngh, for example, some code on demand).\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not considering it a tool t=\r\no generate such code (even if it would be\n&gt; possible, and as far as the cod=\r\ne is downloaded with the wadl, still\n&gt; restful), but just a simple and clea=\r\nn way to connect the resources.\n&gt; \n&gt; It seem to me that nothing restfully w=\r\nrong to use an alternative hypertext\n&gt; language instead of html, isn&#39;t it?\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Giacomo\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
