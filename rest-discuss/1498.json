A best practices\ndocument would be very useful and your set is a very good start.\n\nOne of your points does bring up some recent thinking on my part:\n\n&gt; 3. As a corollary to (2) use nouns in the logical URI, not verbs. \n&gt; Resources are &quot;things&quot; not &quot;actions&quot;.\n\nI know this perspective has been talked about regarding REST, but recently\nI&#39;ve shifted my thinking to view the trade-offs between the nouns vs. verbs\nas a tangential issue.  To the extent that URIs should be view as an\nuniversal resource addressing scheme, I really don&#39;t know if we need or want\nto limit resources to be &quot;nouns&quot;.\n\nIf we insist that URIs be nouns, we are basically saying that we should use\na different addressing scheme to implement &quot;verbs&quot;.  In some ways, we are\njustifying the need for something like SOAP in that that SOAP is a way to\ndefine &quot;verbs&quot; that act on the &quot;nouns&quot; addressable via URIs.\n\nWhy should we not expose method calls via URIs so that they can participate\nin the network effects?  If I want to publish a web service that allows\ncontrol of the AC in my building, why should I not provide individual links\nfor &quot;On&quot;, &quot;Off&quot;, and &quot;Adjust Temperature&quot;?  E-commerce sites to this all the\ntime with buttons that &quot;Add to cart&quot; or &quot;Submit transaction&quot;.\n\nMaybe another way to look at this is to look at the core &quot;GET, PUT, POST,\nand DELETE&quot; as basic &quot;access&quot; mechanisms of an addressing scheme, not really\n&quot;verbs&quot; in the sense of actions we would like to perform on things.  So,\nREST isn&#39;t about reducing the &quot;verbs&quot; and making as many things &quot;nouns&quot; as\npossible, but about having an universal addressing and access mechanism.\n\nThis also relates to the idea that it is preferable to avoid query strings.\nThis is certainly valid for accessing real &quot;noun&quot; type resources.  But, in\nmany cases, query strings are used when we are really accessing &quot;verb&quot; type\nresources.  For example, I think it is a real stretch to say that a Google\nsearch URI is pointing at a &quot;noun&quot; type resource.  We are basically asking\nGoogle&#39;s search (&quot;verb&quot;) resource to do a search for us and we pass along\nour search criteria as query strings.\n\n//Joe\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Roger L. Costello [mailto:costello@...]\nSent: Wednesday, June 12, 2002 12:06 PM\nTo: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com; Costello,Roger L.\nSubject: [rest-discuss] REST Best Practices\n\n\nHas anyone put together a set of Best Practices for creating REST\nservices?  If not, how about getting started on one?  Here&#39;s some that\ncome to mind:\n\n1. Provide a URI for each resource that you want (or will want)\nexposed.  This is consistent with Tim Berners-Lee&#39;s axioms for the Web,\nas well as the W3 TAG recomendations.\n\n2. Prefer URIs that are logical over URIs that are physical.  For\nexample:\n\n   Prefer:\n     http://www.boeing.com/airplanes/747\n   Over:\n     http://www.boeing.com/airplanes/747.html\n\nLogical URIs allow the resource implementation to change without\nimpacting client applications.\n\n3. As a corollary to (2) use nouns in the logical URI, not verbs. \nResources are &quot;things&quot; not &quot;actions&quot;.\n\n4. Make all HTTP GETs side-effect free.  Doing so makes the request\n&quot;safe&quot;.\n\n5. Use links in your responses to requests!  Doing so connects your\nresponse with other data.  It enables client applications to be\n&quot;self-propelled&quot;.  That is, the response itself contains info about\n&quot;what&#39;s the next step to take&quot;.  Contrast this to responses that do not\ncontain links.  Thus, the decision of &quot;what&#39;s the next step to take&quot;\nmust be made out-of-band.\n\n6. Minimize the use of query strings.  For example:\n\n    Prefer:\n         http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/00345\n    Over: \n         http://www.parts-depot.com/parts?part-id=00345\n\nRationale: it&#39;s easier for Web intermedaries such as proxy servers to\nevaluate a request when it doesn&#39;t need to parse a query string.\n\nWhat else?
