Bowman schrieb:\n&gt;  &gt;I do agree that it&#39;s good to have a separate URI when there&#39;s a chance\n&gt;  &gt;that that representation is authorable, or that people may want to\n&gt;  &gt;bookmark it. It&#39;s not entirely clear to my why it&#39;s desirable in the\n&gt;  &gt;general case (why does it matter?).\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; It matters because there is another resource involved whether one\n&gt; acknowledges its presence by assigning it a URI, or not. It does not matter\n\nWell, no. There doesn&#39;t need to be &quot;another&quot; resource at all. Just \nbecause the representation varies on request parameters doesn&#39;t mean at \nall that there must be another resource involved. It could be that way, \nbut it doesn&#39;t have to be that way.\n\n&gt; to a user-agent, it matters to the definition of content negotiation. When\n&gt; a resource is negotiated, it is not a box of apples containing a Red\n&gt; Delicious apple and a Golden Delicious apple. It is a box of apples which\n&gt; has been divided into one container (bin) for Red Delicious apples and\n&gt; another container for Golden Delicious apples. To dereference an apple one\n&gt; is reaching into a box of apples, yes, but one is reaching into one bin or\n&gt; the other, and those bins (boxes) should be identified with URIs in a REST\n&gt; system simply because they&#39;re resources.\n\nSo who says that a server should assign a URI to a resource even though \nit doesn&#39;t plan to make it accessible under that URI?\n\n&gt;  &gt;How is that relevant to the client? Also, what&#39;s the definition of an\n&gt;  &gt;&quot;endpoint&quot;?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Not sure where I said any of this is relevant to the client? The semantics\n\nYou said:\n\n&quot;If you can&#39;t assign each of your variants a URI, how do you know your \nnegotiated resource isn&#39;t an endpoint?&quot;\n\nThat&#39;s up to the server to decide, right? I don&#39;t think it makes sense \nto force URI assignment if a resource won&#39;t be accessible under it \n(actually, I would think that&#39;s a bad idea).\n\nOf course that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a good idea to expose as much of your \nsystem&#39;s internals as possible as separate resources. However, REST \ndoesn&#39;t seem to require that (or if it does, please point me to the text \nsection).\n\n&gt; of the mapping for a REST resource is static, as can be shown using \n&gt; basic set\n&gt; theory and simple two-circle Venn diagrams. When the semantics of the \n&gt; mapping\n&gt; for a resource can&#39;t be defined in such fashion, I say that makes it non-\n&gt; static and hence, an endpoint.\n\nAs I don&#39;t know what is meant by &quot;endpoint&quot;, it&#39;s hard to argue with.\n\nRoy says:\n\n&quot;More precisely, a resource R is a temporally varying membership \nfunction MR(t), which for time t maps to a set of entities, or values, \nwhich are equivalent. The values in the set may be resource \nrepresentations and/or resource identifiers. A resource can map to the \nempty set, which allows references to be made to a concept before any \nrealization of that concept exists -- a notion that was foreign to most \nhypertext systems prior to the Web [61]. Some resources are static in \nthe sense that, when examined at any time after their creation, they \nalways correspond to the same value set. Others have a high degree of \nvariance in their value over time. The only thing that is required to be \nstatic for a resource is the semantics of the mapping, since the \nsemantics is what distinguishes one resource from another.&quot;\n\n(&lt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_2_1_1&gt;)\n\n\nCould you clarify how this definition relates to your usage of the term \n&quot;endpoint&quot;?\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n"}}
