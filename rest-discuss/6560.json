Wouldn&#39;t it make sense\n&gt;&gt; to ask the resource what it is capable of?\n&gt;\n&gt; The best way to discover what a resource is capable of is probably to\n&gt; try the thing you need it to do, and see if it succeeds or fails. \n\nThat&#39;s not very good advice if the thing to try is &quot;debit bankaccount&quot;\n\n\n&gt; Doing an OPTIONS on a resource you already know you want to hold a\n&gt; conversation with is not as useful in practical REST as it might seem,\n&gt; unless perhaps you are a human being trying to debug a faulty\n&gt; interaction.\n\nBut we ought to be able to work towards completely automatic discovery\nof services. OPTIONS does allow part of that.\n\nFor example, you might have a url of a service and do an OPTIONS and\nsee that it supports GET and POST so you GET it and it returns an HTML\nFORM. The FORM is tagged up to POST back to the same URL. \n\nBut what is supposed to go into the various fields? what will the\neffect of the POST be? Are the fact that the url supports a GET and a\nPOST related?\n\n\nThis of course is a really hard problem and I don&#39;t think WSDL/SOAP\ndoes it either.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
