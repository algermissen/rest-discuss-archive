Paul may consider optional parameters a simplification, \nbut from a toolkit perspective it is a complexity.  It also doesn&#39;t \nhelp that there isn&#39;t a one-to-one and onto mapping between section 5 \ndefined types and implementation languages like Java.  Or that \nsection 5 diverges from XML Schema.\n \nThere are a few other considerations, such as headers which allow for \ncross-cutting concerns to be addressed, and some investment in \ntransport independence.\n\n&gt; In simple implementations, like XML-RPC, marshalling is about half \nof\n&gt; the implementation with procedure call semantics the other half.\n&gt; Creating an HTTP request library that just marhsalls data should be\n&gt; that much simpler than one that relays calls.\n\nIn Axis, the RPC provider is just one modest sized class.  It extends \nthe Java provider, and I must confess that there is some other \nknowledge of RPC that bleeds through in some minor ways in other \nparts of the implementation (clearly not ideal, but I&#39;m being \nbrutally honest here).\n\nThe RPC advocates have clearly articulated how such a marshalling \ninfrastructure can be used to implement their preferred style of \ninteraction.  I can&#39;t help but wonder if it would be possible for \nthis to be done with REST.\n\n\n"}}
