These two are linked via rdf:class, but \nthey have different semantics (in the formal sense, their model theories \nare not the same). What this means is that if you serve OWL content \nusing an RDF media type, consuming clients are not expected to consume \nit with an OWL reasoner and if they do, any inferences drawn by an OWL \napplying client can be repudiated by servers. It&#39;s not actually OWL \naccording to Web architecture.\n\nNow add in the XML media type. If I serve an RDF document as \napplication/xml can you apply an RDF reasoner to it? What about FOAF? Or \nan HTML page with hCard, SVG, RDFa and hAtom? It&#39;s all undefined.\n\nDropping down to lexical forms and namespaces, if I serve an Atom feed \nas application/xml, are you allowed to consume it as Atom? And if you \nare, in what can clients reasonably expect servers to stand over? What \nabout those DRM and other extensions people are going to add as AtomPub \nsees wider adoption for integrations?\n\nAs far as I can tell, this is big, big gap in the Web&#39;s as-deployed \narchitecture. XML formats can be mixed up without any guidelines as to \nwhat downstream clients can assume of the data. Semantic web formats \nhave significant variation in what they can deduce.  JSON is arguably in \nan even worse place as it has no technical basis for anything other than \ncode on demand. I don&#39;t know where to start with RDFa - how is lexical \ntunneling any better than transport tunneling?\n\nThis isn&#39;t a problem now as we don&#39;t ship around much content that needs \nreasoners. We deal with low level bugs like encoding screwups and \nmalformed, but technically Content-Type supersedes any claims made \ninside the content itself. Worse, Content-Type is optional in both HTTP \nand XML. yes, there&#39;s RFC3023, but it&#39;s a technical description of a \nswitch block that only deals with encoding issues, not semantics. Give \nit enough time and enough automated agents, and there&#39;ll be a lawsuit \nfiled over a discrepancy between what a client assumed and what a server \nexpected.\n\n\n&gt;  &gt; AtomPub constrains REST and is manifested via HTTP. It doesn&#39;t nest\n&gt;  &gt; inside HTTP. Aside from the usual transport/transfer objections to\n&gt;  &gt; protocol tunneling, actual physical nesting incurs other problems. For\n&gt;  &gt; example you introduce security attack vectors, eg one can nest HTTP\n&gt;  &gt; inside HTTP for the purposes of achieving a batch protocol, but it\n&gt;  &gt; requires the consuming code be able to safely parse HTTP instead of\n&gt;  &gt; leaving that to server infrastructure.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry for the confusion. I put &quot;nested&quot; in quotes and asked for a better \n&gt; way to &quot;put it&quot; to avoid such confusion. I did not mean to imply \n&gt; physical nesting (though I could make the argument that the Atom schema \n&gt; physically nests inside the HTTP &quot;envelope&quot;). I meant nested in terms of \n&gt; &quot;further constrained&quot;.\n\nThanks, I get it now.\n\n&gt; I hope that in delving into all these details, we don&#39;t lose sight of \n&gt; the main issue: the meaning of the &quot;application neutral&quot; constraint and \n&gt; the motivation behind it.\n\nUnderstood. But I think the content and semantic mixing issues are real, \nnot just theoretical and are more likely to occur as user agents become \nmore automated.\n\nBill\n\n"}}
