Through cleverness and experience you can\nkeep it to a minimum, but sometimes it&#39;s just a fact.  Requiring\nrepresentational completeness has no impact when it comes down to state\nwhich goes through a complicated transition despite a clean interface.\n\nIt&#39;s not possible to avoid those sitatuations.  Giving every tiny\naddressable sub-component a URI would result in a map of the world the\nsize of the world.  That&#39;s too fine grained a type of interaction.\n\n- Lucas\n\nOn Wed, 19 May 2004, Lucas Gonze wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Wed, 19 May 2004, S.
