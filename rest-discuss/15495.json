That guarantee can&#39;t\nbe made for architectures which deviate from REST.=\r\n  It&#39;s simply a fact\nthat the Uniform Interface degrades efficiency; overco=\r\nming this\nlimitation results in a non-Uniform Interface, i.e. something tha=\r\nt\nfundamentally isn&#39;t REST, so the serendipitous re-use benefit of the\nUnif=\r\norm Interface can&#39;t be said to apply.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Nevertheless what interests me i=\r\nn this particular example (serving\n&gt; different sets of fields to different =\r\nusers) is it&#39;s use not to\n&gt; shrink the data volume on the wire but for secu=\r\nrity reasons, as a way\n&gt; to implement some kind of &quot;roles&quot; where users of t=\r\nype A can get\n&gt; fields A B and C and users of type B just A and B (another =\r\nscenario\n&gt; will be custom reporting). The approach used by LinkedIn seems t=\r\no\n&gt; implement too much coupling between client and server, but what are\n&gt; t=\r\nhe alternatives? Is the media-type alternative viable?\n&gt;\n\nIf you look at my=\r\n online demo, you&#39;ll see that every steady-state is\ngenerated using an XSLT=\r\n stylesheet.  My real solution is to make that\nXSLT stylesheet URI negotiat=\r\ne based on user authentication.  So each\nuser gets their own role-based (or=\r\n personalized) XSLT, without changing\nthe initial representation or its URI=\r\n.  More importantly, without\nmaking a whole bunch of individualized sub-res=\r\nources with username or\nrole information in the URIs.\n\nThis technique may b=\r\ne used for any resource included by the initial\nrepresentation, so you can =\r\neffectively restrict content, or offer\ndifferent interface capabilities, ba=\r\nsed on user role.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
