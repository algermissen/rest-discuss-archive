What are the  \n&gt; design\n&gt; &gt; conditions that lead to the creation =\r\nof new resource state? Etc.)  \n&gt; I am\n&gt; &gt; trying to get away from the &quot;you =\r\ncould do this and you could do that\n&gt; &gt; but you also could do it that way&quot; =\r\nkinds of answers to practical  \n&gt; REST\n&gt; &gt; design questions.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think I =\r\nsee what you are driving at with your distinction between  \n&gt; session state=\r\n vs resource state, but I don&#39;t think the distinction  \n&gt; is so clean in RE=\r\nST. Here&#39;s a relevant passage from Roy&#39;s thesis  \n&gt; (5.3.3):\n&gt;\n&gt; The applic=\r\nation state is controlled and stored by the user agent and  \n&gt; can be compo=\r\nsed of representations from multiple servers. In  \n&gt; addition to freeing th=\r\ne server from the scalability problems of  \n&gt; storing state, this allows th=\r\ne user to directly manipulate the state  \n&gt; (e.g., a Web browser&#39;s history)=\r\n, anticipate changes to that state  \n&gt; (e.g., link maps and prefetching of =\r\nrepresentations), and jump from  \n&gt; one application to another (e.g., bookm=\r\narks and URI-entry dialogs).  \n&gt; [emphasis added]\n&gt;\n&gt; So at least a copy of=\r\n the resource state (in the form or a  \n&gt; representation of that resource) =\r\nis intended to be stored and  \n&gt; manipulated on the client side. For exampl=\r\ne, I believe this 5.3.3  \n&gt; paragraph endorses the following scenario:\n&gt; \t=\r\n=95 client receives a representation of the works of art in a museum  \n&gt; ex=\r\nhibit as list of art works (name of work, name of artist) from a  \n&gt; museum=\r\n service on some museum server\n&gt; \t=95 the client extracts the name of an ar=\r\ntist (a string) from the  \n&gt; list and submits it to Wikipedia on a differen=\r\nt set of servers\n&gt; \t=95 It takes the representation from Wikipedia and form=\r\nats it into a  \n&gt; popup for the user&#39;s UI visualization of the museum exhib=\r\nit\n&gt; In this scenario the client &quot;jumps from one application (museum  \n&gt; se=\r\nrvice) to another (Wikipedia)&quot;, submitting representation data it  \n&gt; recei=\r\nved from the first service to the second service. Your  \n&gt; description abov=\r\ne seems to prohibit such a scenario (&quot;to continue  \n&gt; its interaction with =\r\nthe service on another machine, it would not  \n&gt; only need to take the appr=\r\nopriate URIs with it ... but also other  \n&gt; data elements&quot;).\n&gt;\n\nBut in your=\r\n scenario, the client could allways, just be use of the one  \ninitial URI, =\r\npick up the interaction. And this is (IMHO) exactly the  \nsignificance of s=\r\ntoring the application data as resource state - so  \nthat the client can pi=\r\nck it up again. If the data was not stored in  \nthe server it would have to=\r\n be stored on the client and the ability  \nwould be lost to pick up the con=\r\nversation just on the basis of the URI.\n\nJan\n\n\n\n&gt; It appears that REST endo=\r\nrses the use of &quot;application data&quot; stored  \n&gt; on the client, at least in th=\r\ne case where such data was at some  \n&gt; point in the past received by the cl=\r\nient as part of a representation  \n&gt; of a server-based resource.\n&gt;\n&gt; -- Nic=\r\nk\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n--------------------------------------\nJan Algermissen\n\nMail: a=\r\nlgermissen@...\nBlog: http://algermissen.blogspot.com/\nHome: http://www.=\r\njalgermissen.com\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n"}}
