   links to HTTP(S) resources with information that otherwise might be\n&gt;&gt;    discovered by interacting with them.\n\ngenerally speaking, i think this might become a very useful way how \nvarious services can expose more helpful links to clients, if they \nchoose to do so, and if the clients are interesting in taking that \ninformation into account.\n\nbut i have one question about the general registry model: the current \ndraft says that hints MUST have a name (very reasonable, of course), but \nalso that hints MUST have their data model being defined in JSON.\n\nhttp://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-link-hint-00#section-5.1\n\nliving in a world where we have JSON services, XML services, and RDF \nservices, it seems that hard-coding a specific language data model into \nsuch a spec (without constraining it in any way) will limit the utility \nof such a registry. for example, in the Home Document draft, which is \nthe original source of the link hint idea, the hints were hard-coded \nwith very constrained data models. this made it relatively easy to \nexpose them in a different syntax (in the XML Home Document draft):\n\nhttp://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-home-xml-01#page-4\n\nwithout getting too much into the details of this specific registry: \nwhat are the best practices about allowing/controlling language \ndependencies in registries? personally, i would feel more comfortable \nwith having a registry that is of equal value to people regardless of \ntheir implementation language, but then again that means that the \nregistry itself must define a &quot;mini-language&quot; of its own.\n\nany pointers to similar situations and how they were resolved would be \ngreatly appreciated. thanks and cheers,\n\ndret.\n\n-- \nerik wilde | mailto:dret@...  -  tel:+1-510-2061079 |\n            | UC Berkeley  -  School of Information (ISchool) |\n            | http://dret.net/netdret http://twitter.com/dret |\n\n"}}
