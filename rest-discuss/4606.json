Amazon isn&#39;t that religious (or even\nparticularly\n&gt; &gt; well informed) about REST. I&#39;ve only met two or three people that\n&gt; &gt; understand - much less care deeply - about REST. I have met people that\n&gt; &gt; quickly recognize the value when I explain the basics, though.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t find that particularly surprising Mike.\n&gt; Following this most recent thread makes grabbing eels look easy.\n&gt;\nThese discussions are fairly high-level and somewhat academic - I&#39;d just\nlike to see the basics happening consistently across new systems being built\ninto the Web.\n\nAlso it would be nice when talking with the actual teams in meetings to\nreview schemas and data models that they can actually talk about REST\nsomewhat or at least know what kind of HTTP headers exist. To be fair, they\nare pretty focused on a small set of use-cases - mainly &#39;do all retrievals\nfrom an XSLT processor that can access only one resource at a time and has\nbroken HTTP client libraries&#39;. I think I did convince them that standards\nsupport should at least be available for developers that are literate enough\nto read a spec, rather than just deliver something in order to work around\nbroken clients.\nAlso, there are major groups that don&#39;t even realize that their support of\ndoing a flat-file upload via a browser actually /is/ a Web service. Every\ntime I mention it, they just don&#39;t get it and say &quot;oh, but that won&#39;t scale&quot;\nor &quot;that can&#39;t work&quot; or &quot;the community wants soap&quot;, etc... yet it does scale\nand it does work and nobody really needs soap. And it&#39;s /their own system/.\nGo figure.\n\n\n"}}
