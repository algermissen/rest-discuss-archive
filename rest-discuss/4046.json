For distributed control of shared resources, we enforce \nACID transactions by further extending REST with end-to-end Decision\nfunctions that enable each component to serialize all updates \n(ARREST+D).\n\nThe alternative to simultaneous agreement is decentralization: \npermitting independent agents to make their own decisions. This \nrequires accommodating four intrinsic sources of uncertainty that \narise when communicating with remote agencies: loss, congestion, \ndelay, and disagreement. Their corresponding constraints are Best-\neffort data transfer, Efficient summarization of data to be sent, \nApproximate estimates of current values from data already received, \nand Self-centered trust management.\n\nThese so-called &#39;BASE&#39; properties can be enforced by replacing \nreferences to shared resources with end-to-end Estimator functions. \nSuch extensions to REST can increase precision of measurements of a \nsingle remote resource (ARREST+E); as well as increase accuracy by \nassessing the opinions of several different agencies (ARRESTED). The \ncontributions of this work include: a formal definition of \ndecentralization; an analysis of the limitations of consensus-based \nsoftware architectural styles; derivation of new architectural styles \nthat can enforce the required properties; and implementations that \ndemonstrate the feasibility of those styles and sample applications.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
