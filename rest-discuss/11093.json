If they\n&gt; don&#39;t map directly to the other elements of Atom.\n\nYeah that was the scheme I was thinking of (using RDF+Atom, specifically).\n\n&gt; I have created parser + serialize methods on my objects and are using\n&gt; them on both client and server side.. You only need an AtomPub library\n&gt; to handle the communication (++).\n\nAbdera seems like a good fit for that.\n\n&gt; You might have to cache, or do something clever on the client side if\n&gt; the response times are slow, but I guess there are a lot of techniques\n&gt; to do that both for GUIs and of course for REST in general.\n\nI expect my clients to be in Java, so caching should be fine. And the \ncaching, and possibility to do routing, is one of the main reasons I \nwant to use REST as the &quot;protocol&quot;, even though an all-Java RMI-based \none would have &quot;worked&quot; as well.\n\n/Rickard\n\n"}}
