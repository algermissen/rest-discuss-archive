The RFC \ndoesn&#39;t say\n&gt; much about sequencing of possible subcomponents of a URI path \nsegment.\n\nFrom an implementation point of view I have control over the \nbehaviour of the URI parser and could therefore normalize paths that \ndiffer only in the order of parameters contained in a path segment. \n\nIn defining an implementation-specific rule for how to handle this \nunspecified behaviour would I be doing something inherently un-\nRESTful?\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, it&#39;s interesting to note that the RFC uses &#39;parameter&#39; to \ntalk about\n&gt; subcomponents of path segments (the stuff between slashes) but most\n&gt; programmers use the term &#39;parameter&#39; to talk about the query terms \n(the\n&gt; stuff after the question mark).\n\nI feel that your point about most programmers thinking \nof &#39;parameters&#39; in URIs in terms of what goes into the query string \nis an important one as consumers of the web service I&#39;m designing \nmay not be familiar with REST.  For a widely-used, public interface \nmight the URI: /location?x=00001&y=00002 be more sociable?\n\nRegards\nAdam\n\n\n\n\n"}}
