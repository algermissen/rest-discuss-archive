Th=\r\nat being said, if you really feel such support\n&gt; is required a media type b=\r\nased extension is a good way to provide it.\n&gt; For example, &lt;http://example.=\r\ncom/foo.msv&gt; for version 1 and\n&gt; &lt;http://example.com/foo.msv2&gt; for version =\r\n2.  The use of extensions\n&gt; implies to the humans involved that these two r=\r\nesources are basically\n&gt; the same except for the the format of their repres=\r\nentations.  Your\n&gt; server development platform might even provide this for =\r\nfree.  (RoR\n&gt; does, for example.)\n&gt; \n&gt; It is worth noting that it is better=\r\n, whenever possible, to extend the\n&gt; existing media type rather than creati=\r\nng a new incompatible version.\n&gt; However, that is not always possible.  Whe=\r\nn a break with the past is\n&gt; required creating media types is the best avai=\r\nlable solution.\n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt; &lt;http://barelyenough.org&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\nI disagree that =\r\nthis is a misuse of HTTP.
