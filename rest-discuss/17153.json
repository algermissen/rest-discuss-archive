This can easily be convert=\r\ned to XML using standard tools:\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;case xmlns=3D&quot;http://my-casefile-names=\r\npace&quot;&gt; &lt;title&gt;My title&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/case&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; But how would the machine readab=\r\nle HTML look like? Maybe:\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;div property=3D&quot;case&quot;&gt; &lt;div property=3D&quot;titl=\r\ne&quot;&gt;My title&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;\n\nHopefully, something that makes better use of HTM=\r\nL semantics like:\n\n&lt;article&gt;&lt;h1 property=3D&quot;case:title&quot;&gt;My title&lt;/h1&gt; ...  =\r\n&lt;/article&gt;\n\n&gt; So I feel trapped somewhere between these two formats and I g=\r\nuess that is why\n&gt; people turn to their own media-types. Now they get easy =\r\ntooling and embedded\n&gt; hypermedia controls in XML (which they must invent t=\r\nhemselves).\n\nThis sounds like more work for both producers and consumers th=\r\nan just\nserializing to an HTML form.\n\nThose insistent on rolling out domain=\r\n-specific XML elements, rather than using\nRDFa/microdata/classes to embed t=\r\nhe same vocabulary into an HTML user\ninterface, could at least mix in XHTML=\r\n, XForms, XLink, and WAI-ARIA with\ntheir domain-specific vocabulary rather =\r\nthan reinvent the wheel.\n\n&gt; Can&#39;t we combine and get the best of both world=\r\ns?\n&gt;\n&gt; What is needed is something that:\n&gt;\n&gt; - Makes it easy to serialize/d=\r\neserialize any data (m2m scenario).  - Is\n&gt; browsable with a normal browser=\r\n (h2m scenario).  - Has hyper media controls.\n&gt; - Can update data through h=\r\nyper media controls.\n\nIf by &quot;easy&quot; you mean as easy as serializing name-val=\r\nue pairs into an XML\nelement tree, then these goals are in conflict, becaus=\r\ne magically building a\ngood user interface for h2m is hard to script - inde=\r\ned such interfaces are an\narea of outright competition rather than just sta=\r\nndardization! Consequently,\ndevelopers tend to want to customize cookie-cut=\r\nter user interfaces, replacing\nthe scaffolding erected by web frameworks.\n\n=\r\n&gt; The HTML form could have RDFa added to it to lessen the coupling between =\r\nthe\n&gt; server and the client, like Eric suggested. Something like:\n\n[snip]\n\n=\r\n&gt; &lt;input id=3D&quot;case_title&quot; name=3D&quot;Case.Title&quot; property=3D&quot;dc:title&quot;/&gt;\n\nNot=\r\ne this does not work since RDFa takes the content of the RDFa &quot;content&quot;\natt=\r\nribute or, failing that, the concatenated text nodes of the element as the\n=\r\nvalue, *not* the &quot;value&quot; property of the &quot;input&quot;, as the value of &quot;dc:title=\r\n&quot;:\n\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-core/#sequence\n\nWhat you want to say is that =\r\nthe .value property may or should be a &quot;dc:title&quot;,\nbut HTML5 and friends do=\r\n not currently offer a way to express that.\n\nAdding a way to do this is not=\r\n easy since &quot;value&quot; might or might not be a\nprovided or valid value.\n\n--\nBe=\r\nnjamin Hawkes-Lewis\n\n"}}
