The trick with that is\nthat you have to retrieve the object before knowing what type it is if you\nwant to provide a representation. Another issue is what happens if a user\nreplaces &#39;patients/UUID&#39; with &#39;doctors/UUID&#39; but uses the UUID of a patient.\n(you are going to make doctors into numbers too, not just patients, right?)\n\n\n&gt; The reason that the orders for each patient aren&#39;t located &quot;beneath&quot; each\npatient is for the reason that\n&gt; patients can be merged. That would &quot;move&quot; each order from one patient to\nthe other.\n&gt; I didn&#39;t want the URIs to change.\nGood thinking.\n\n\n&gt; What I really love about the idea is that each representation could\ncontain an xml-stylesheet PI so that\n&gt; we could easily traverse the model using IE6\nYeah - cool stuff. I haven&#39;t played with this much in the past few years, so\nI&#39;m not sure what the best way to get &#39;device independence&#39; - essentially\nuser-agent detection. Should the URI of the XSL return different XSL for\ndifferent devices? Should there be multiple PIs in the XML? Should the PI in\nthe XML be different for different user-agents? etc...\n\n\n\n\n"}}
