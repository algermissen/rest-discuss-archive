These ACTIONS will result in &quot;shifting\n&gt; APPLICATION&#39;S=\r\n focus&quot; (blah, there has to be a better term) from\n&gt; originally targeted RE=\r\nSOURCE to another RESOURCE (by\n&gt; creating/updating/retrieving that another =\r\nRESOURCE ?), and our client\n&gt; will receive the REPRESENTATION of that RESOU=\r\nRCE, thus being\n&gt; TRANSFERED (the client) to a NEW STATE.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; As you can =\r\nsee, I&#39;m a bit confused about what&#39;s actually happening on\n&gt; the server and=\r\n how that fits in REST&#39;s boundaries. That &quot;shifting of\n&gt; focus&quot; is basicall=\r\ny a lame statement trying to express that there is\n&gt; some kind of transitio=\r\nn of state happening on the server too - we do\n&gt; have some application whos=\r\ne back-end processes are implemented in some\n&gt; programming language. When a=\r\n request (URI+operation) hits a resource,\n&gt; some of those back-end processe=\r\ns are being triggered, resulting\n&gt; effectively in &quot;some kind of change of t=\r\nhe STATE&quot; - state of those\n&gt; back-end processes (but obviously that&#39;s anoth=\r\ner kind of state, not\n&gt; the state that REST is all about). When these proce=\r\nsses are completed,\n&gt; we have as the result that another RESTful RESOURCE, =\r\nwhose\n&gt; representation will be delivered to the client as server&#39;s response=\r\n to\n&gt; the initial request.\n&gt; \n\nWell, looks like there exists that other &quot;ki=\r\nnd of state change&quot; - the\nmuch anticipated book &quot;RESTful Web Services&quot; (pre=\r\nview chapter,\nhttp://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529260/chapter/ch04.pdf=\r\n, page\n15) shed some light - it makes clear distinction between &quot;applicatio=\r\nn\nstate&quot; (living on client) and &quot;resource state&quot; (living on server and\nbein=\r\ng identical for all clients). And it seems that both are equally\nimportant =\r\nto REST.\n\nAny thoughts/comments/suggestions?\n\nRegards,\n    Miran\n\n\n"}}
