Very useful, but not very REST.\nBut of course, that&#39;s the way the Web was built too...\n\n\nThere are two approaches (that I know of - I&#39;m a newbie to blog\ninfrastructure)\n - trackback (from MoveableType)\n - pingback\n\nGenerally these both allow a blog to subscribe to a different blog - the\noriginal blog is then notified when new entries are added to the second\nblog, etc.\nUnfortunately, neither use the terms publish, subscribe, notify, etc. very\noften. The term &#39;ping&#39; generally means &#39;notify&#39;.\nThis system is currently used to establish cross-links between items. Since\nit is a bare-bones pub/sub system, it will grow into more uses.\nGenerally, this is creating a semi-distributed discussion/mail/discussion\nsystem. Semi-distributed in the sense that individual entries in a\nseries/thread do not need to reside on a single server, but the messages are\nstill on a server rather than being downloaded to a client (like the way\nemail works). It shows the power of distributed hyper-linking (I&#39;m sure\nPaulP is all over this...).\n\n\nTrackBack\n-----------\nhttp://www.movabletype.org/docs/mtmanual_trackback.html\nTrackBack says they use a REST model for its pings, but they use GET to\nperform the notification. It&#39;s be better to use POST, either with an XML\nbody or a x-www-form-urlencoded (classical form data) body. I haven&#39;t found\nout why they used GET.\nThey also provide a listing of previous notifications (pings) on a\nparticular blog entry. It is assumed that all notifications contain a link\nto a related posting on a different blog - pretty reasonable in the world of\ndiscussion based blogs.\n\nMoveableType definitely wants trackback to become more than just blog\ncross-linking. They are also addressing some security concerns.\n\nPingBack\n----------\nhttp://www.hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback\n&quot;Pingback is a method for web authors to request notification when somebody\nlinks to one of their documents.&quot;\n&quot;The pingback mechanism uses an HTTP header and an HTML or XHTML &lt;link&gt;\nelement for autodiscovery, and uses a single XML-RPC call for notifying the\ntarget site of the link on the source site.&quot;\n\nThis seems more cooler... they provide for an HTTP response header\nX-Pingback, as well as a &lt;link&gt; tag in HTML and XHTML: &lt;link rel=&quot;pingback&quot;\nhref=&quot;http://charlie.example.com/pingback/xmlrpc&quot;&gt;\n\nThey also say &quot;HTTP headers are defined to override link elements when they\ndiffer.&quot; - I wonder if this is wise, given that its easier to change content\nthan response headers. I think this happened with HTTP/HTML &lt;meta\nhttp-equiv&gt; tags.\n\nThey also use XML-RPC instead of pure HTTP.\nmethod: pingback.ping\ndescription: Notifies the server that a link has been added to sourceURI,\npointing to targetURI.\n\n\nIt&#39;s interesting to consider the difference between notifications (that a\nlink was added) and an explicit request (add a link to the &#39;referenced-by&#39;\ncollection). Both need a magic name - either &#39;pingback.ping&#39; (the name of\nthe method) or &#39;referenced-by&#39; (the name of the collection). With a custom\nnamed method, you need another magic name to get a list (apparently not\ndiscussed in the pingback spec). With a named collection, you just use GET\non that same collection.\n\n\n\n"}}
