What he=\r\n means may be best explained by a simple example.\n&gt; \n&gt; Assume we have a res=\r\nource that represents a folder, and by issueing a POST request, I can attac=\r\nh a file. What, however, if that post request wrongly goes to, let&#39;s say, a=\r\nnother document resource instead of our folder, and the document resource a=\r\nlso accepts POST (for some reason)?\n&gt; \n&gt; In a RPC world, the document type =\r\nwould not understand an &quot;addDocument()&quot; call, and consequently return an ex=\r\nception. But what about REST? Of course, the POST&#39;s attributes most likely =\r\nwouldn&#39;t be understood and something like 400 Bad Request returned. But wha=\r\nt if they were understood?\n\nAh, yes, a similar thing happens all the time w=\r\nhen\nflaying frisbee in the park with my dog.  When I throw\nthe frisbee and =\r\nthe dog tries to catch it in his teeth,\neveryone seems to be happy.  Howeve=\r\nr, when the dog tries\nto throw the frisbee and I try to catch it in my teet=\r\nh,\nit just doesn&#39;t seem to work well for either of us.\n\n&gt; So, are there mea=\r\nns or patterns, to achieve (some sort) of type safety?\n\nYes.  A RESTful int=\r\nerface is one where the server provides the links\nor forms that tells the c=\r\nlient what operations to perform where.\nIf you are telling the client to do=\r\n the wrong thing, then the\npattern would be to tell the client to do the ri=\r\nght thing instead.\nGenerally speaking, it works out better that way.\n\n....R=\r\noy\n\n\n"}}
