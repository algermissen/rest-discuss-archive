Said \n&gt; &gt; &gt; differently, how would you call generating uris without \n&gt; &gt; &gt; following a template?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You mean with a template? Hmm. Maybe you are right. My point was \n&gt; &gt; language is important, yet I wasn&#39;t using it. Maybe:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; URL assembly?\n&gt; &gt; URL composition?\n&gt; &gt; URL formation?\n&gt; &gt; URL manufacture?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Let&#39;s do it by examples:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) going from &#39;http://server.com/addressbook/{name}&#39; to \n&gt; &#39;http:// server.com/addressbook/johndoe&#39;\n&gt; 2) going from &#39;http://server.com/addressbook&#39; to \n&gt; &#39;http://server.com/ addressbook/johndoe&#39;\n&gt; \n&gt; #1 follows a template to create a new uri\n&gt; #2 assumes implicit knowledge to create new uri\n&gt; \n&gt; I believe everybody (including myself) like #1, b/c the \n&gt; template can change at anytime and the client can create the \n&gt; correct new uris by following a new template.  The template \n&gt; is assumed to be obtained by message exchange, of course, and \n&gt; not somethign hard-coded on the client (otherwise, it would \n&gt; be the same as #2).  #2, on the other hand, is loathed universally.\n&gt; \n&gt; For #1, I like &#39;uri composition&#39; since it&#39;s the composition \n&gt; of a template and data.  Said differently, but with the same \n&gt; intent, composition of partial knowledge to achieve full knowledge.\n&gt; \n&gt; For #2, I consider &#39;uri creation&#39; more appropriate.  It reminds me of\n&gt; creationism: from nothing to something through divine intervention.\n\nOkay, awesome!\n\nSo here are two proposals for the adoption of terminology to clarify this\nissue moving forward.  \n\n#1:\n\n\tA.) URL Composition - The process of using hypermedia and templates\nfor URLs to construct URLs for resources.\n\tB.) URL Creation - The process of constructing URLs based upon\nobservation, pattern recognition, guessing, or other non-hypermedia based\nprocess.\n\tC.) URL Construction - The unspecified process of assembling URLs\neither by URL composition or URL creation.\n\n#2, an alternate, which maintains the meaning for URL Construction that many\npeople assumed could be:\n\n\tA.) URL Composition - The process of using hypermedia and templates\nfor URLs to assemble URLs for resources.\n\tB.) URL Construction - The process of assembling URLs based upon\nobservation, pattern recognition, guessing, or other non-hypermedia based\nprocess.\n\tC.) URL Assembly - The unspecified process of determining URLs\neither by URL composition or URL creation.\n \nAre either of these acceptable, and if so, which would be preferred?  And if\nnot, why not and do you have an alternate proposal?\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org - http://t.oolicio.us\n\nP.S. Note that above I use the name &quot;URL&quot; instead of &quot;URI&quot; but URI could be\nused above in place of URL.  I know that most people on the W3C and related\nlists prefer the term URI even though I strongly prefer the term URL because\nit implies that an identifier must be locatable and not just an identifier\nas used in context of XML namespaces. I know that TimBL prefers URL, which\nis I assume why the W3C prefers it, but I have had discussions with Dan\nConnolly who has admitted he preferred URLs for the same reason as I but\nchose not to fight that batter. That is why you see me always use the term\nURL instead of URI.  As an aside, I don&#39;t see much value in URNs (some, but\nnot much) for essentially the same reason.\n\nP.P.S. For the record, I agree that implementing &quot;A&quot; is the best practice\nfor anything to be processed by a user agent but believe that optimizing for\n&quot;B&quot; is actually a best practice when the &quot;client&quot; is actually a human.\n\n\n"}}
