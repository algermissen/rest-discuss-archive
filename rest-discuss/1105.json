(Unless you were searching for its URI.)\n\n&gt; &gt; Nor do I understand &quot;services/availability/?product=&quot;\n&gt; &gt; vs &quot;products/blueshoes/availability&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What am I missing?\n&gt; \n&gt; The difference is not major.  To the underlying components (HTTP\n&gt; servers, caches, etc) they are identical.  The difference comes if \nyou\n&gt; want to be able to generate these URIs and you want to use URIs for \nthe\n&gt; name of the product.  Then the first one works.\n\nRe &quot;name of the product&quot;:\nThe &quot;products/blueshoes&quot; URI *is* the Web resource identifier of the \nproduct. I don&#39;t understand how &quot;services&quot; is a better name for a \nproduct.\n\nRe availability syntax:\nEither way I have to get either a full URI or a partial URI from \nsomewhere: sent in a message or found by query or navigation.\n\nIn your &quot;services/availability/?product=&quot; notation, I needed to know \nnot only that syntax plus the URI of the product.\n\nIf I have the URI of the product, I can ask it for its business \nprotocols which could be expressed in some as-yet-to-be-defined \nbusiness protocol representation, related to Paul&#39;s WRDL.\nIf I want to find &quot;services/availability&quot;, I would need to do \nsomething similar.\n\nIn other words, I don&#39;t see any big technical advantage to \nthe &quot;services/availability/?product=&quot; notation.\nAnd semantically it seems like a Web service, not a resource.\n\nBut I am pretty sure that the product will have its own URI, \nand &quot;availability&quot; is a natural property (thus sub-resource) of a \nproduct.\n\nSo semantically I like it better.  I think it will be a better way to \ncompose relationships between resources.\n\n\n"}}
