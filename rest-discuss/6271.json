This name for  Web Services based on REST\nprinciples is long overdue.\n\nPeople need names to hang their ideas on and this name is as good as any.\nThe reason someone else has coined it is because we failed to come up with\na suitable\none ourselves. There have been some attempts but none have conjured the\nright image\nin the mind the way this one does.\n\n... Kind of like Service Oriented Architecture but closer to the Web.\n\nWe (on the rest-discuss list) are quick to point out that REST is not an\nalternative\nto SOAP, it is an underlying architectural style. A model upon which HTTP\n1.1 was based.\nThis means nothing to most IT people.\n\nIn the 3 years I have been subscribed to the rest-discuss list I have only\nexperienced one other\nIT professional mentioning REST. REST is not as well known as some\nevangelists think it is.\n\nWhen you say &quot;SOA&quot; people automatically think SOAP, RMI. They think of the\nframeworks and\nstyles that grew out of CORBA and RPC. Applications based on the principles\nof REST are\nfundamentally different from these. There needs to be a discriminator that\nidentifies that\nsubset of SOA applications that conform to REST.\n\nAs an example of how powerful a name can be, apparently there have been\nframeworks around\nfor years that allow you to write rich clients in a web browser but I never\nheard of them until\nsomeone said &quot;AJAX&quot;.\n\nRegards\nDonald.\n\n\nNational Australia Bank Ltd - ABN 12 004 044 937\nThis email may contain confidential information.
