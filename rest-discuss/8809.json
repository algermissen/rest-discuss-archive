RPC communication is stateful, in my case, &quot;each request from \nclient to server... contain(s) all of the information necessary to \nunderstand the request, and (does not) take advantage of any stored context \non the server&quot; which is a stateless, RESTful interaction.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;wouldn&#39;t something like\n&gt;http://en.ericjbowman.com/date/2007-05-25.iso/LongFormat.html\n&gt;be more RESTful.\n&gt;\n\nNot really, URI design is only orthogonal to REST.  My way is not the only \nway.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;http://en.ericjbowman.com/date/2007-05-25.iso/\n&gt;would return links to each of the different formats which can be\n&gt;returned by your service.\n&gt;In this way the service is self describing.\n&gt;At the moment someone has to guess what the possible parameters could\n&gt;be, The service would become more useful by becoming more hackable.\n&gt;\n\nWell, that&#39;s another way to do it.  But my way is still self-describing \nbecause there is a service document which clearly lays out the existence \nand usage of parameters for each language the service is available in, no \nguesswork involved.  I&#39;m a bit confused on where self-describing services \nenters into REST, though.\n\nMore usable to whom?  If I want to write an XSLT stylesheet which takes the \nprimary output and transforms it into RFC 1123 format served as text/plain \nthen I just do this after it&#39;s written:\n\ncurl -iT &quot;en.2.xsl&quot; http://ericjbowman.com/date/en.2.xsl\n\nWhich does a PUT.  I get a 201 Created if it&#39;s new, if I&#39;ve overwritten an \nexisting file I get a 204 No Content response.  Now, I can GET this:\n\nhttp://en.ericjbowman.com/date;transform=2?iso=2007-05-25\n\nThat seems pretty usable to me, as the maintainer of the service, since no \nexisting consumers of the service need to be rewritten to accomodate it, no \nnew name must be devised which might not apply in the future, and all I have \nto do (if I even want to) is update my service documents to reflect that the \nEnglish version now has this capability (which doesn&#39;t make sense for any \nother language).\n\nAnyway, in terms of REST constraints, it&#39;s the messages that are to be \nself-descriptive, not the service itself.  Not hierarchical, but still \nhackable:\n\nhttp://en.ericjbowman.com/date?iso=2007-05-25\n\nAlso, not RPC because it&#39;s perfectly cacheable.  Yes, I can set an Etag, \nbut we are waiting for Caucho to add MD5 capability to Resin (in the works) \nso we can set Etag=MD5.  If this were RPC instead of GET the output would \nnot be cacheable at all.  Instead, I&#39;ve optimized GET, which is very RESTful.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
