Totally different problem. Part of the virtue of REST\nis that you assemble systems from logical components. \n\n&gt; Is your assumption that the client keeps a socket\n&gt; open until a connection happens?\n\n??? We&#39;re talking about delivery of *one* message. Of course I expect it\nto keep a socket open if it can. But if it can keep a socket open then\nwhy is it having trouble delivering the message?\n\n&gt; This seems ugly.  I don&#39;t see why you don&#39;t just\n&gt; want to use SMTP which already takes care of these\n&gt; problems.\n\nBecause it doesn&#39;t.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
