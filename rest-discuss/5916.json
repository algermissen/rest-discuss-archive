It results in the problems that were already\ndescribed and quoted by Bill.\n\nAgent-driven negotiation is far more effective, but there was a huge\ndisagreement between myself and the chair of the HTTP working group\nand my original agent-driven design for HTTP/1.1 was effectively\nburied in committee.\n\nTo do negotiation right, the client needs to be aware of all the\nalternatives *and* what it should use as a bookmark.  In HTTP/1.1,\nall we managed to standardize is 300 and Vary.  We needed Alternates\nand Link to make it work.\n\n&gt;&gt; the fact is that different languages do not produce equivalents.\n&gt;&gt; There are hundreds of nuances, colloquialisms, and shared social\n&gt;&gt; norms that simply do not translate.  We encourage resource owners\n&gt;&gt; to only use true content negotiation (without redirects) when the\n&gt;&gt; only difference between formats is mechanical in nature.\n&gt;\n&gt; Are you saying that true content negotiation should only be done for\n&gt; stuff like changing formats (like when you have a base XML and you\n&gt; convert it into PDF, HTML, etc.) and not for languages?\n\nI am saying that all important resources must have URIs.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
