A &quot;person&quot; resource could have \nvarious pieces of information with some pieces being being more \nimportant than others depending on the context.\n\nA person is at the same time an employee (maybe of multiple \norganizations), a family member, an individual, an author, etc.  Each \none of these aspects of the person would certainly emphasize different \nattributes.  For example,\n\t/person/35 -- could be a general overview of the person whose id in \nthe system is 35\n\t/organization/2/employee/2 -- could be a description of what the \nperson does at company 2\n\t/organization/97/employee/430 -- same person, but at the other company\n\t/family/7/member/3 -- could be how they fit into family #7\n\t/author/120 -- could be the same person, but related to their \nactivities as an author\n\t/person/35/as_author_of/publication/3406 -- same as above?\n\t/person/35/as_employee_of/organization/2\n\t/person/35/as_family_member_of/family/7 -- redundant information URI&#39;s\n\nIs this a crazy way to think about designing a set of URI&#39;s that \ndescribe a set of entities and having different bits of information \ndepending on the context you&#39;re coming from?\n\nThanks,\nTracy\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
