If so, do developers like you and I\n&gt; go to some central IANA site and try to find a media-type via some\n&gt; description, and if found, we find out how to use that service that\n&gt; provides the API? I am not quite understanding what the benefit is of\n&gt; centrally registered media-types.  If I find something useful, do I\n&gt; now have my business depend on this service API hoping it never goes\n&gt; down, can handle my volume of requests, and so forth? Or do I contact\n&gt; the owner of the service and find out how I can make use of it in my\n&gt; own deployments?\n\nAs far as I understand, the media type is not about a particular API or\n(worse) an API provider. Instead, it describes how information is\nrepresented and what certain parts of the content actually mean.\n\nFor example, in the text/html type, it is clearly described what &lt;a\nhref=&quot;...&quot;&gt; means. Everyone who has read the specs for text/html now\nknows this and knows what to do with something like &lt;a&gt;, if it comes as\npart of a message with the text/html media type.\n\nThere is no provider or service that&#39;s tied to that media type\ndefinition. The media type (once documented and ideally registered)\nlives entirely on its own, independent of any provider or particular\nAPI.\n\nJuergen \n\n\n-- \nJuergen Brendel\nMuleSoft\n\n\n"}}
