First, let me say that I\ndon&#39;t think neithe=\r\nr me nor Eric crossed any line here. He just said\nhe&#39;ll ignore my questions=\r\n and I said ok, just do it, don&#39;t need to\npublicize that. He could very eas=\r\nilly said that in a mail to me\ninstead of to the list, since it&#39;s such a pe=\r\nrsonal statement.\n\nNow let me say to make it clear that I do have respect f=\r\nor Eric, and I\nsaid before that I think it is stimulating to debate with hi=\r\nm. I do\nthink that he think too much of himself and has a big ego, but that=\r\n&#39;s\nnot a problem, everibody including me has his or her own particular\npers=\r\nonality with good things or bad things.\n\nBut the fact that I respect him do=\r\nesen&#39;t mean I think he is some kind\nof authoritative source whose opinions =\r\nhave to be taken &quot;prima facie&quot;.\nI think is opinions, like probably the ones=\r\n of everibody else,\nsometime are rigth, sometimes are arguable, and sometim=\r\nes are wrong.\nNow I&#39;m guilty of not jumping into discussions when I think h=\r\ne is\nrigth, just to tell that. But I do it when I think (let&#39;me say again\nt=\r\nhe *I think* part) he is wrong, because or he is indeed wrong and\nthat prev=\r\nents other people of being misguided by his opinions (as it\nhappened to me,=\r\n altougth I gladly admit the contrary is more frequent)\nor is I that I&#39;m wr=\r\nong and is a good opportunity for me to stand\ncorrected.\n\nThat is the way I=\r\n see learning in lists of professional people that\nsee themselves as pairs.=\r\n The simple fact of soemone subscribing to\nthis list is a signal of some kn=\r\nowledge in IT and intention to learn,\nno one here was forced to subscribe o=\r\nr forced to learn REST. This is\nwhat is called dialectic, is how I&#39;ve learn=\r\ned things during my\nprofessional life - after I had a &quot;formal&quot; teacher-stud=\r\nent course that\nI took *before* I&#39;ve becoming a professional.\n\nI think Eric=\r\n has a different approach, he seems to follow that more\n&quot;formal&quot; teacher-st=\r\nudent approach - and that is probably why we tend\nto crash in our discussio=\r\nns. Because I have nothing to learn that way,\nbut probably much to learn ot=\r\nherwise. If I ask a question I kinda\nexpect a response - but Eric thinks I&#39;=\r\nm just asking for the sake of\nasking, or to annoy him. It&#39;s not the case. M=\r\ny fault here?\n\nIn this thread, I said that *in my opinion* - as I carefully=\r\n said\nseveral times - Eric&#39;s aproach was wrong. I quoted Roy to that\npurpos=\r\ne. I then explain my POV in my own words. I then presented a\ndiferent appro=\r\nach, and specifically asked why he thougth his was more\nsimple than the one=\r\n I presented. How can this be considered as\nbitching? What the heck am I&#39;m =\r\nsupposed to do? At least Jan agreed\nwith my POV and I don&#39;t see Eric bashin=\r\n him because of that. And the\nfact tha Jan agreed with me, means I&#39;m not co=\r\nmpletly out of order with\nmy thinking - and Jan is even one of the persons =\r\nwhose opinions I most\nadmire in this list.\n\nI have no problem with Eric ign=\r\noring me, no problem at all, I just\nthink is intelectually wrong if Eric an=\r\nswers some questions - picked\nby him - and ignore others where I&#39;m trying t=\r\no make my point. I wish\nhe takes the &quot;all-or-nothing&quot; approach. Answer all =\r\nor answer none.\n\nNeverthless I wasn&#39;t even considering this a &quot;flame war&quot;, =\r\nso I hope it\nwon&#39;t turn into one.\n\n\n\n\nOn 6 August 2010 08:13, Eric J.
