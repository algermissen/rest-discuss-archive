That requires an\nanalysis of how your API will be used by different types of users.  It&#39;s not\nabout too many options, it&#39;s making sure that the &quot;reasonable possibilities&quot;\nexist based on the different needs of the likely users of your system.\n There are tried and true methods that Website &quot;information architects&quot; use\nin order to envision how the human users of the website will likely want to\ninteract with the system.\n\nREST developers don&#39;t have those &quot;tried and true methods&quot; yet.  Sure, there\nare distinct differences between REST APIs and websites.  However, websites\nare the most RESTful systems that we&#39;re aware of.\n\nI suggested &quot;information architecture&quot; because while it does have plenty of\naesthetic related concerns, it also deals with &quot;the structural design of\nshared information environments&quot; and &quot;practice focused on bringing\nprinciples of design and architecture to the digital landscape&quot; (\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_architecture).  Those seem to fit\nthe needs of REST APIs.\n\nYou can build a better API (Application Programming Interface) if you better\nunderstood how the programmers want to use it. You&#39;re API will likely suffer\nif you don&#39;t take those kind of aspects into consideration.\n\nEven though I&#39;ve thought about approaching RESTful design from this\nperspective for quite a while, I still have very few practical &quot;best\npractices&quot; from other REST APIs to fall back on.  I&#39;m sure you can even\nthink of additional &quot;possible links&quot; in Kenai... For example, what would a\nuser want to do after &quot;Requests to VNet Resources?&quot;\nhttp://kenai.com/projects/suncloudapis/pages/CloudAPIVNetRequests - I assume\nthat there are things that can be done next...\n\nRe: pretty URLs.  No, that wasn&#39;t my point.  However, while the client\napplications shouldn&#39;t necessarily care about interpreting the meaning of\nthe URL, the programmer of that application might care...\n\n-Solomon\nOn Thu, Jun 25, 2009 at 9:40 PM, Craig McClanahan &lt;craigmcc@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt; On Thu, Jun 25, 2009 at 6:24 PM, Solomon Duskis &lt;sduskis@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ergo: REST APIs should be designed similar to the way Websites are...\n&gt; (including\n&gt; &gt; perhaps &quot;Information Architecture&quot;)\n&gt;\n&gt; Hmm ...

Clients of properly designed web services\n&gt; (i.e. those that care about the HATEOAS constraint) will not try to\n&gt; interpret the &quot;meaning&quot; of a URL ... they will just follow it if it does\n&gt; what they need.
