Obviously, a\n&gt; RESTful system should not require a MOVE verb, and the\n&gt; operation can be carried out as follows (assume that the\n&gt; representation already exists):\n\nCan be, but server will lose information about the identity (think \nversion history), and of course it&#39;s not efficient for large resources. \nWhy not use MOVE?\n\n&gt; --&gt;\n&gt; GET /foo.txt\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;--\n&gt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n&gt; ETag: &quot;hash&quot;\n&gt; Content-Type: text/plain\n&gt; Content-Length: 16\n&gt; \n&gt; this is the body\n&gt; \n&gt; --&gt;\n&gt; PUT /bar.txt\n&gt; If-None-Match: *\n&gt; Content-Type: text/plain\n&gt; Content-Length: 16\n&gt; \n&gt; this is the body\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;--\n&gt; HTTP/1.1 201 Created\n&gt; \n&gt; --&gt;\n&gt; DELETE /foo.txt\n&gt; If-Match: &quot;hash&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;--\n&gt; HTTP/1.1 204 No Content\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s fine. The question I am wrestling with at the moment is &quot;how\n&gt; does the client tell the server to redirect requests from /foo.txt\n&gt; to /bar.txt (either temporarily or permanently) ?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I had a look into the Atom Publishing Protocol to see if this is a\n&gt; matter that they have thought about, but I can&#39;t find any reference.\n&gt; \n&gt; I had feedback that you might use the Location header - but I don&#39;t\n&gt; much like the feel of that as it is a response header.\n&gt; \n&gt; Where my thinking is right now is that the server could support a PUT\n&gt; of Content-Type message/http, in the following manner:\n&gt; \n&gt; --&gt;\n&gt; PUT /foo.txt\n&gt; Content-Type: message/http\n&gt; Content-Length: 49\n&gt; \n&gt; HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently\n&gt; Location: /bar.txt\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;--\n&gt; HTTP/1.1 201 Created\n&gt; \n&gt; --&gt;\n&gt; GET /foo.txt\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;--\n&gt; HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently\n&gt; Location: /bar.txt\n&gt; \n&gt; What do you think?\n\n&lt;http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc4437.html#METHOD_MKREDIRECTREF&gt;.\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n"}}
