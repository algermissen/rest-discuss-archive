The focus on HTTP doesn&#39;t\nbother me, but if it bothers other subscribers, perhaps the time has\ncome for a separate mailing list about HTTP implementation. The new\nmailing list could allow for tangential subject matter. (The mailing\nlist of the revived HTTP Working Group [see\n&lt;http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/&gt;] has a specific\nfocus and would not be appropriate.) An alternative to creating a new\nmailing list is to admit that most of us, most of the time, are not\ninterested in discussing the Representational State Transfer per se.\n\nHow opine you all?\n\n-- \nEtan Wexler.\n\n\n"}}
