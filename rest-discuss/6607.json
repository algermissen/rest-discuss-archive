A generic browser with sufficient knowledge of standard\n&gt; verbs\n&gt; &gt; and content types should be able to access and interact with your\n&gt; &gt; RESTful service. Special-purpose clients can still be written, but\n&gt; they\n&gt; &gt; should never be required.\n&gt; Would that that were true. Fact is, most (all?) existing web browsers \n&gt; implement only about half of what&#39;s necessary for a full REST \n&gt; implementation: GET and POST but not PUT and DELETE. HTML forms and \n&gt; XForms 1.0 don&#39;t even allow PUT and DELETE as actions. :-(\n\nWeb browsers don&#39;t support the minimum methods[1] because the forms\nstandards don&#39;t permit them to. This is a fault of the forms standards\nthat needs to be rectified, but is something of nuisance issue in\ndiscussing this case.\n\nThe important thing is that you shouldn&#39;t be defining new content types\nfor your new application, going no further, and thinking you are being\ncompletely RESTful. You are on your way, but there are still steps to\ntake. Maybe someone else will take them for you by adopting your\nstandard and spreading it. However, if the number of content types in\nthe world was directly proportional to the number of applications in the\nworld we would be no closer to a RESTful world-wide architecture.\n\nThe power of the web is that we agree on common content types as well as\ncommon methods. This agreement permits us to use a single family of web\nbrowsers to access a range of websites across a range of industries. In\nfact, a *huge* range of websites across a *huge* range of industries.\nHTML is so flexible it affords humans unprecedented access to data\nthough a small set of technology.\n\nHumans have minds that are able to interpret data written in natural\nlanguage, and often have other equipment that allows them to interpret\nimages and other content. Machines of the present day are not so\nfortunate. The end goal of content type definition in REST is to define\ncontent types to convey to a machine all of the semantics along with our\ninformation a machine might want to act upon. In other circles this has\nbeen tied to RDF and called the semantic web. RDF remains an unproven\ntechnology for the transfer of information, but XML with a\nhuman-readable specification and registered content type combined with\nREST provides a known basis for building a semantic web[2].\n\nIf existing standards are too complex they should not be used. If no\nuseful standards can be found, inventing your own is the right thing to\ndo and should not be discouraged. However, if your web site is the only\none that produces content of a particular type you have not yet in my\nopinion achieved a RESTful outcome. Ideally, all other sites that\npublish similar information should do it using the same content type as\nyou are using. This gives a client with reasonable knowledge of common\ncontent types to access diffent sites owned by different entities, and\nstill be able to interact with them.\n\nI personally think the microformatters are right in their focus on\nidentity, time and date, and location. These are universal concepts that\ncan be applied across the world. I think that when asked, any\nRESTafarian should be able to respond with the standard content type\nthat should be used to convey such information. The fact that we can&#39;t\nsuggests to me that we need more organisation on the content-type front.\nI think we also need to be able to point to a particular place or\ncommunity that supports the standardisation of new content types along\nthe lines of the microformat community.\n\n&gt; Of course, this all presupposes that you&#39;re sitting on top of HTTP. \n&gt; There are RESTful systems that use other, non-HTTP protocols though \n&gt; they&#39;re uncommon in practice. REST is an architecture. It is not\n&gt; limited \n&gt; to HTTP, though I&#39;ve personally never found a need to use any other \n&gt; protocol for a REST system.\n\nI am only just starting to use HTTP in the RESTful migration I have been\nperforming on the software I work with professionally. The whole system\nhas used proprietary protocols in the past and large software bases\nrequire small and careful steps to be taken on the way to architectural\nimprovement. My tutorial emerged from experiences in this migration.\n\nI have integrated support for accessing HTTP services in the latest\nrelease, and have included HTTP server software that is presently\nunused. The migration to real HTTP should have been achieved in a couple\nof releases time.\n\nBenjamin.\n[1] http://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?MinimumMethods\n[2] http://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?ContentTypeAsOntology\n[3] http://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?BenjaminsRESTTutorial\n\n\n"}}
