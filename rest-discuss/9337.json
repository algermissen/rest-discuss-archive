However, I\n&gt; quite like the fact that PUT is intended to be idempotent. I\n&gt; believe the fact that a request is guaranteed to be idempotent\n&gt; is more important than &quot;the URI in a PUT request identifies the\n&gt; entity enclosed with the request&quot; when designing distributed\n&gt; systems.\n&gt; Obviously, the use of POST in this system may be idempotent,\n&gt; but it appears to me that it&#39;s a constraint that deserves to be\n&gt; given more importance, by using PUT. (By the way, to refer to\n&gt; last week&#39;s thread, my understanding of POST not being\n&gt; idempotent is that N+1 times the same request may or may not\n&gt; have the same effect as just one.)\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not sure which one is right between PUT and POST (in both cases), \n&gt; although I tend to think at least the &#39;tentative&#39; PUT ought to be a \n&gt; POST. Any comments appreciated.\n\nSee http://bitworking.org/news/201/RESTify-DayTrader\n\nShort answer: the client POSTs a request, upon which the server\ncreates a ticket of the form\n\n    {$uuid}:{sha1(concat($uuid,$some_secret))}\n\nThe response contains this ticket in the Location of the form\n\n    http://example.org/Item/{$ticket}\n\nwhich the client is expected to PUT to.\n\nValidating such a ticket relies on knowing the secret only, so\nthe server can do it without the necessity for any per-ticket\nstorage.\n\nYou could use GET with this scheme if you really wanted to make\nthe first request idempotent, but then Iâ€™d worry about broken\nintermediaries that might cache the response despite any number\nof headers to the contrary. POST provides an easy reliable way\nto pierce caches.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
