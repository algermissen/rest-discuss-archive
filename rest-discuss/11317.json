IMO, when all else is done right, the differences  \nare syntactic.\n\nOne practice I have observed is that, when the latter approach is in  \nuse, there is a temptation to overdo query parameters and avoid  \nfocusing on modeling resources. For instance, you could overload the  \nsame &quot;/movies&quot; and implement all movie related use cases via query  \nparameters. In doing so, operation names could creep into URIs. For  \ninstance, &quot;/movies?genre=dramas&tile=Godfather&op=edit&quot;, which  \nbypasses the uniform interface. In that sense, this could become a  \nslippery slope. Consequently, in those cases where URIs need to be  \ncreated manually by client developers, they will have a hard time to  \ndetermine what the resource model is.\n\nSecondly, due to historical conventions, some consider query  \nparameters as optional parameters and say that a request to the URI  \nshould continue to serve something even if all or some query  \nparameters are omitted from the URI. This is not dictated by any  \nstandard, but it follows from how query parameters are used in popular  \nusages on the web such as search.\n\nThirdly, due to some historic reasons, when query params are used on  \nURIs, caches may ignore the caching response headers and not cache  \nresponses.\n\nGiven this, I suggest the former approach, and reserve query  \nparameters to cases where they are most needed. Examples include agent- \ndriven negotiation (e.g. when you want to take a query parameter with  \na shortname for a media type, such as &quot;?format=atom&quot;),  paginating a  \ncollection of movie resources (as in &quot;?start=10&count=10&quot;) etc.\n\nSubbu\n\n"}}
