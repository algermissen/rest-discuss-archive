You got a case where such a form is open to CSRF? I thought  \n&gt; the\n&gt; definition of CSRF was that scripting was involved.\n\nCRSF can be done via anything that can submit a request to a server,  \nand hence includes images, script/css links as well. Scripting is not  \nnecessary.\n\nThe key point is that, irrespective of whether the target site is XHR  \nor not, all HTTP requests need to be validated using URIs can that can  \nnot generated by arbitrary sites, as Daniel was explaining in his  \nresponse.\n\nSubbu\n\n"}}
