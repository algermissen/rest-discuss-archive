When we POST a new purchase order we expect resources that=\r\n\n&gt; describe the set of open purchase orders to change. This information is\n=\r\n&gt; accessible from multiple resources, and could conceivably be modified\n&gt; u=\r\nsring one of several resources. We can talk about resource that share\n&gt; inf=\r\normation as overlapping. Changes that might not be a simple overlap\n&gt; may i=\r\nnclude a commission being paid for the puchase order achieving a\n&gt; particul=\r\nar state of completion. Any kind of business logic may be\n&gt; performed by th=\r\ne server so long as it provides a reasonable\n&gt; interpretation of the reques=\r\nt to modify a particular resource. Even a\n&gt; GET is likely to have sort of s=\r\nide-effect. A log file is bound to be\n&gt; updated, at least.\n&gt; \n&gt; Benjamin.\n&gt;=\r\n\n\nSo here&#39;s a question:\nWhat about PUT? When you PUT something can other re=\r\nsources change? If\nso are those changes also required to be idempotent? Doe=\r\ns that mean\nthat a resource that is a counter for the number of times anoth=\r\ner\nresource was PUT is &quot;illegal&quot;?\n\nAlso, I assume that side-effects of GET =\r\n(as well as the non-idempotent\nside-effects of PUT and DELETE) are only all=\r\nowed as long as they are\nnot reflected in the resource space in any way? e.=\r\ng. you should never\nmake the log part of your interface, accessible via GET=\r\n. Correct?\n(Note that I&#39;m not implying that if for some reason you provided=\r\n some\nHTTP access to your log file for administrators that all is lost.\nArg=\r\nuably this is a different interface.)\n\n\n\n"}}
