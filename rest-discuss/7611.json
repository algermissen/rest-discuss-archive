You can encapsulate the non-RESTful system\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; a RESTful container. Just don&#39;t expect it to be a 1:1 mapping. If\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; inside is not RESTful and the outside is RESTful, it will be n:m.\n&gt; This feels like over-engineering. It&#39;s not because something can be\n&gt; mapped to concept X that it should be. Otherwise, why would we ever\n&gt; have left the realm of Turing machines.\n...\n&gt; Modeling certain operations as RPC has its place, imho. That&#39;s why I\n&gt; defined the Behavior pattern in &#39;REST for the rest of us&#39; [1]\n&gt; (although, I&#39;m thinking about renaming it to something less abstract).\n&gt; Like anything else, it should be used only when required, but when it\n&gt; is required, it shouldn&#39;t be shunned.\n\nI would be inclined to call this an antipattern. I think it should be\navoided. Mapping arbitrary method invocation into POST doesn&#39;t help web\nbrowsers or other generic network components interact with the resource.\nIt is more of a back-door for when you don&#39;t really want to do REST for\nwhatever reason... and there may well be reasons. However, I would be\ninclined to look to adding special request methods rather than hiding\nthem in the body of a POST request or in a url. If you are using RPC\ninstead of REST style, you might as well put your method where the\nprotocol says it should go.\n\nDo you have any examples of this pattern being applied that do not\ncleanly map into standard HTTP methods?\n\nBenjamin.\n\n\n"}}
