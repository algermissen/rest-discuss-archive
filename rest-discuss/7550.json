I can tell you are in sales.\n\nWhy the ad-hominem response?  \n\nAnyway, we are all in sales. Parents sell their children on eating\nvegetables, scientists sell sponsors on funding their research and\ncolleagues on supporting their findings, standards participants on agreeing\ntheir to positions on a proposed standard, job interviewees on themselves,\netc. Anyone who doesn&#39;t believe there are in sales are just fooling\nthemselves and are most likely less effective then they could otherwise be.\n\nThat said, &quot;Have I every really been in sales?&quot;  Well, I&#39;ve never held a job\nwith the word &quot;sales&quot; in the title. I&#39;ve never received a paycheck that\nincluded any sales commissions. But have a ever sold something that a\ncompany I was running needed me to sell?  Absolutely.\n\n&gt; 2. You make assumptions I don&#39;t: have you heard of cut and paste?\n\nActually, your assumptions are broader than mine; you are assuming there is\nonly one use-case when there are many. See my reply to Jon Hanna [1] with\nspecifics of the use case I was describing.\n\n&gt; : If I&#39;m at a party and someone asked me about some pictures \n&gt; I took, I can\n&gt; : just tell them to go to:\n&gt; :\n&gt; : http://www.flickr.com/photos/mikeschinkel\n&gt; :\n&gt; \n&gt; I guess if they can remember that, several hours and several \n&gt; beers later, then they can probably also remember your name.  \n&gt; That&#39;s better than I can do.\n\nNot at all. All they need to do is be able to read my writing on the back of\nmy business card. But that&#39;s only because Flickr has a URL that I can\nremember; if it didn&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t have been able to remember it in order to\nwrite in on the back of my business card.\n\nBTW, this is not hypothetical; I have given out this URL when I&#39;ve told\nfriends that I had pictures they were interested in.\n\n&gt; Typically, I email or IM links to people.  As far as typing \n&gt; into the location bar of the browser, I avoid it like the plague.\n\nUnfortunately, most of the web-using world&#39;s population isn&#39;t tethered 100%\nof the time to a machine capable of sending email.\n\n&gt; : I share an appreciation for motorcycles with my dad.  \n&gt; : I like to send him links in email. Let&#39;s assume the link \n&gt; : breaks. Which one is he likely to be able to fix? (and \n&gt; : which one is least likely to break?)\n&gt; \n&gt; Breaks?  You mean line breaks?  Yes, I agree with \n&gt; *short* URI in principle.\n\nYes, sorry for my typo.\n\n&gt; : But if they were this instead this, it would be much \n&gt; : easier for dad to identify and fix those broken links \n&gt; : (and much less likely they&#39;d break):\n&gt; \n&gt; I feel bad for your dad \n\nDon&#39;t be, he is happy that his son shares one of his interests and that his\nson communicates with him so often. Many fathers could only wish for the\nsame.\n\n&gt; in this case, and if I were he, I&#39;d  stick to fixing \n&gt; motorcycles, because it would entail much \n&gt; less futile typing.\n\nThat&#39;s a rather arrogant response, and is not appreciated.\n\n&gt; Honestly, Mike, show your dad how to cut and paste broken (line\n&gt; wrapped) URI back together.  \n\nI have shown him. But I can&#39;t show the untold millions of other people&#39;s\nfathers, or mothers, how to do the same. \n\n&gt; : Now, let&#39;s say that I wanted to send him a link to look at the 50th\n&gt; : Anniversary Sportster. See the link below? Tell me what I \n&gt; should send him.\n&gt; : Go head. Open it up. And tell me what link.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m afraid....\n\nAs you should have been. :-)\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n&quot;It never ceases to amaze how many people will proactively debate away\nattempts to make the web more usable...&quot;\n\n[1] http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/7549\n\n\n"}}
