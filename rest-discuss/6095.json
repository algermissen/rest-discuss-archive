The request is \n&gt;&gt; a resource. The URI of =\r\nthis new resource may be\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   sensorDownloadOperation/sensorId/requestId=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The following verbs on these may be supported:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   GET returns t=\r\nhe request status: in progress, cancelled, completed, \n&gt;&gt; result code\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n   PUT may be used to modify the executing request: change the status to \n&gt;=\r\n&gt; cancel.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   DELETE would delete old requests not required anymore.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; I am not sure if this is &quot;tir.=C3=A9 par les cheveux&quot; (hum... &quot;pulled b=\r\ny the \n&gt;&gt; hair&quot;, a common expression in French Canadian ;), i.e. I do not k=\r\nnow if \n&gt;&gt; this is extending REST / HTTP in an area that it should not belo=\r\nng to. \n&gt;&gt; But it makes issuing download requests very easy for the client.=\r\n..\n&gt;&gt;   \n&gt; That&#39;s a neat application, and it definitely sounds RESTful.  Ho=\r\nwever I \n&gt; should point out that you&#39;re treating the &quot;sensor download opera=\r\ntion&quot; as \n&gt; data, rather than a verb. \n\nBut that&#39;s correct in REST terms. T=\r\nhe only verbs are the HTTP verbs.\n\n\n&gt; You&#39;re using the Command pattern, in =\r\nGoF \n&gt; speak.  This is a valid design choice and is entirely appropriate, w=\r\nhen \n&gt; the message is something you need to &quot;monitor the status of&quot;.  You d=\r\non&#39;t \n&gt; &quot;monitor the status&quot; of a GET request by GETting another resource. =\r\n What \n&gt; you&#39;re doing is not unlike SOAP - where an HTTP POST is used to pa=\r\nckage \n&gt; up another message.  It&#39;s like you&#39;re using REST when you can, but=\r\n not \n&gt; using it where it doesn&#39;t fit.\n\nI don&#39;t understand you.\n\nClaude&#39;s s=\r\nystem looks exactly like a RESTful transaction API:\n\n   POST /someplace\n   =\r\n=3D&gt; /someplace/resourcexx\n\n   GET /someplace/resourcexx\n   =3D&gt; state of r=\r\nesourcexx\n\n   PUT /someplace/resourcexx\n   =3D&gt; altered state of resourcexx=\r\n\n\n\nWhy is it not RESTful?\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
