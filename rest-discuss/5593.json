Just a naming issues anyhow.\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The problem was that there was a closed world assumption being made\n&gt; there by sharing indexedBy between two incompatible uses.  i.e.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;http://example.org/query&gt; rf:indexedBy some:param\n&gt;\n&gt; by itself, is ambiguous because you don&#39;t know the rdf:type of the\n&gt; subject.  Keeping indexedBy for URI-parameterization addresses that\n&gt; ambiguity.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; What is the reason for adding rf:From and rf:method? Do they add\n&gt;&gt; capabilities not possible with Container, Indexable or Settable (are\n&gt;&gt; they intended to provide generic support for other methods, such as\n&gt;&gt; DELETE or WATCH)?\n&gt;\n&gt; Yup, exactly.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Now that you have removed the intent related parts, the genericity of\n&gt;&gt; POST is becoming very clear (all you know about the resource that you\n&gt;&gt; send your data to is that it supports POST accepts certain media\n&gt;&gt; types. The shoe order example from the last version made it quite\n&gt;&gt; easy (at least for me) to miss the implicit intent aspect.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; OTH...do you still think that the clients should/could base their\n&gt;&gt; choice of container on additional information about known containers\n&gt;&gt; (such as their type)?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If not, what is your idea of how an application should communicate to\n&gt;&gt; a client where to send the show-orders and where to send refund\n&gt;&gt; requests for bad shoes?\n&gt;\n&gt; Hmm, the &quot;intent&quot; stuff was just to permit the client to declare\n&gt; pre-conditions in the message for the processing of the data in that\n&gt; message.  The previous version of the spec associated the rdf:type of\n&gt; the processing resource, as declared via the form, to that\n&gt; information, but it needn&#39;t be the only information the client uses to\n&gt; base its decision upon, nor reflect as a pre-condition in the message.\n&gt;\n&gt; So to answer your question, the application should use different URIs\n&gt; to do those things.\n&gt;\n&gt; Mark.\n&gt; --\n&gt; Mark Baker.
