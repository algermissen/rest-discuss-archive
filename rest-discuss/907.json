So I&#39;m not really into evangelizing REST to them either.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t really have the time to become an ebxml reg/rep expert but I do\n&gt; feel that the ebXML world is a natural ally for the REST world because\n&gt; they seem to be document-centric rather than API and software-centric.\n\nWell, there&#39;s definitely conflicting goals there.  It would not have\nbeen hard for them to decentralize without using REST, but they chose\nnot to.  So I think that there&#39;s forces at work there.\n\nAnd I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s no value to evangelizing it to them.  It&#39;s\njust that there&#39;s only so many hours in a day.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
