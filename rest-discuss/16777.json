This is good, simple, and gets you a long way.\n&gt; \n&gt; But is everything just CRUD? Isn&#39;t that too limiting? What about situations where CRUD isn&#39;t sophisticated enough or just doesn&#39;t fit with what you&#39;re trying to do? I&#39;ve heard that everything that can be expressed in a RESTful URL, but I&#39;m not buying that.\n&gt; \n&gt; Like I said, I do believe in and love REST, and that it covers a LOT of situations. But I don&#39;t think that REST applies to everything.\n&gt; \n&gt; What do other people think?\n\nPersonally I think that there isn&#39;t really a &quot;REST&quot;, and see it more as \na set of constraints and a style which you apply to a situation in order \nto assess how RESTful it is, and then use the constraints to make it \nmore RESTful.\n\nUsually this involves making things that bit simpler and more crud-like, \nand personally I&#39;ve always seen many benefits in doing this.\n\nCertainly, I&#39;ve not found a need for anything beyond the core set of \nHTTP Verbs and a couple from older specs + webdav.\n\nBest,\n\nNathan\n\n"}}
