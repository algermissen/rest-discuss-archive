Allow me to rephrase:\n\nThe REST approach to having a client request the deletion of one or\nmore resources, is for the server to instruct the client, using\nhypermedia, how to call the DELETE method for each of the desired\nURIs.  The case this doesn&#39;t cover, atomic batch-deletion, is a good\nexample use-case for Code on Demand.\n\nMike points out that my phrasing ignored the possibility of URI\ntemplates, JSON etc., or concurrent DELETE requests from clients.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
