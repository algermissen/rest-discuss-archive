The design I have\ncome\n&gt; up with is incredibly simple, flexible, and (i believe) even RESTful (no,\n&gt; really!).  However, before I get too deep into its design, I thought I\nwould\n&gt; look around at what others are doing.  Anyone know of any RESTful (from\nthe\n&gt; ground up, preferably) &quot;mail&quot; systems out there already?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; In the end, my objective is to get a simple, easily visible RESTful\n&gt; application on the web and used by lots of people (the latter part is\n&gt; possibly more important that the former part).  As I have been reading the\n&gt; &quot;visibility&quot; thread, I got to thinking that (other than letting people\n&gt; discover for themselves the pitfalls of RPC) people would be more\nreceptive\n&gt; to REST if they could actually see something RESTful.  I know the Web\nitself\n&gt; is RESTful, but it&#39;s hard to convince someone of the legitimacy of a term\n&gt; that came after the application that demonstrated it.  Coming up with\n&gt; something *new* would, imho, be an easier thing to digest and understand\nto\n&gt; the REST skeptics out there.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To that end, if anyone is interested in working with me on this, I will\n&gt; happily share my thoughts.  I think it&#39;s highly workable, and would\n&gt; certainly be more successful if it were a group effort.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt; seairth@...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
