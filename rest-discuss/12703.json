It seems to have two strengths.\n&gt;&gt;  * It&#39;s a very convenient way of documenting the interface, for  \n&gt;&gt; humans.  Given that someone actually wants to use your service,  \n&gt;&gt; they&#39;ll want to know what &#39;things&#39; are available, and giving   \n&gt;&gt; &quot;HATEOAS&quot; as the answer to every question isn&#39;t going to win you  \n&gt;&gt; friends.  That is, you _do_ need human documentation, and WADL  \n&gt;&gt; provides a reasonable structure for that.\n&gt;\n&gt; An XSD would work just as well, no?  And you&#39;d have one less  \n&gt; document to maintain.\n\nI&#39;m not completely sure what you mean.  There is a document type which  \nthe WADL file conforms to, namely the wadl.rnc of the WADL  \ndistribution, which seems as good a structure as any for documenting  \nan interface like this.\n\nI could just write an HTML page directly, true, but it&#39;s the fact that  \nthe WADL file generates two files, one of which is verified to match  \nthe code&#39;s regression tests, that seems to be the win here.  And if I  \nmake a change to the interface, I&#39;m forced to change the  \nimplementation, and vice versa.\n\nAll the best,\n\nNorman\n\n\n-- \nNorman Gray  :  http://nxg.me.uk\nDept Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester\n\n\n"}}
