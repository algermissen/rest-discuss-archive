If\n&gt; it is defined such it is not related to the expected data structures,\n&gt; hyperlink mechanisms and available relations, than it is indeed\n&gt; orthogonal to a schema. That&#39;s fine with me, sorry for any confusion.\n&gt; \n\nWhat I mean is, you can&#39;t recommend doing this:\n\nContent-Type: application/json;\n                 profile=http://json.com/my-hyper-schema\n\nBecause when I look at the IANA registry, I see that application/json\nmaps to RFC 4627, which only lists one optional parameter, charset.  I\nsee no definition of any profile parameter.  The usage you are\nrecommending is not self-descriptive, because it is not supported by RFC\n4627.\n\nOne possible processing model for XHTML documents is text/plain, another\nis text/html, and another is application/xhtml+xml -- please see RFC\n3236 as an example of how a media type registration is the proper place\nto define such usage.  RFC 3236 doesn&#39;t extend the definition of profile\nto text/html, text/plain, or even application/xml -- this would be out-\nof-scope.\n\nIf a standard comes along which registers application/foo+json, it is\nup to that MIME registration to define the usage of a profile parameter.\nSuch a definition shouldn&#39;t have to worry about conflicting with some\nother use of that syntax being forced on it by an unrelated spec, in\nparticular a schema spec which may have nothing whatever to do with the\nschema (or BNF notation) being used to describe application/foo+json.\n\nThis usage is part of the processing model defined by the media type\nidentifier, it is not appropriate for a schema language to define such\nusage for anything beyond, in this case, application/schema+json --\nyour media type registration for that identifier doesn&#39;t make sense, as\nit doesn&#39;t define &#39;schema&#39; or &#39;schema.items&#39; and omits any mention of\nthe &#39;profile&#39; parameter (again, see RFC 3236).\n\nDon&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m in favor of +json, I&#39;m just giving the same\nfeedback that both schema+json and senml+json have gotten -- the right\nway to do this is to first change RFC 4288, then RFC 4627:\n\nhttp://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ietf-types/current/msg01062.html\n\nOtherwise, I don&#39;t see approval of either I-D until that issue is\nsettled or their associated identifier syntax is changed.  But then\nagain, maybe it will be anyway, I don&#39;t know -- all I  do know is that\nno +json identifier has yet made it into the IANA registry, therefore no\n+json identifier is currently self-descriptive; and that it is not self-\ndescriptive to use a profile parameter in conjunction with any media\ntype identifier unless that identifier defines a profile parameter.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
