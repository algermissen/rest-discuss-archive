I&#39;m glad to see it getting\n&gt; &gt; a high profile airing.\n&gt;\n&gt; Joe,\n&gt;\n&gt; Interesting stuff. Have you thought about generalizing it a bit? I mean, I\n&gt; prefer RSS 1.0 to RSS 2.0, and I think RESTlog would be more useful if you\n&gt; didn&#39;t specify so much about how messages are stored on the server side;\n&gt; both physically and w/r/t to format...\n&gt;\n&gt; It might be nice to make a capability discovery URI, like:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://foo.bar/message-types\n&gt;\n&gt; which one could GET and which would return an XML doc (actually, RDF would\n&gt; be ideal for this) describing which formats the RESTlog could understand and\n&gt; store, among other things.\n&gt;\n&gt; In other words, RESTlog looks neat, but if I were going to use it for\n&gt; projects, I&#39;d want to store messages not in files on the filesystem but in,\n&gt; say, ZODB (or MySQL), and I&#39;d want to have more flexibility in the sorts of\n&gt; message types a client could expect to POST.\n&gt;\n&gt; Kendall\n&gt; --\n&gt; Jazz is only what you are. -- Louis Armstrong\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
