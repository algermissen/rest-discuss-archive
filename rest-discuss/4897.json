And by that, URIs can have associated operations, such as GET,\nPOST, DELETE, etc.\n\nIn contrast, SHARE is actually (IMHO) more neutral in nature. It does not\nimpose restrictions whether you must do a GET or POST or whatever method.\nAll it knows is just a bunch or URIs with associated methods, and some\nsemantics.\n\nIn that view REST is also SHARE. And even SOAP Web Services are also\nSHARE. Well I guess I&#39;m trying to confuse things :-P\n\nOkay let&#39;s just stick to Simple HTTP API via RPC and Encoded data. ;-)\n\n&gt; My argument is that -- from what we&#39;ve seen so far -- either GET _or_\n&gt; POST is being used.  HEAD doesn&#39;t really seem to be used by any of these\n&gt; services.\nYeah... true... Nobody uses HEAD in web scripts. Actually almost everyone\nignores the HTTP request method used.\n\n&gt; In terms of recommendation, it&#39;d have to be the much safer POST\n&gt; operation, not GET.\nYeah I have to agree. Maybe I have to emphasize my &quot;recommendation&quot; was\nabout accessibility. Example if you create an interface that&#39;s going to be\n(hopefully) publicly accepted, designing your interface so it only uses\nPOST methods are really going to affect some accessibility, in common\ncases like someone doesn&#39;t have the appropriate library to perform POST\nrequests or using an old XMLHTTP object.\n\n&gt;&gt; - Has a SHARE Description (SHARED) which basically looks like RSDL I\n&gt;&gt; proposed before.\n&gt; No.  I&#39;m trying to describe the existing world, not prescribe a new one.\n\nI don&#39;t think something such as SHARE Description Language is already\n&quot;existing&quot;. WSDL exists but it&#39;s tailored heavily biased towards RPC/SOAP\nand only recently thoughts on REST-like services are being considered.\nAnd there&#39;s no such thing as SHARE Description Language specification.\nEven the SHARE itself is questionable, WTF is it? Is it in Wikipedia?\n\n&gt; No. The SHARE interfaces we&#39;ve seen so far have been described in prose\n&gt; in HTML as a rule, actually.\n\nTrue. Just like the del.icio.us API. I don&#39;t see that as an &quot;interface\ndescription&quot; but merely as &quot;service description documentation&quot;. IMHO a\ndescription is machine-processable while a documentation is intended for\nhumans to read. And del.icio.us API is not an interface but a service,\nsince it&#39;s not specifying a public interface (maybe in WSDL) that others\ncan use and refer when they want to implement something based on\ndel.icio.us interface.\n\n&gt; No offense, but /please/ don&#39;t co-opt this term as the name of your\n&gt; design for doing RPC via HTTP.  My whole point of coining the term was\n&gt; to describe the *class* of recently-emergant APIs that have adopted the\n&gt; description &quot;REST&quot; without necessarily following its constraints.  I&#39;d\n&gt; really like the term to be a bit more abstract than &quot;it has this\n&gt; [Interface] Description Language, and these encoding rules, and ...&quot;\n&gt; with a spec and a website.\n\nOk, no problem.\n\nThat leads me to some problem..... what&#39;s the name of this &quot;thing&quot;?\n\nAs I use it to develop Gado-gado, I might use something like Gado-gado\nService Description or whatever... but I don&#39;t like it because it&#39;s not\nGado-gado specific.\n\nAnd in that sense I want this &quot;thing&quot; to have a class... I don&#39;t want to\nuse &quot;Web Services&quot; since it&#39;s related tightly with SOAP and XML, and my\nWeb Service isn&#39;t SOAP, it isn&#39;t XML, it is actually REST without strict\nREST semantics and it&#39;s more SHARE but I can&#39;t use the SHARE name. And\neven so I can&#39;t say &quot;this is a SHARE-like service&quot; since nobody knows what\nSHARE is...?\n\nActually from the last few researches I&#39;ve found WSDL 2.0 to be quite\nsuited to describing both SHARE-ish Service Descriptions and SHARE-ish\nInterface Descriptions. So I can just say that Gado-gado is a SHARE-based\nservice that used WSDL formats to describe the service and the interfaces.\n\nBut actually I don&#39;t want to involve Gado-gado so much in this... why?\nBecause I want to promote the *idea* that using SHARE with publicly\navailable (and widely used, i.e. standardized) interfaces is a Good\nThing(tm), and not to promote Gado-gado itself. Promoting Gado-gado is\nuseless since I don&#39;t think anybody cares about it, but I want to\ncommunicate the idea that having &quot;standardized&quot; interfaces is something\ngood. But why SHARE? Why not REST or SOAP? This is basically because of my\npreference of *accessibility*, in that SHARE:\n- does not require a special library to be used\n- uses only simple programmatic functions (GET is trivial, while POST is\nmore difficult but far easier than SOAP)\n- does not require ANY change to the web server configuration\n- usable by ANY browser on the planet, even Lynx!\n\nBTW the idea does not limit anyone to prefer SOAP or REST... It&#39;s\nperfectly legal since SOAP, REST, SHARE, XML RPC, etc. they&#39;re all\nsupported by WSDL (thanks to 2.0... errr maybe the next version, plus\nWS-Transfer and maybe some others). However, it should be emphasized that\nusing a non-SHARE approach greatly limits the accessibility and\nimplementability of the interface, although it may (and will) provide\nbetter semantics, architectural design, ease of use (in case the libraries\nare already there), etc.\n\nMaybe I&#39;ll have to elaborate my point more:\nIn case anyone (if at all) gets interested in developing a service similar\nto Gado-gado, they may develop it and implement the Gado-gado *interface*.\nI don&#39;t want people calling the other site &quot;A Gado-gado clone&quot;, but I want\nthem to say &quot;It&#39;s one of the sites which implements the Gado-gado\ninterface&quot; (though I&#39;d prefer the interface name to be &#39;Social bookmarking\ninterface&#39;). The distinction is important. If Google, Wikipedia, and\nAskJolene were to support the same interface, it&#39;d be good if they just\nsay they implement the same &quot;Searchable&quot; interface, rather than Wikipedia\nand AskJolene claiming to have a Google-compatible API.\n\nBut still my question: Any suggestions on how should I name this &quot;thing&quot;?\n\nHendy Irawan, GaulDong - http://dev.gauldong.net\n\n"}}
