I was aware of OpenID.  It=\r\n looks like\n&gt; OpenID is more suited for a browser interface, where clients =\r\nexpect HTML\n&gt; responses that contain prompts for the user.  For my enterpri=\r\nse usage,\n&gt; where the REST clients aren&#39;t the browser, that means a lot of =\r\nextra\n&gt; &quot;scraping&quot; work for clients, at best.  Am I mis-reading that spec?\n=\r\n\nAh, well OpenID was originally developed for user-centric use-cases, but t=\r\nhere&#39;s no reason that you can&#39;t use it for computer-to-computer scenarios e=\r\nither. It&#39;s just exchanging a bunch of hypermedia documents (XHTML forms) b=\r\netween three parties really. In fact Ian, Savas, and I have developed an ex=\r\nample doing just this for our book (apologies to the list for harping on ab=\r\nout an incomplete book, again).\n\n&gt; Before I rush to suggest that my company=\r\n do a lot of work around oauth,\n&gt; what are the caveats for using it?\n\nNothi=\r\nng, apart from it&#39;s still a bit of a moving target AFAIK. (and at the risk =\r\nof incurring the wrath-of-rest, it&#39;s in our book).\n\nJim\n"}}
