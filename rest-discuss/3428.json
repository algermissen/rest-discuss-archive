I&#39;m surprised I haven&#39;t run into this yet, but in all the\nwork I&#39;ve done with containers, PUT never made sense.  That doesn&#39;t\nmean it can&#39;t though.\n\nI always figured that when I did need to support PUT, I would end up\nusing WebDAV&#39;s 207 (Multi-Status) response.  AFAICT though, there&#39;s no\nprovision for communicating Location header values within the response.\nI wonder if you could shove that in the response, as some XML encoded\nRDF (and not break DAV clients)?\n\n&gt; I&#39;d like to be able \n&gt; to indicate the newly created widget 35 with a 201 Created response, but \n&gt; the response I must return relates to the container, not its contents. \n&gt; Also I&#39;m not too happy with the indirect addressing that seems to be \n&gt; happening here - I have the URI for the box as part of the request, but \n&gt; this request affects other resources, which I can only address inside \n&gt; the message-body itsself, which just seems wrong.\n\nThere&#39;s no problem with that from a REST POV, AFAIK.  Shit happens, so\nto speak. 8-)\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.   Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA.        http://www.markbaker.ca\nWeb architecture consulting, technical reports, evaluation & analysis\n\n"}}
