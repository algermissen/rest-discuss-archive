Cacellation just  \nsets a flag to true in the server.\n\nIf after cancellation the resource is no longer GETable, I think the  \ninterface would be DELETE + 410 Gone afterwards. That sounds right?\n\nBut if cancelled bookings are GETable which interface would you  \nprovide? According to the RFC PUT requests should send the state of  \nobjetcs, but changing this flag to me sounds different than changing  \nregular attributes of the booking as &quot;number of rooms&quot;.\n\nIf the resource was an invoice with a flag paid/unpaid it sounds  \nstrange to require the entire invoice through PUT. I think the  \nsituation is analogous here.\n\nIn general I think I want to know how do you model &quot;state&quot; flags.  \nSometimes they aren&#39;t even setable by the client.\n\n-- fxn\n\n\n"}}
