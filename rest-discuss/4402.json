It&#39;s really hard to follow you. Could you please be a bit more\n&gt;&gt;verbose about why you consider that wrong? It doesn&#39;t need to be a\n&gt;&gt;physical file, ok, but besides that?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I am debugging a problem with PUT.  PUT data on this server never gets to\n&gt; the handler script.  There are many places in the server configuration\n&gt; where the PUT data could be getting blocked, because all the server tools\n&gt; (Apache, PHP, Plesk) treat PUT as an opt-in, because they think it&#39;s about\n&gt; uploading files.  There are plenty of potential sources of the problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; Compare that to GET, which just works.\n\nIf your point is that GET has better support than PUT -- ok, that&#39;s kind \nof obvious. On the other hand, with the Java servlet API I never ever \nhad any problem implementing handlers for PUT, so it&#39;s definitively not \n&quot;fancy&quot; from my point of view. Nor are OPTIONS, PROPFIND, PROPPATCH or \nother new HTTP methods.\n\n&gt; This is not a request for help and it&#39;s not a complaint about Apache, PHP\n&gt; or Plesk.  It&#39;s an example to explain my comment that PUT does not work by\n&gt; default and so has to be considered fancy.\n\nObviously that depends on the environment you&#39;re in.\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n-- \n&lt;green/&gt;bytes GmbH -- http://www.greenbytes.de -- tel:+492512807760\n\n"}}
