These are RDF vocabularies that define constraints on\n&gt; resources and their relationships, rather than doing it on syntax.\n\nAs was pointed out to me on www-ws-desc@..., those two aren&#39;t\nreally comparable.  I have never used DTDs/XML Schemas (all my XML\nhas been RDF for 2+ years), and just failed to recognize that an\nXML Schema constrains the relationship between elements in a document\nscope, not a global scope.\n\nIn RDF/OWL, there&#39;s no way to say &quot;in this document, Person has to\nhave an Age&quot;; there&#39;s only a way to say &quot;People have one age&quot;, which\nsays nothing about what any particular document might say.\n\nOf course, what you find when you switch to RDF is that you don&#39;t\nneed to say &quot;in this document ...&quot;.  Or at least I&#39;ve never had the\nneed, and I&#39;ve done a fair bit of RDF (not much OWL though).  So\nperhaps the answer to your question is &quot;You don&#39;t need to&quot;.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.   Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA.        http://www.markbaker.ca\n\n"}}
