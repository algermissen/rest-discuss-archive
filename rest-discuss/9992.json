With POST/PUT, you are creating/changing  \n&gt;&gt; the resource itself, not just creating/changing a &quot;representation&quot;  \n&gt;&gt; of the resource. Given this, there is reason to offer a symmetry  \n&gt;&gt; between GET and POST/PUT. That is, if a GET is capable of returning  \n&gt;&gt; application/json, application/xml and text/html, it does not imply  \n&gt;&gt; that a POST or PUT should support processing creation/update of the  \n&gt;&gt; resource with the payload expressed via the same media types. You  \n&gt;&gt; may instead decide to support application/x-www-form-urlencoded if  \n&gt;&gt; the clientele is browsers.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t think I understand what you&#39;re trying to say here. I didn&#39;t,  \n&gt; or didn&#39;t mean to, suggest that there should be symmetry between  \n&gt; media types supported for GET and media types supported for POST/ \n&gt; PUT. I simply said that more flexibility is available in the system  \n&gt; if POST/PUT can accept multiple media typed representations, do a  \n&gt; bit of transformation (e.g. html -&gt; text), and create/change  \n&gt; resources in a canonical storage form.\n\nLooks like we are agreeing to the same. For flexibility sake, yes, you  \nmay offer several encoding formats.\n\nSubbu\n\n"}}
