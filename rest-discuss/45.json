A request is a plea from the sender to make something happen \nand if it isn&#39;t possible, let the sender know.\n\nIt interesting to note that a &#39;notify&#39; method isn&#39;t needed. You can \npretty much echo stuff that happens after the subscription to the \nsubscribers. But what do you echo? The follow-on requests or the \nresponses (considering purely HTTP)? Or both? Or do you only echo a \nrequest when a success response occurrs?\n\nFun stuff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
