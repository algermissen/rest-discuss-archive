That (and the =\r\nrest you wrote) makes good sense. But I still feel sorry for the cats that =\r\nget kicked when someone mints a new media type.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Why?\n&gt; \n&gt; Not beca=\r\nuse I am going to kick them, I believe myself to be completely aligned with=\r\n your opinion.\n\nUnderstood - I did mean to add my 2 cents to the discussion=\r\n, not to &#39;correct&#39; or argue with you. Sorry :-)\n\n&gt; It&#39;s just that Mike and =\r\nEric&#39;s comment (http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/181=\r\n27), about kicking a cat every time a new media type is minted, is contrary=\r\n to your view on media types. They may although be referring to different s=\r\ncenarios?\n\nDunno. I *think* that Mike&#39;s and my thinking is rather aligned a=\r\nnd that Eric is a tiny bit more in favor of doing stuff with link rels than=\r\n suitable for my personal taste. (Just my impression over the years)\n\nI usu=\r\nally favor real (&#39;big&#39;) media types over what I would consider link relatio=\r\nn bloat :-) because it can help to capture protocol semantics in a single d=\r\nocument. I also like it when clients constitute an implementation of &#39;one b=\r\nig&#39; thing as opposed to being a generic machine with link-rel plugins lumpe=\r\nd into them.\n\nHowever, design decisions depend on the actual case and I hav=\r\ne done both with satisfaction. What it comes down to is, I guess, the idea =\r\nthat not every service should lead to a new media type. You should investig=\r\nate your anticipated canonical use cases (the ones that inspire and drive y=\r\nour media type design in the first place) to find similar protocol aspects =\r\nand then stuff those into 1-N media types - with N being not too large (hah=\r\n! great advice :-)\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; And sure, in m2m contexts, you have to tak=\r\ne care not to suffer media type bloat. OTH, the latter will be much better =\r\nthan XML schema and RPC-API bloat.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, having a (enterprise) central =\r\ndefinition of a quote representation must be way better than ten different =\r\ndepartments having each their own SOAP/schema for that.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks, J=F8rn=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
