Now we&#39;re figuring out what interactions with the source\nshould look like.  There are two general approaches on the table.\n\nApproach 1 is to have the GET of the watched resource contain a &quot;notify&quot;\nflag in the headers.  This is getting the watched resource and leaving a\ncallback request at the same time.\n\nApproach 2 is to have two separate transactions, one to GET the watched\nresource and the other to POST to the subscription resource.\n\n\n\n"}}
