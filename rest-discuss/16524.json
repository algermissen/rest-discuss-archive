But, that stipulation fundamentally changes the nature of\n&gt; that debate, as without it, all things may not otherwise be considered\n&gt; equal unless we limit the discussion to non-Internet uses of HTTP.\n\nYes, I (personally) think it would be most useful to add that constraint \nto the conversation and agree that it fundamentally changes the nature \nof the debate - well, think it&#39;s more than clear it does by now!\n\n&gt; Unless you were suggesting that we leave HTTP out of it and only\n&gt; consider REST-the-style.  But, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s realistic, since\n&gt; the best example I can give of how the preference to re-use scales\n&gt; better than the preference to create, is to point to the deployed Web\n&gt; infrastructure that&#39;s geared around the shared understanding of a\n&gt; limited number of ubiquitous types.  While I appreciate your effort to\n&gt; take the debate in a different direction, I hope you understand my\n&gt; concerns.\n\nI wasn&#39;t suggesting that we leave HTTP and the web out of it, however \nperhaps it would be an easy hit to consider only in REST-the-style \nfirst, or in a forked thread, then move on to HTTP and the Web as we \ncommonly think of it.\n\nTo perhaps hit media types &#39;only in REST-the-style&#39; then it would be my \nunderstanding that a shared understanding of the media type by all \nparties is needed, else the messages cannot be understood and the whole \nthing is pointless. How that understanding is formulated is not part of \nREST, however logic and practicalities would probably point us right \nback to a registry of media types and each one with a spec.\n\nI would also like to hear from people who&#39;d consider it &#39;a good thing&#39; \nto mint new media types without the aforementioned stipulation, \ngenerally in the scenario: &quot;I&#39;m making a domain specific application for \nmy client, I&#39;ll make a new media type for it (or for each resource type \nin the domain)&quot;. And what benefits they see in this (google tells me \npeople do this, with examples, so interested to hear).\n\nFinally, yes I understand your concerns, and to some extent share them - \nbut also feel to get anywhere we&#39;d have to clear it up as you&#39;ve \nattempted with the above stipulations or simply move on and address at \nthe end after weighing up all the pros and cons.\n\nRegards,\n\nNathan\n\n"}}
