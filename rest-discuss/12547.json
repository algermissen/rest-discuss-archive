It can be similar\nto REST, even be &quot;constructed&quot; follo=\r\nwing the methodology used by Mr.\nFielding of applying successively sets of =\r\nconstraints to it. But it\nwill not be REST.\n\nLet&#39;s look at the Client/Serve=\r\nr style, for instance:\n\n&quot;A server component, offering a set of services, li=\r\nstens for requests\nupon those services. A client component, desiring that a=\r\n service be\nperformed, sends a request to the server via a connector. The s=\r\nerver\neither rejects or performs the request and sends a response back to\nt=\r\nhe client. (...) A client is a triggering process; a server is a\nreactive p=\r\nrocess. Clients make requests that trigger reactions from\nservers. Thus, a =\r\nclient initiates activity at times of its choosing;\nit often then delays un=\r\ntil its request has been serviced. On the other\nhand, a server waits for re=\r\nquests to be made and then reacts to them.&quot;\n\nThis is clear *not* the case o=\r\nf a Asynchronous Web application. But then again,\n\n&quot;Separation of concerns =\r\nis the principle behind the client-server constraints.&quot;\n\nAnd &quot;separation of=\r\n concerns&quot; should be a valid concern in such application...\n\nSo, it&#39;s my in=\r\nterpretation of the client/server style not being\napplicable to a asynchron=\r\nous app somehow wrong, or do we need another\nstyle that also implements &quot;se=\r\nparation of concerns&quot; using different\nconstraints?\n\nAnd probably for the ot=\r\nher sets of constraints, specially to the\nUniform Interface constraints, si=\r\nmilar considerations can be made?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; * break HATEOAS. =A0In fact, IMO HAT=\r\nEOAS would thrive just as well in an\n&gt; asynchronous environment.\n&gt;\n\n"}}
