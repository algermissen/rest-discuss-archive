Warning:  this document does touch on some\nREST heresy.  ;-)\n\nThere are basically three ways to think about URI:  they are\npointers, or they are queries, or they are commands in an\narbitrarily expressive (possibly computationally-complete)\nlanguage.  The official REST position is that they are pointers\n*only,* and provide a limited form of pointer arithmetic\n(relative URI) in a rigidly constrained context (embedded in\nhypermedia.)  (Well, okay, even a REST purist agrees that\npointers are not sufficient, and we must supplement opaque\npointers with arbitrary query strings to make them useful.  Thus\nthe slippery slope begins...)\n\nThe &quot;heretical&quot; position that I&#39;ve been exploring is the\ntreatment of URI as queries rather than pointers.  By opening up\nthe URI to interpretation and construction on both ends of a\ncommunication instead of just at the server, we turn the URI\nnamespace into a robust query engine and open up the model space.\n\nYet another way, even more questionable way to view URI is as\ncommands.  One very interesting piece of work that does this is\nAT&T Research&#39;s iProxy.  iProxy is an application server deployed\nas a personal client-side proxy;  it sits in the HTTP stream\ndoing normal proxy-like stuff (e.g. caching) but supports\narbitrary local applications (e.g. archiving) as well as stream\napplications on proxied HTTP traffic (e.g. filtering).  It does\nthis by allowing actual request URI to be supplemented by,\nessentially, appending &quot;command strings&quot; on the end of the URI.\nThese commands are parsed out and interpreted by iProxy.  The\nparticular way they are doing it seems rather icky to me, but\nit&#39;s an interesting thought --- and I waffle between thinking\nthat this is a decidedly non-RESTful thing (in particular,\niProxy&#39;s own resource model isn&#39;t obvious or usefully exposed)\nand thinking it&#39;s very RESTful.\n\nAnyone (Mark, Paul, Mike?) care to take a look at iProxy and\nrender an opinion?
