Don&#39;t confuse translation with localization (l10N).\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. If you have a page resource which has had it&#39;s UI elements\n&gt; localized, for example a data entry form, then you are looking at one\n&gt; resource with multiple language-specific representation that you can\n&gt; conneg to.\n&gt;\n&gt; 3. l10N conneg can be either language-driven from the Accept-Language\n&gt; header and/or country-driven from the Request IP address. Both are\n&gt; valid localizations and both can be used in concert. For example, the\n&gt; price of goods and services are country-specific localizations not\n&gt; language-specific (both in terms of the currency used and the tax\n&gt; regime to be applied).\n&gt;\n&gt; 4. If you are looking at translations, then you have different\n&gt; resources. For example, Tolstoy wrote in Russian. If I don&#39;t speak\n&gt; Russian or read Cyrillic, then I should have a &quot;Read the English\n&gt; translation link&quot; I can click. Notice that the UI elements within\n&gt; which the Tolstoy text appears can still be localized (so I see the\n&gt; available translations listed in a language I can understand).\n&gt;\n&gt; 5. With the health warning that URI structure is orthogonal to REST,\n&gt; and whilst the URI is opaque architecturally nonetheless\n&gt; human-readable URIs are good; this is my personal preference for URI\n&gt; structure:\n&gt;\n&gt; example.com/localized-resource     =&gt; the resource URI (no representation)\n&gt; example.com/localized-resource.en | .en-gb  | .fr | .de     =&gt; the\n&gt; language conneg URI (no representation)\n&gt; example.com/localized-resource.en-gb.html | .fr.html     =&gt; the\n&gt; localized html representation\n&gt;\n&gt; if there is an IP-driven country-specific localization:\n&gt;\n&gt; example.co.uk/localized-resource.en-gb.html | .fr.html     =&gt; the\n&gt; localized html representation for the UK\n&gt;\n&gt; when it comes to translations, use the same structure as above except\n&gt; that each translation will have a different name, e.g.\n&gt;\n&gt; example.co.uk/tolstoy-in-russian.en-gb.html | .fr.html     =&gt; the\n&gt; localized html representation for the UK but with Russian content\n&gt; example.co.uk/tolstoy-in-english.en-gb.html | .fr.html     =&gt; the\n&gt; localized html representation for the UK but with the english content\n&gt; translation shown\n&gt;\n&gt; Note to self - I should blog this.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Alan Dean\n&gt; http://twitter.com/adean\n&gt;\n&gt; On Sun, Jan 11, 2009 at 8:34 AM, Subbu Allamaraju &lt;subbu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Jan 10, 2009, at 5:04 PM, Aristotle Pagaltzis wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; All of your charges are valid insofar as my argument wasn&#39;t\n&gt;&gt;&gt; particularly solidly constructed, but I stand by my overall\n&gt;&gt;&gt; thrust that language conneg as per RFC 2616 is a complicated but\n&gt;&gt;&gt; insufficient solution to a non-problem that is actually a feature\n&gt;&gt;&gt; with many advantages.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It is actually the other way around. Changing the language in a UA is\n&gt;&gt; the inconvenient part, and it is likely because users don&#39;t change\n&gt;&gt; their language selection at the OS or UA level often. Language\n&gt;&gt; negotiation itself is not the complicated part.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To answer the original question, the solution really depends on the\n&gt;&gt; client-side usage. If the clients are machines, and are capable of\n&gt;&gt; negotiation, I would stick with language negotiation. If, on the other\n&gt;&gt; hand, the application is user-facing, and users are required to switch\n&gt;&gt; between languages often for this specific application (for whatever\n&gt;&gt; reasons), then provide links to switch between languages.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Subbu\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
