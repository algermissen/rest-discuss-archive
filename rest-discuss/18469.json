They do have different document\nlayout semantics that are useful for visually presenting HTML encoded\ndocuments. That does not imply to me that i should expect/look for\nsimilar semantics in media types for other domains.\n\n&gt; for example, in identifying H-Factors, i choose to characterize them\n&gt; both as &quot;link&quot; elements. i choose to differentiate them based on the\n&gt; &quot;shared understanding&quot; (as defined in the HTML spec) that one\n&gt; indicates a transclusion and the other indicates a navigation.\n\nTo my mind that shared understanding is domain specific, rather than\nan affordance that would necessarily be available in any other\ncontext. Fundamentally, HTML provides a way to describe (graphical)\nuser interfaces. In that context there is a significant difference\nbetween transclusion and navigation. In other visually oriented\ndomains i would also expect a significant differences between\ntransclusion and linking out. However, i find the distinction less\ncompelling once you move to describing domains (read: media types)\nthat are less visually oriented.\n\nBy analogy, i think categorizing media types by whether they have LE\naffordances is a bit like categorizing all physical objects by whether\nthey have a feature that affords pulling. In some contexts (doors)\nsuch a categorization can be useful, in others it is clearly not. So\nwhile you certainly could ask the question &quot;does this object have a\nfeature that affords pulling&quot; for any physical object it is probably\nnot a very important way to segment the set of all physical objects.\n\nAsking that question has negative impacts, though. It encourages\npeople to unnecessarily put pull handles on the sides of houses just\nso they can check that box. It make some wonder if they have missed\nsomething really important because the desk they just designed doesn&#39;t\nhave pull handle. It also causes them to get into long mailing list\ndiscussions about whether the hitch on their trailer counts as pull\nhandle or not. ;)\n\nPeter\nbarelyenough.org\n\n"}}
