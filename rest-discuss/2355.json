This is not specifically in response\nto Mile&#39;s post, but the above paragraph did prompt the thought.  Bear with\nme on this one.  It may take a while to get my &quot;complete&quot; thought out...\n\nWe all know that a URI is not a resource.  It is an identifier of a\nrepresentation of a resource.  The representation may or may not be\nidentical to the resource itself.  When we use PUT to create a resource,\nwhat we are really doing is creating a resource for which the returned\nrepresentation of the same URI is the same as the data we uploaded.  In\nreality, the server may use the request data to create additional resources\nor even augment the data itself when creating the requested resource.  As\nlong as a subsequent GET on the same URI returns a representation that is\nidentical to the PUTted data, then everything is fine.  Given this, it seems\nto me that it would be more correct to say that PUT creates a representation\nof a resource, not the resource itself.  (frankly, I like this view more\nthan where PUT creates the actual resource).\n\nBut now this brings us to DELETE...  If you take a similar view as I do for\nPUT, this means that DELETE only ever removes the representation, not the\nresource itself!  Another way of looking at this is that DELETE invalidates\nan otherwise valid identifier (URI).  The server itself may or may not do\nanything with the data that was in the representation of the related URI.\nThis depends more on the application than on REST.\n\nFor instance, suppose we have a purchase order resource on the server.  It\nhas a representation identified by URI1.  At the same time, suppose we also\nhave another representation of the PO identified by URI2.  For clarity, URI1\nreturns a representation of the entire PO, while URI2 returns a\nrepresentation of only the header (billing address, shipping address, etc.).\nNow, suppose we could DELETE URI2.  Does this delete the PO header?  Of\ncourse not.  But it could very well cause URI2 to become invalidated (i.e.\nsubsequent requests to the same URI fail).\n\nIt also occurs to me that this could be an interesting way to implement\nmutexes for a resource.  Successful creation of a URI that identifies a\nresource indicates a lock.  Subsequent requests use the created URI to\naccess the resource.  When done, you DELETE the URI.  This releases the lock\nbut does not delete the underlying resource.\n\nWell, I think that&#39;s it for now.  I hope it makes sense.  :~)\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
