However, I think much of the \nconfusion and misunderstanding surrounding HATEOAS is precisely because \nthe simplistic way of explaining it in terms of just &quot;hipermedia&quot;, or \n&quot;the hipermedia constraint&quot;, or even &quot;connectedness&quot;.\n\n&gt; TheRESTful Web Services \n&gt; &lt;http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529260/&gt; book doesn’t help the \n&gt; situation by renaming the hypertext engine as /connectedness/. That \n&gt; does nothing but obscure its role as the driving force in RESTful \n&gt; applications.\nSo at least maybe we say as Roy Fielding said it, and at least refer to \nHATEOAS in a simplified way as *hypertext engine*, or *hipermedia \nengine*? As I said earlier, I think the key word here is &quot;engine&quot;.\n\nOr maybe this is one of those concepts that have no simplification?\n\n&gt; But for the purposes of having a short way to refer to the concept, I&#39;ve\n&gt; never found &quot;the hypermedia constraint&quot; or &quot;hypermedia&quot; to be\n&gt; insufficient.  And they&#39;re far preferable to &quot;HATEOAS&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n\n\n"}}
