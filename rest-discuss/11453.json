A couple of thoughts, keyed by slide number\nin square brackets:\n\n* [14] The idea that all important resources are given one URI seems\n  more restrictive than need be -- I don&#39;t see a problem with having\n  multiple URIs for one resource (GET /orders/latestday and GET /orders/20081107\n  might return the same results, at least today), or having a URI that\n  returns a collection of resources.  When describing REST to newbies,\n  I prefer a statement like &quot;All interesting resources are given at least\n  one URI&quot; to get to the point I think you&#39;re trying to make here.\n\n* [24] Although a particular system might have both REST and WS_* interfaces,\n  I would hope you make the point in your comments that it&#39;s unlikely you will\n  be able to use the same server side classes to process both kinds of requests.\n  Properly done, the two kinds of resource classes will be organized\n  quite differently, but developers new to this still think they can\nbe combined.\n\n* [27] Maybe I just missed it, but I would have expected to see a discussion of\n  supporting multiple representations somewhere (maybe here).  Maybe its also\n  because this particular area is the most troubling about REST for me\n... even if\n  you have agreed to an XML representation, how is the client supposed to &quot;know&quot;\n  that a &lt;link/&gt; element is actually a URI that can be used to\ninstigate a state change,\n  as opposed to (say) a &lt;uri&gt; element instead?\n\nCraig McClanahan\n\n"}}
