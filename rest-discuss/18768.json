Thanks.\nNow, it is very difficult =\r\nto add points to such a broad set of implementations. I like the matrix ide=\r\na, but with a twist, using it like we are using a competency framework at I=\r\nASA.\n\nWe can put a set of features and a list of levels for each. Say, in a=\r\nrchitecture, viewpoints. The architect may 1. never heard of them, 2. know =\r\nthe theory, 3. used them once or twice. 4. can&#39;t live without using them, 5=\r\n. He invented them.\n\nLikewise, levels for each feature would be 1. no suppo=\r\nrt, 2. can be done somehow, 3. offers a special component for it, 4. Fully =\r\nautomated. \n\nThat matrix can be a better tool for deciding, based on what d=\r\no I need from the framework, I read the matrix&#39;s scorecard for the framewor=\r\nk and I may know the tool with the best combination of features.\n\nThe matur=\r\nity model idea was simply because I visualize the tool at early stages only=\r\n offering basic http support for a simple REST service, and at latest stage=\r\n in evolution offering support for complex systems, that is why the levels =\r\nare incremental, and each level may improve the support on the lower levels=\r\n features. I&#39;m risking here one tool offering a non balanced solution with =\r\nsupport for on-demand code  and at the same time very basic http support. T=\r\nhe actual evaluation of current frameworks would give us an idea of that, i=\r\nf there is one FW that comes out to be in more that one level.\n\nNo worries =\r\nabout the article published, as nothing is written in stone and there is al=\r\nways a &quot;...revisited&quot; kind of article possibility.\n\nDo you use any framewor=\r\nk? Where would you put it using the model&#39;s levels?\n\nCheers!\n\nWilliam.\n\n---=\r\n In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Markus Lanthaler&quot; &lt;markus.lanthaler@...&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi William,\n&gt; \n&gt; Looks to be an interesting &quot;project&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Now, please bear in mind this is\n&gt; &gt; not a competition, where higher leve=\r\nl means that framework wins. As\n&gt; &gt; stated in the article, even level 1 ful=\r\nly supports REST, only the\n&gt; &gt; developer may need to do some extra work to =\r\nget there. What we are\n&gt; &gt; looking for is evaluating the frameworks in a wa=\r\ny that helps the\n&gt; &gt; framework makers and the users to identify the needs a=\r\nnd solutions. It\n&gt; &gt; is like suggesting a tool and testing it in the field =\r\nfor tuning.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s quite normal that people use those levels as ranking.=\r\n I think it would\n&gt; make the intention much clearer if you would create a m=\r\natrix instead of\n&gt; using these (maturity) levels. So, e.g., framework X has=\r\n support for routing\n&gt; and media types whereas framework Y has hypermedia/s=\r\nemantics support.\n&gt; \n&gt; You can&#39;t do that that easily with levels. Framework=\r\n X is on level 3 and 5??\n&gt; Is it then also on 4? What about 1 and 2 then? B=\r\nut maybe it&#39;s too late to\n&gt; change that as the article has already been pub=\r\nlished..\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; Markus Lanthaler\n&gt; @markuslanthaler\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
