I also noticed you were foll=\r\nowing Roy&#39;s rant guide (I mean, the guide in the rant :D ).\nBTW, Antonio&#39;s =\r\npoint about multi protocols should be discussed a little bit in another com=\r\nment.\n\nBut now on this one: I read it and was able to understand the intent=\r\nion, although it was not explicit. If I change my REST knowledge, reducing =\r\nit to a that of an RPC developer that knows REST is good and his boss told =\r\nhim to implement, quick and dirty, a REST API, I may have problems. I will =\r\nbe probably driven to think I&#39;m defining a mapping for my RPC calls.\n\nSo, m=\r\ny suggestion (bear with me as I treat all people as my university students)=\r\n is to introduce the article by explaining a RESTSFull API is designed not =\r\nby defining the procedures to call on a data element, but by defining a dat=\r\na element representation that has such and such attributes to allow such an=\r\nd such REST constrains.\nThen go on saying that regular RPC approach would b=\r\ne to define that list of operations you have there. Next, explain that your=\r\n first step would be to define the resource (entity and semantics), and the=\r\nn define a representation (a media type) that will help user-agents work wi=\r\nth that resource. Make clear that the actual List (resource) is implemented=\r\n in the server in whatever form the designer wants: it may be a table in a =\r\ndatabase, an in memory array, a Vector, even a HashTable of some sort, or a=\r\n hierarchical filesystem structure, you imagine. Client does not care, it r=\r\neceives the representation/media type your are defining. That is because re=\r\ngular developer may thing the list SHOULD be stored in the server as an XML=\r\n like the one you post, in other words, you are defining the actual storage=\r\n format. Again, foresee confusion and be defensive.\n\nI wont go on with the =\r\nrest of the article, but that would be my style. Long, slow description mak=\r\ning special emphasis on some concepts that may be confusing to the reader. =\r\nFor instance, when mapping the protocol, be clear you are not mapping the o=\r\nperations in the beginning to those of the protocol (making the protocol yo=\r\nur PRC implementor), but using the protocol semantics to manipulate the res=\r\nource, getting similar results as the operations above, and stating that th=\r\ne actual manipulation may be different altogether.\n\nOf course, you have you=\r\nr style, and the approach of the article is great (show by doing), but our =\r\ndiscussion about perceptions of the meaning of some concepts makes me caref=\r\nully trying not to confuse the reader.\n\nCheers!\n\nWilliam Martinez.\n\n\n--- In=\r\n rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, mike amundsen &lt;mamund@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve p=\r\nosted a blog entry labeled &quot;A RESTful Hypermedia API in Three\n&gt; Easy Steps&quot;=\r\n[1].
