Yes, that is a good objection.\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t see self-descriptiveness as a default for data. On the\n&gt; contrary, I see that it takes nontrivial effort on the part of\n&gt; designers to craft self-descriptive data.\n\nI guess what I was thinking of should possibly be termed\nself-containedness rather than self-descriptiveness. A cookie\nwhich serves as an address into a session store whence the server\nretrieves information that will affect the message’s processing\nmeans that the request is no longer self-contained.\n\nThis concern is actually orthogonal to self-descriptiveness. It\nis conceivable that a message could contain a header that serves\nas a key into a server-side session which is understood as such\nby both ends as well as any intermediaries. In that case the\nrequest would be self-descriptive, yet not self-contained.\n\nWhat I meant is that cookies don’t violate self-containedness if\nthey are merely opaque adjunct information sent along with a\nrequest, such as a proprietary form of auth token.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
