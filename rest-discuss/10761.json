Do the links\nreally have to point to versions specifically or can they point to  \n&#39;master&#39; resources that represent the target\nconcept as such?\n\nIf you really must point to a version and really must point from a  \nversion (instead of accumulating the\nlinks in the master resource) then you probably just need to duplicate  \nthe links.\n\nMaybe it helps to make the links first class objects and version them  \nalso?\n\nYou can find a deeper treatment of the subject here:\n\n&lt;http://www.coolheads.com/SRNPUBS/ref-track-docs-paper.pdf&gt;\n\nAnd propably it also helps to have a look at repository software such as\nCVS and SVN and how they manage versions and releases etc.\n\nHTH,\n\nJan\n\n\n\nOn May 7, 2008, at 10:37 PM, Miles Crawford wrote:\n\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; My question is about versioning RESTful resources with URIs.\n&gt;\n&gt; I often see as a &quot;best practice&quot; the user of a version number in  \n&gt; URIs such as:\n&gt;\n&gt; /v1/person/{username}\n&gt;\n&gt; and then, if your service changes:\n&gt;\n&gt; /v2/person/{username}\n&gt;\n&gt; So - here&#39;s my question.  Say my organization wants to create two\n&gt; services that relate to one another, a generic person service and a\n&gt; student service. How do I avoid loops that cause troubles with version\n&gt; numbers?\n&gt;\n&gt; A timeline:\n&gt; v1 person released, links to v1 student\n&gt; v1 student releasted, links to v1 person.\n&gt; time passes...\n&gt; v2 person released, links to v1 student\n&gt; time passes...\n&gt; v2 student released, links to v2 person.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now a client can get a v2 student, link to a v2 person and then link\n&gt; back to a v1 student.\n&gt;\n&gt; Has anyone had problems with this type of mismatch? Anyone see clean  \n&gt; solutions?\n&gt;\n&gt; -miles\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
