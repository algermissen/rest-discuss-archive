It was a deeply unpleasant experience.\n&gt; \n&gt; Try this one:\n&gt; \n&gt;   http://bitworking.org/projects/httplib2/\n\nDoes httplib2 provide a way to set timeouts? I didn&#39;t see that in the\ndocs.\n\n&lt;rant&gt;\nThat&#39;s been my biggest complaint with python&#39;s standard network client\nlibraries.  Everything is in blocking mode with no timeout.  And the\nhigher-level libraries like httplib don&#39;t provide any way to change\nthat, so you&#39;re left with socket.setdefaulttimeout() which is (ugh)\nglobal.\n\nIf you can get a handle to the underlying socket you can always call\nsocket.settimeout(), but httplib makes that very inconvenient: you\ncan&#39;t do it using the simple request() method.  So instead you have to\ndo the whole connect(), putrequest(), putheader(), endheaders(),\nsend(), getresponse() sequence by hand; and you&#39;d have to look at the\nsource of httplib.py to find out that the socket is at self.sock after\nconnect() has been called, so you then call foo.sock.settimeout(t).\n\nWhich still doesn&#39;t help if the call to sock.connect() hangs, because\nHTTPConnection.connect() both creates the socket and then calls\nsock.connect(). As the socket module documentation says: &quot;Note that\nthe connect() operation is subject to the timeout setting, and in\ngeneral it is recommended to call settimeout() before calling\nconnect().&quot;  So you&#39;re stuck with needing to call the global\nsocket.setdefaulttimeout(), or (probably better) write a subclass of\nHTTPConnection that isn&#39;t so stupid.\n\nThe end result is that the easy stuff is useless in the real world,\nand the poor beginner has to read and understand the source code of\nhttplib.py just to write an app that won&#39;t hang.\n\nThat all adds up to a pretty huge WTF in my opinion.\n&lt;/rant&gt;\n\n--\n\nPaul Winkler\nhttp://www.slinkp.com\n\n"}}
