I was watching a presentation on RDF a couple of weeks\nago and came to the realization that for RDF to work properly it seems\nyou have to have REST. RDF is all about links and you can&#39;t link to a\nSOAP endpoint because the SOAP endpoints are just conduits that listen\nfor and dispatch SOAP messages.\n\n &gt; \n &gt; This is interesting. I&#39;m working w/ Max (cc:&#39;d) on showing SOAP Encoding\n &gt; XSLT&#39;d into RDF, and queried and stored using RDF tools. And *merged*,\n &gt; which is imho the interesting thing. Taking SOAP Encoded msgs from\n &gt; multiple sources and merging them into a single store, so that queries\n &gt; that need both info-sources to be answered can be serviced.\n\nYes, this makes sense. SOAP messages themselves are documents. But\nmost people would ship those messages to SOAP listeners. They would\nnot just put the messages at the end of a URI.\n\n &gt; \n &gt; The two worlds aren&#39;t as far apart as people suppose...\n\nThis statement is true as far as SOAP messages are concerned. It&#39;s the\nSOAP RPC side of the coin that poses a challenge.\n\n &gt; \n &gt; More on this soon I hope, using the Ruby/RAA stuff as a testbed (see prev\n &gt; thread here on this...).\n &gt; \n &gt; cheers,\n &gt; \n &gt; Dan\n &gt; \n &gt; \n &gt; -- \n &gt; mailto:danbri@...\n &gt; http://www.w3.org/People/DanBri/\n &gt; \n\n-- \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nAllan Doyle                         http://www.intl-interfaces.com\nadoyle@...\n\n\n"}}
