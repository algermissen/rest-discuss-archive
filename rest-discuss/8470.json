The client does not need a priori\n&gt; knowledge of the server URI space. It constructs (some parts of)\n&gt; a URI, but:\n\nA computation is needed to create the link. &quot;Complex&quot; is a word game I \ndon&#39;t buy into here; on that basis EPRs are complex too.\n\n&gt; It does so based on directions provided to it within a\n&gt; representation returned from the server (and according to the\n&gt; rules for query strings).\n\nRight, I need a preprocessor. I&#39;m not getting how a form is only \nseemingly opaque. If you&#39;re saying it depends on the media type, then \nthat&#39;s fine, but stronger claims about URI opacity need to be made \ncontingent on that. We haven&#39;t even talked about URI templates yet.\n\n&gt; Therefore, this is still representational state transfer. This is\n&gt; what Royâ€™s recent message boils down to:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Roy T. Fielding &lt;fielding@... &lt;mailto:fielding%40gbiv.com&gt;&gt; \n&gt; [2007-05-10 18:00]:\n&gt;  &gt; It is essential to eliminate the coupling between client and\n&gt;  &gt; server. If the application doesn&#39;t follow the workflow defined\n&gt;  &gt; by the representations that are received, then the application\n&gt;  &gt; isn&#39;t using the REST style. Not even a little bit. It is using\n&gt;  &gt; RPC plus streaming, with a rather inefficient syntax, and the\n&gt;  &gt; client will break each time the server&#39;s application evolves\n&gt;  &gt; because the client must be anticipating the server&#39;s state\n&gt;  &gt; based on its own assumptions. In other words, the two are\n&gt;  &gt; coupled by their original design.\n&gt; \n&gt; In a sense, forms are just a compression scheme. They can be used\n&gt; to express an infinite amount of links with a single description\n&gt; that encompasses all of them. But representational state transfer\n&gt; is still happening because such a manifold link must still be\n&gt; provided by the server to the client inside a representation.\n\nSorry, but I suspect this ends up with an infinite tape.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n\n"}}
