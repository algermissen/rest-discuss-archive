That&#39;s just the\n&gt; fact of it. APIs are contacts. Change the contract, bad things happen.\n&gt; Design APIs with growth and flexibility in mind, and you can have a\n&gt; more forgiving client/server experience.\n\nAgreed. I just think that we are making a mistake when we claim that  \nREST magically makes M2M interaction have the same amount of loose  \ncoupling than human to machine interactions. Much of the reluctance  \nagainst REST in an enterprise context IMO results from the actually  \nexisting contract in M2M scenarios notoriously being talked away.\n\nIf you tell Joe developer to evolve that service, you better be able  \nto tell him what exactly he can do and what not. He should not have to  \ncall the client owners because not having to bring the client and  \nserver owners together when evolving is one of *the* top advantages of  \nREST.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; By using media types and HATEOAS, the clients retain a bit of\n&gt; discoverability. It&#39;s not so much discoverability, as it is state\n&gt; awareness. It can &quot;know&quot; where it is at any point of the process, and\n&gt; it &quot;knows&quot; where to go from there. If it follows the links given with\n&gt; the types specified, the client will be told where to go next.\n\nYes, that is true. But it also conflicts with the state machine that  \nthe client itself has. It is not entirely driven by the service (as  \nthe human user is). It at least makes use of a set of partially  \nordered goals (e.g. you must order before you cancel an order, you  \nmust order before you pay, etc.).\n\nThis set of partially ordered goals is in a way exactly what e.g.  \nAtomPub establishes. The goal order is specified by saying what  \noutgoing transitions (== next available goals) to expect after  \ncompleting a certain goal.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; This is key. The client isn&#39;t &quot;waiting to do the next thing&quot;. It&#39;s not\n&gt; got a &quot;list of things to do&quot;, and going through them one by one.\n&gt; Rather it has a list of guideposts that it&#39;s told to follow, and the\n&gt; actual PATH it takes isn&#39;t known to the client until it reaches a goal\n&gt; post.\n\nYeah - good line of thought. OTH, I have not managed to code a client  \nthat does not eventually have its own state machine that inevitably  \ndrives the clients program flow. No matter how much you make the  \nclient to be driven by the server.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Now you can code all of that in to the client, it &quot;knows&quot; where to go,\n&gt; it build URLs, and when things change, the client breaks. Because the\n&gt; client is a stupid client and while it functioned, it did it all the\n&gt; wrong way.\n\nSuppose you code a client to an AtomPub server that has a collection  \nof orders and you want the client to calculate the average order  \namount. Can you show me how you do that without expecting the GET on  \nthe order collection to return an Atom feed (or any other *previously*  \nknown media type)?\n\n\nGET /service-doc\n\n... pick order collection based on category ...\n\nGET /orders\n\nAnd now - how do you code from here without relying on the fact that  \nAtomPub tells you that collections come as Atom feeds?\n\n\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; So, that&#39;s, to me, where some of the robustness of the whole thing\n&gt; comes from, even in a M2M world.\n\n--------------------------------------\nJan Algermissen\n\nMail: algermissen@...\nBlog: http://algermissen.blogspot.com/\nHome: http://www.jalgermissen.com\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n"}}
