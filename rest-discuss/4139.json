Using this\n&gt; &gt; syntax fo=\r\nr non-primary keys should return 404.\n&gt;\n&gt; I like this idea.\n&gt;\n&gt; One problem=\r\n, however, is that this syntax makes the path\n&gt; segment &quot;company=3DACME&quot; wi=\r\nth a single parameter\n&gt; &quot;branch=3DPheonix&quot;, according to the letter of the =\r\nspecification\n&gt; (rfc 2396). The syntax seems intended to provide parameters=\r\n\n&gt; relating to the segment, similar to actual parameters to a\n&gt; procedure c=\r\nall.\n\nI wondered about that, but it is syntactically valid, and no\nsemantic=\r\ns are defined for such parameters anyway. According to\nthe grammar in Secti=\r\non 3.3, &quot;company=3DACME;branch=3DPheonix&quot; as a\nwhole matches &quot;segment&quot;, tho=\r\nugh indeed only &quot;branch=3DPheonix&quot;\nmatches &quot;param&quot;.\n\nOoh, I just realized w=\r\ne&#39;ve been misspelling Phoenix. :) I&#39;ll\ncontinue for consistency.\n\n&gt; What ab=\r\nout applying the parameters to the table segment?\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/accounts/customer;c=\r\nompany=3DACME;branch=3DPheonix&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Or applying the parameters to a null se=\r\ngment?\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/accounts/customer/;company=3DACME;branch=3DPheonix&gt;\n\nThe forme=\r\nr isn&#39;t right because it loses the hierarchical\nstructure. The latter is be=\r\ntter but the extra semicolon seems\nunnecessary.\n\n&gt; &gt; Oh, and a table with a=\r\n non-compound primary key could allow\n&gt; &gt; both the named and unnamed versio=\r\nn:\n&gt; &gt; &lt;/school/student/ID=3D123-45-6789&gt; vs.\n&gt; &gt; &lt;/school/student/123-45-6=\r\n789&gt;. The two syntaxes are\n&gt; &gt; unambiguous as long as both forms always hav=\r\ne the value\n&gt; &gt; properly escaped.\n&gt;\n&gt; Might need to be convinced on this on=\r\ne. I think the fact that\n&gt; there are two URIs that, by definition, refer to=\r\n the same\n&gt; resource just confuses the issue.\n\nOne could easily redirect to=\r\n the other, or give a\nContent-Location header for the preferred form. I lik=\r\ne the\nconciseness of the unnamed form, but the named form should be\nsupport=\r\ned for consistency with the compound key case. Compound\nkey URIs are multip=\r\nle anyway, since the parameters could be given\nin any order. In any case, o=\r\nne version will be preferred and can\nbe returned in the Content-Location he=\r\nader.\n\nAll of these concerns would be resolved if the compound key form\nwas=\r\n instead &lt;/accounts/customer/ACME;branch=3DPheonix&gt;. This may\nmake sense if=\r\n one of the columns is more general and the others\nare more specific, which=\r\n seems to be true in this case (and is\nprobably generally true, come to thi=\r\nnk of it). (At first I\nthought the column order would matter, but since onl=\r\ny one column\nis unnamed in this form, it&#39;s unambiguous even if they&#39;re give=\r\nn\nin reverse order as &lt;/accounts/customer/Pheonix;company=3DACME&gt;.\nAgain, o=\r\nne version will be preferred and can be returned in the\nContent-Location he=\r\nader.)\n\nOf course, the column order could just as well be enforced to\nmatch=\r\n the order in the table schema (or the primary key\nconstraint definition, I=\r\n guess). Primary key-based URIs will\ngenerally be constructed and returned =\r\nfrom the server anyway, as\nopposed to query-based URIs which could be const=\r\nructed by the\nclient using some kind of form mechanism. Hmmm, yeah, I like =\r\nthat\nreasoning.\n\nHeck, if we enforce the ordering it could even be\n&lt;/accoun=\r\nts/customer/ACME;Pheonix&gt;. :)\n\nFun, fun, fun.\n\nJustin\n\n"}}
