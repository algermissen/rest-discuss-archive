Generic may not be a client per se, but a framework that allows\n&gt; to create a client by some sort of configuration (description language?\n&gt; may not be adopted since it recalls WSDL which is hated nowadays\n&gt; and misunderstood) or training where it learns the semantics.\n&gt; 2. A standardized (or at least agreed upon) set of ways to define\n&gt; links to represent those semantics. (WSDL like again?)\n&gt; 3. The actual particular code, AKA the plugin part you will create.\n\nBut, in itself, isn&#39;t any &quot;good&quot; REST payload implicitly\nself-describing? It may not be a COMPLETE documentation of the API or\nthe service, but in and of itself and it&#39;s own little world view, it\nshould be a relatively complete description, at least at rough level.\n\nIf you happen to be sending XML payload, XML Schema can fill in much\nof the details.\n\nAssuming you can interpret the link references, possibly combined wit\nOPTIONS, then a client should be able to make available all of the\nstate transitions, as well as be able to create properly formatted,\nthough not necessarily populated, payloads.\n\nI don&#39;t know how any document can communicate semantics to a machine,\nfrankly. A Java doc, for example, auto generated from a class\ndefinition gives a nice, worthless summary of a class. But it\ncertainly has the information necessary to handle the physical\ncommunication with that class.\n\n&gt; Just a word about WSDL. The biggest mistake was the code generation.\n&gt; If WSDL was to be interpreted on the fly, and the interactions dynamically\n&gt; followed, I guess people would not non-sensically hate it as they do now.\n&gt; So, that framework IS NOT A CODE GENERATION thing. It should read\n&gt; and process the config on the fly, and the config is to be provided by the\n&gt; first URL you hit in the system. See?\n\nCode generation exists because of a limitation of the static\nimplementation languages. Dynamic languages don&#39;t need code generation\nspecifically because they&#39;re dynamic languages.\n\nPeople can, and have, written dynamic interfaces to WSDL web services,\neven for static languages. They&#39;re just a pain to use from the coders\npoint of view, and offer none of the value of a static language.\n\nIn either case, whether it&#39;s code generated or a client, I don&#39;t\nunderstand where you get &quot;dynamically&quot; followed.\n\nIf a schema changed, and eliminated previous fields that your code was\npopulating, that&#39;s an error. It could in theory respond to new,\noptional but defaulted fields, but that&#39;s quite the edge case in\ngeneral IMHO.\n\nSo, I guess I&#39;m not clear on how folks think a system can interact\n&quot;dynamically&quot; with another system when there&#39;s, in the end, some code\nsomewhere driving the transaction.\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n(willh@...)\n\n"}}
