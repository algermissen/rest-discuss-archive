That is why I want notification to be\n&gt; a distinct method (so as not to get confused with\n&gt; whatever listener management the client\n&gt; implements).\n\nThe problem with this is that (a) *new methods impose unnecessary adoption friction*, and (b)\n*NOTIFY to a listener is not a reasonable part of the generic interface of resources, as not\nall resources can be listeners.*  New methods should only be created for generic operations\nthat are universally meaningful to all potential resources.\n\n&gt; However, you don&#39;t like NOTIFY because it only\n&gt; applies to listener URLs and not all URLs are\n&gt; listener URLs.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, my question to you is whether all HTTP methods\n&gt; have to apply to all resources.\n\nI believe this to be the case.  Whether or not a particular resource supports a particular\nmethod should be an authorization concern, not an interface concern.  Truly universal generic\ninterfaces have LOTs of benefits;  introducing new type-specific interfaces for certain\nresource types is a slippery slope toward losing all the benefits of genericity.\n\n&gt; As I said above, I don&#39;t see why we can&#39;t use\n&gt; NOTIFY to indicate a change on http://foo.com\n&gt; and leave POST for the listener to manage itself\n&gt; in the normal HTTP way.\n\nLet me think about this.  The argument for is that this already exists for proxy caches;  the\nargument against is that reusing it for this purpose may confuse the issue, *and* it&#39;s not\nclear that it&#39;s generic enough.  Maybe it doesn&#39;t break things.  Let me digest this.\n\nWe&#39;re getting awfully close to the same problem as notification for proxy caches with all of\nthis...  hmmm....\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
