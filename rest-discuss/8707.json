The battle\nI think we&#39;re still wondering about is &quot;the enterprise&quot; -- using REST\nto make business integration more evolvable & productive.\n\nThere, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s winning, necessarily, but I do think it&#39;s\nalmost finished &quot;crossing the chasm&quot;.   The Atom Publishing Protocol\nseems to be the event driving that, but this is also helped by releases\nlike GData, the Facebook platform, Amazon S3, the Sam Ruby book, etc.\n\nBut WS-splat web services continue to flourish unabated in most\nenterprises.   I think that those looking at WSDL 2.0 and WS-Addressing\nare either horrified or enthralled, depending on their value system.  \nMost still haven&#39;t heard of REST, and typically get a quizzical look\nwhen I bring it up in my travels.    The reaction is not negative, mind\nyou, but I think it&#39;s indicative of the stage of the journey.\n\nThe big adoption will occur when OSS groups & vendors come out with a\nnew breed of tools that don&#39;t just staple a bag labeled &quot;REST&quot; on the\nside, but actually provide an agent-oriented platform that&#39;s based on\nthe architecture.  All the effort has been too server-focused, in my\nview.\n\nWe often dream about the leaps in flexibility and evolution over time\ndue to the constraints of REST, but it hasn&#39;t quite made its way into\nthe agent&#39;s development environment.  But I don&#39;t think even the early\nadopters know what this quite would look like.   It could be radically\ndifferent than what we&#39;re used to.  And it&#39;s a very different direction\nfrom the current rage, BPM-land (tagline, &quot;all your process are belong\nto us&quot;).\n\nCheers\nStu\n\n--- Stefan Tilkov &lt;stefan.tilkov@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Nothing new for folks around here, probably, but still:\n&gt; \n&gt; \thttp://www.infoq.com/news/2007/05/is-rest-winning\n&gt; \n&gt; Stefan\n&gt; --\n&gt; Stefan Tilkov, http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/\n&gt; \n\n\n\n       \n____________________________________________________________________________________Ready for the edge of your seat? \nCheck out tonight&#39;s top picks on Yahoo!
