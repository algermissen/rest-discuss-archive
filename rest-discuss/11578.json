I have to provide data in the request body (It could be a  \n&gt; xml description or even an image). The request is safe. The response  \n&gt; can&#39;t be cached since it depends on the request body. Moreover, the  \n&gt; URL does not have to be shared. What are the problems of using POST  \n&gt; in that situation?\n&gt;\n&gt; Are you aware of any problem with implementations or proxies for GET  \n&gt; requests that contains a body?\n&gt;\nI don&#39;t know that this is any form of a preferred approach, but where  \npossible, I like to turn the query itself into an information resource  \nso that it can be shared. You can POST the query into a /query  \ninformation space, get an ID associated with it and then do a GET to / \nquery/&lt;id&gt; (or PUT it to a named query). This link can be shared,  \nreused, cached, etc. You can also imagine building a query system  \nwhere you can override default (or expected values) as part of the GET  \ntoo:\n\nGET /query/&lt;id&gt;?custid=1234\n\nThat is potentially cacheable as well.\n\n\n\n"}}
