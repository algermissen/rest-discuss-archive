EG, the above aggregator could just as well have been a\nnotification service of the kind we are discussing here.\n\n\n\n&gt; &gt; Hmmm.  There&#39;s a general problem of watched resources not wanting to be\n&gt; &gt; watched.  Maybe they don&#39;t have the bandwidth to sustain polling\nloops,o &gt; &gt; maybe they&#39;re huge files.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, you could have a situation where a third party notification\n&gt; purposely or accidentally causes a major load on some server.\n\n\n\n"}}
