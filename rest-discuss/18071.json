You&#39;re proposing a\n&gt;=\r\n change to HTTP which has no basis in other protocols; REST tells us why\n&gt; =\r\nHTTP&#39;s methods so strongly resemble the methods found in protocols HTTP\n&gt; i=\r\ns based on and interoperates with.  GET and PUT in HTTP identify the\n&gt; same=\r\n generic transaction semantics identified by GET and PUT in FTP.\n\nJust to b=\r\ne clear: I&#39;m not proposing this change. I don&#39;t even really know Ruby. :) I=\r\n&#39;m not advocating changing the HTTP spec, just trying to understand what it=\r\n means, and whether the proposed Rails usage is compatible with that or not=\r\n. I&#39;ve already agreed that PUT (as defined by httpbis) does not include par=\r\ntial updates, although RFC2616 doesn&#39;t make this sufficiently clear (as evi=\r\ndenced by the need to elaborate it much more in httpbis), and it&#39;s the only=\r\n published standard. So I am just someone interested in understanding the i=\r\nssue and what&#39;s going on. I come down on the side of Rails probably ought t=\r\no be HTTP-compliant, and that we shouldn&#39;t change the HTTP spec just for Ra=\r\nils. I just didn&#39;t know if partial updates were HTTP-compliant or not (unti=\r\nl this thread).\n\nThat said, REST just requires that HTTP have a uniform def=\r\ninition for its methods, not that it has any particular methods (other than=\r\n GET). So I maintain that this is an HTTP discussion about what PUT means, =\r\nand that the outcome of that discussion doesn&#39;t change the fact that the we=\r\nb architecture of HTTP is RESTful.
