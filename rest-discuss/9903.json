This new user simply sees a non-personalized \nsite and will probably be asked to login to get their own personalized \nversion.  (And note that the server does NOT vary the response based on \nauth information for the original page, only the secondary XHR to \n/usr/current/data/ which seems OK to me.)\n\nOf course this is for a general page that has some personalized bits in \nit.  A link to a user&#39;s cart would certainly need to have that user&#39;s \nuser-id in the URL and another user trying to access it will either be \nallowed to see it or not.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; JoAnn.com, a pretty major player in the sewing/craft industry, hands\n&gt; out URLs that include a session ID.  If I had a nickel for every time\n&gt; someone had enthusiastically posted an URL in a craftblog, referring\n&gt; readers to this page or a variant thereof:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.joann.com/joann/common/session_expire_error.jsp;jsessionid=U0VRVRT1ITB0YP4SY5NFAFR50LD3KUPU\n&gt;\n\nYuck!\n\n&gt; ... I would be a rich person. (And go to that link, and notice where\n&gt; the &quot;click here&quot; takes you. Obviously the inclusion of the sessionid\n&gt; is *not* the only problem going on there. Yikes. Can you *get* more\n&gt; annoying than that?)\n&gt;\n&gt; But I digress.  The inability to share links was the main reason I\n&gt; keep user-specific URLs an absolute minimum.\n&gt;\n\n"}}
