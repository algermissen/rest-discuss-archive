We hav=\r\ne built a comprehensive yet small framework since them, with a thriving com=\r\nmunity behind it. \n\nOur Restlet API is both client-side and server-side, bo=\r\nth low-level (all HTTP semantics/headers mapped to a clean Java API, see [2=\r\n]) and high-level (resource handling, limited/focused use of annotations), =\r\nsynchronous or asynchronous (easily supporting provisional 1xx HTTP respons=\r\nes), supports other (pseudo-)protocols than HTTP (FTP, SMTP, POP3, FILE, et=\r\nc.) and is available in five consistent editions: Java SE/EE, GAE, GWT and =\r\nAndroid [3].\n\nWe also happen to support JAX-RS as an extension, but that&#39;s =\r\nnot what I would recommend as a starting point for you. Our framework lets =\r\ndevelopers support hypermedia since day one and we have explored higher-lev=\r\nel links traversal for a while with our RDF extension [4]. \n\nOtherwise, we =\r\nare also working with Microsoft Interop teams to provide advanced client su=\r\npport for the OData protocol [5].\n\nIMHO, it would be great to have somethin=\r\ng similar in the .NET world. I&#39;m glad you are working on such project. Good=\r\n luck!\n\nBest regards,\nJerome Louvel\n--\nRestlet ~ Founder and Technical Lead=\r\n ~ http://www.restlet.org\nNoelios Technologies ~ http://www.noelios.com\n\n\n[=\r\n1] http://www.restlet.org\n[2] http://wiki.restlet.org/docs_2.0/13-restlet/2=\r\n7-restlet/330-restlet/130-restlet.html\n[3] http://wiki.restlet.org/docs_2.0=\r\n/13-restlet/21-restlet/318-restlet/303-restlet.html\n[4] http://www.restlet.=\r\norg/documentation/snapshot/jee/ext/org/restlet/ext/rdf/RdfClientResource.ht=\r\nml\n[5] http://blog.noelios.com/2010/03/15/restlet-supports-odata-the-open-d=\r\nata-protocol/\n\n\n\n"}}
