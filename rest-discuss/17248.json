The separation between resources and the=\r\nir representations allow resources that correspond to non-document things (=\r\nconcepts, real-world objects etc) to have HTTP-friendly representations. (h=\r\naving said that, http-range-14 is a bit of a rathole, but the TAG&#39;s resolut=\r\nion with 303s etc seems Good Enough).\n\nSo this part I suggest could be call=\r\ned &quot;transparent&quot;, there aren&#39;t really any interop obstacles on the horizon =\r\nfrom the perspectives of REST, HTTP or Semantic Web/Linked Data. \n\nBut your=\r\n following comments do raise some very interesting issues.\n\n&gt; [...] Hyperme=\r\ndia Driven Application State of the REST principles. This principle can aga=\r\nin be powered for better machine processing by using the common knowledge r=\r\nepresentation languages of the Semantic Web as basis. \n\nOk, agreed. By gene=\r\nralizing from documents to /anything/, the resources and their relationship=\r\ns (via their representations), are potentially a lot more open to direct ma=\r\nchine processing.\n\n&gt; However, I&#39;m a bit unclear how the links drive my appl=\r\nication state. Although, I guess that the application state would change wh=\r\nen navigating to a resource by dereferencing a link (HTTP URI).\n&gt; This is e=\r\nxplained in the introduction section of Principled Design of the Modern Web=\r\n Architecture[13]:\n&gt; \n&gt;     The name &quot;Representational State Transfer&quot; is i=\r\nntended to evoke an image of how a well-designed Web application behaves: a=\r\n network of Web pages forms a virtual state machine allowing a user to prog=\r\nress through the application by selecting a link or submitting a short data=\r\n-entry form, with each action resulting in a transition to the next state o=\r\nf the application by transferring a representation of that state to the use=\r\nr.\n\nRight, that&#39;s my understanding too. \nWith most current applications the=\r\n state that&#39;s needed is fairly trivial. The primary Web application, the br=\r\nowser, only usually deals with a handful of resources at a time. Even with =\r\nthings like proxies, aggregators, spider-based agents etc, the interactions=\r\n are individually very simple, it&#39;s just there are a lot more of them going=\r\n on concurrently.\n\nOn the other hand I suspect SW/LD applications are likel=\r\ny to be a lot more demanding in terms of complexity of state. A representat=\r\nion of a resource (plus HTTP headers) can contain a lot more resource-relat=\r\ned machine-usable information than an opaque blob or even a HTML document w=\r\nith hrefs.\n\nThe water around Web applications has been muddied somewhat by =\r\nsystems that rely on server-side state and coupling to the client: &quot;I can&#39;t=\r\n do that without cookies&quot;, and RPC still pops up here and there, however di=\r\nsguised. \n(Aside: I&#39;d be interested in pointers to material that walks the =\r\nreader from this mindset to something more RESTful). \n\nBut with SW/LD apps =\r\nwe kind-of have a chance to start from year zero and do things *right*. The=\r\n links you provided and the Linked Data Patterns book [1] are good steps in=\r\n this direction (as hopefully so so too the Linked Data book [2]).\n\n&gt; State=\r\nless Interaction is not really covered by the Linked Data principles as def=\r\nined by timbl[9], or? Although, when realizing &quot;state as a resource&quot; (cf. [=\r\n15]), I can use again the common knowledge representation languages of the =\r\nSemantic Web as basis for describing states and using HTTP URIs to make the=\r\nse resources also accessible.\n\nYes - although the &quot;transparency&quot; here is no=\r\nt so obvious.\n\n&gt; Would you agree with (parts of) my interpretation?\n\nGenera=\r\nlly, yes.\n\n&gt; Finally, are the principles of Linked Data really only intende=\r\nd to be read-only. I though read and write would better fit to the principl=\r\nes of REST, or?\n\nA very good point. Read, write and the other operations co=\r\nvered by HTTP methods should ideally be a core part of LD/SW systems from t=\r\nhe get-go (otherwise things will be a bit boring!). \n\nIt has taken the Web =\r\nquite a while to get more read/write despite the capability being there fro=\r\nm the start. CMSs and blogging tools, things like Twitter and Facebook do h=\r\nelp extend the media from broadcast to peer (few publishers/many consumers =\r\n-&gt; many publishers/many consumers). Even within these useful systems there =\r\nare various Web anti-patterns, most notably the closed data silo as opposed=\r\n to linked open data (LOD, [3]).\n\n(heh, speaking of which I might well repo=\r\nst this mail on my blog, or at least tweet it...)\n\nHopefully, thanks to the=\r\n explosion in publication of RDFa - 3.6% of webpages now contain RDFa [4] -=\r\n we will soon be seeing a lot more diverse use made of the technologies fro=\r\nm folks that aren&#39;t coming straight from the traditional (incomprehensible =\r\n;) SW/LD communities. \n\nThere may well also be some more useful infrastruct=\r\nure subsystem bits (akin to those described by Fielding in his thesis) enab=\r\nled by RESTful HTTP + semweb tech. For example, an RDF store (server- or cl=\r\nient-side) is essentially a cache of a little chunk of the Web of Data. A S=\r\nPARQL endpoint offers an efficient mode of access to that cache. Going one =\r\nstep further, a generic intelligent linked data proxy could be composed thi=\r\ns way.\n\nThe current generation of mainstream RDF/SW/LD applications seem to=\r\n be mostly limited either catalog-like systems (e.g. the drug DBs and the B=\r\nBC) or the augmentation of search (e.g. Yahoo! SearchMonkey and Google Rich=\r\n Snippets). Useful those these may be, they aren&#39;t exactly inspiring.\n\nGoin=\r\ng off-topic a little, I reckon the parts needed for a really useful, compel=\r\nling and *interesting* Web of data include:\n\n* improved linkage between dat=\r\na sets, to facilitate easier discovery\n* refactoring of traditional data-ba=\r\nsed activities to use (just-in-time) linked data\n* new user interface parad=\r\nigms to work with linked data\n* a lot more imagination!\n\nI reckon there&#39;s e=\r\nasily enough momentum to make progress down this track inevitable - the que=\r\nstion is what do we need to do to lubricate the wheels and move a bit faste=\r\nr.\n\nCheers,\nDanny.\n\n[1] http://patterns.dataincubator.org/book/\n[2] http://=\r\ntomheath.com/blog/2011/01/the-linked-data-book-draft-table-of-contents/\n[3]=\r\n http://esw.w3.org/SweoIG/TaskForces/CommunityProjects/LinkingOpenData\n[4] =\r\nhttp://tripletalk.wordpress.com/2011/01/25/rdfa-deployment-across-the-web/\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n"}}
