The following are only\nthose responses that seem solid:\n\n&gt; Okay, of course expiration counts should go both ways. The client should\n&gt; request one and the server should say what it decided upon.\n\nShort of having a bid/counterbid/countercounterbid process, which is too hard to\nimplement, my suggestion was that we just have\nbid/reject/bid-1/reject/bid-N/accept.\n\n&gt; Plus, HTTP (surprisingly!) doesn&#39;t really standardize how to report\n&gt; which expectation wasn&#39;t met. So how would you figure it out.\n\nyup!  way!  Extension status-codes are legal...  What is the cost of a new\nstatus code?  It seems completely reasonable to assume that a client which has\ninitiated a WATCH transaction would know how to understand related status codes.\nA 4xx code is the expected extension code, given that the 417 expectation\nimplies that.\n\n&gt; I think you misunderstood 14.20: &quot; The server MUST respond with a 417\n&gt; (Expectation Failed) status if any of the expectations cannot be met\n&gt; ..&quot;\n\nVery possible.  I find rfc 2616 not unlike ancient runes/nostradamus.\n\n\n&gt; &gt; * The &quot;subscription-expiration&quot; header is required.  Since it\n&gt; &gt; is reasonable that many requests will be on a &quot;good enough&quot; basis\n&gt; &gt; (&quot;do the watch for as long as is feasible&quot;), I suggest that this be\n&gt; &gt; the default value.  If there is a default value then there is no need\n&gt; &gt; to have an expiration request header be a MUST.\n&gt;\n&gt; It isn&#39;t a MUST. It&#39;s a MAY in the spec as it is:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;The message MAY contain a header called &quot;Requested-Expiration&quot;.&quot;\n\nSorry, no.  I have reloaded the page several times and it still says MUST.\n\n\n&gt; &gt; * I believe that this language overspecifies: &quot;The client MAY renew\n&gt; &gt; the subscription before this time. If it does not, the server MAY stop\n&gt; &gt; sending notifications after that time. The server MAY also remove the\n&gt; &gt; Subscription URI.&quot;  This behavior should be left to the implementation.\n&gt;\n&gt; Debatable...what&#39;s the point of standardizing the headers if we don&#39;t\n&gt; standardize the associated behaviour?\n\nThere is no point in either.  :)\n\nStandards are not a goal in themselves, and I am not convinced that\ncanonicalization is constructive at this early stage.  My feeling is that\nhttp://internet.conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/HttpEvents is part of an ongoing\nseries of thought experiments  regarding asynchronous design patterns in HTTP.\n\nSpecification is always destructive in that it reduces the available range of\nexpression.  Overspecifying is not a service.\n\n\n&gt; &gt; Expiration: The response to the Subscription MAY include a header\n&gt; &gt; called &quot;Subscription-Expiration&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Just one? I might want a year or twelve issues. Whichever comes first.\n\nhmm....   a relative date?  a compound expression?  need to mull this over.  I\nwould prefer to avoid this kind of negotiation, which leads inevitably to yet\nanother programming language.\n\n\n&gt; &gt; In the case of Expiration;adhoc, the server may cease performing the\n&gt; &gt; watch at any time.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would say that the Server needs to report its policy in the response.\n&gt; i.e. One Month, 12 requests, etc. Otherwise, how will the client know\n&gt; when it is time to renew?\n\nFor the most part it&#39;s not important.  Servers currently return 404 whenever it\npleases them.  For the same reasons watches should be assumed to go until they\nstop.\n\n- Lucas\n\n\n\n"}}
