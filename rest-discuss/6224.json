The URI in a\n&gt; &gt; POST request identifies =\r\nthe resource that will handle the enclosed\n&gt; &gt; entity. That resource might =\r\nbe a data-accepting process, a gateway to\n&gt; &gt; some other protocol, or a sep=\r\narate entity that accepts annotations. In\n&gt; &gt; contrast, the URI in a PUT re=\r\nquest identifies the entity enclosed with\n&gt; &gt; the request -- the user agent=\r\n knows what URI is intended and the\n&gt; &gt; server MUST NOT attempt to apply th=\r\ne request to some other resource.\n&gt; &gt; If the server desires that the reques=\r\nt be applied to a different URI,\n&gt; &gt; it MUST send a 301 (Moved Permanently)=\r\n response; the user agent MAY\n&gt; &gt; then make its own decision regarding whet=\r\nher or not to redirect the\n&gt; &gt; request.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; And then I was enlightened=\r\n :)\n&gt;\n&gt; Multiple views of the same object Sandeep?\n&gt; The above (to me) look=\r\ns almost like an application layer decision,\n&gt; with overtones of Elliottes =\r\nperspective.\n&gt;\n&gt; It would appear that the amend vs create view is just a bi=\r\nt\n&gt; inappropriate, unless you take a very specific view.\n\nI guess Elliotte =\r\nis saying the same thing as that snippet from 2616.\nThe difference between =\r\nPUT and POST is not one of CREATE and UPDATE.\nThe primary difference is abo=\r\nut the relationship of the URI with the\nenclosed entity. In the case of PUT=\r\n, the URI identifies the enclosed\nentity whereas in the case of POST the UR=\r\nI identifies the resource\nthat will *process* the enclosed entity. This imp=\r\nlies that in the case\nof PUT the client decides the URI that is used to ide=\r\nntify the\nresource that is created/updated (given the right permissions) an=\r\nd in\nthe case of POST the server decides the URI that identifies the\nresour=\r\nce that gets created/updated, if it needs to, as a result of the\nPOST reque=\r\nst. Both methods can be used to CREATE or UPDATE resources,\nthe difference =\r\nis in how they do this. Also, POST can be used to do\nmore than just CREATE =\r\nor UPDATE resources, whereas PUT can only be\nused for those two operations.=\r\n\n\nSandeep Shetty\nhttp://sandeep.shetty.in\n\n"}}
