For example, it fixes the issue of message lifetimes being out\n&gt; of synch with process lifetimes; it supports dynamically determined routing\n&gt; paths; forwarders know to retry over some fairly long interval; via POP it has\n&gt; strong support for transient nodes; it has a reply-to header for activating\n&gt; callbacks; implementations already handle much longer message lifetimes by\n&gt; writing them to disk; it has POP3 to support the semantics of message stores; it\n&gt; has a broad deployed base of forwarders and temporary storage depots.\n\nTo me, none of those are specifically asynchronous issues.  They&#39;re\nmostly stateless issues.  And HTTP satisfies each of them (ok, we need a\nreply-to header - see below).  This is important because it explains why\nwhat I have below is so simple.\n\n&gt; &gt; For the record, I&#39;m all for introducing asynchronous notifications into\n&gt; &gt; HTTP.  I&#39;ll just refrain from suggesting how it should be done until I\n&gt; &gt; understand what you&#39;re asking, lest I confuse things by introducing a\n&gt; &gt; solution too early.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please do introduce and suggest.\n\nLet me start by saying that REST, like all architectures, works by\nplacing restrictions on component interaction.  The fundamental REST\nrestriction is that interactions are limited to semantics that apply\nto things with identity, aka resources.\n\nSo the question is (assuming we&#39;ve already decided we need asynch 8-),\nwhen do things with identity need to send event notifications?\n\nThe answer that KnowNow came up with is &quot;When they change state&quot;.  I\nhaven&#39;t kept up with what they&#39;ve been implementing, but I recall\ntalking with Rohit about a &quot;WATCH&quot; method (Roy suggested the name).\n\nIt works this way (I&#39;m not saying KnowNow does this, only this is\nhow it could work - there may be better ways too, but the request\nline won&#39;t change);\n\nWATCH http://www.yahoo.com HTTP/1.1\nReply-To: http://mysite.org/yahoo-watch\n\nThis is a request to the resource to notify the Reply-To URI (via POST)\nwhen www.yahoo.com changes state.  *What* the notification looks like\nis up for grabs, there are lots of possibilities and the request can\nbe configured to ask for something specific (e.g. a delta encoding,\njust the URI, a full representation, etc..).\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
