So we probably all have to find a good tradeoff=\r\n depending on our particular contexts. For example, in my current project I=\r\n have considered using XForms for my hypermedia controls, but it would have=\r\n been too much complex for the teams in charge of implementing clients. I s=\r\nettled for HTML forms, which are less powerful but easier to use. \nTo get b=\r\nack to URI templates, now that I can provide tooling to some of the client =\r\ndevelopers, they could become a worthwhile addition.\n\nPutting aside the pro=\r\nblem of dynamically communicating allowable values for expansion (let&#39;s pro=\r\ngress one step at a time), I like your idea of &lt;a rel=3D&quot;circle&quot; hreft=3D&quot;/=\r\ncircle/radius;{radius}&quot; /&gt;. As the hreft attribute isn&#39;t standard XHTML we =\r\nwould have to get it from our own namespace. This would give:  &lt;a rel=3D&quot;ci=\r\nrcle&quot; my:hreft=3D&quot;/circle/radius;{radius}&quot; /&gt;\n\nHowever it looks like it bre=\r\naks the HTML 5 specification which states: &quot;The target, rel, media, hreflan=\r\ng, and type attributes must be omitted if the href attribute is not present=\r\n.\n\nWe could mint a new rel attribute in our own namespace, which would give=\r\n: &lt;a my:rel=3D&quot;circle&quot; my:hreft=3D&quot;/circle/radius;{radius}&quot; /&gt;\n\nAt that poi=\r\nnt however, I wonder if using &lt;a&gt; still makes much sense. What do you think=\r\n?\nAn alternative is to create a new element. If we name it &quot;link&quot;, an XHTML=\r\n representation containing this element would look like:\n\n&lt;html xmlns=3D&quot;ht=\r\ntp://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; xmlns:my=3D&quot;http://www.example.com/my&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;body=\r\n&gt;\n    &lt;my:link rel=3D&quot;circle&quot; hreft=3D&quot;/circle/radius;{radius}&quot;  /&gt;\n  &lt;/bod=\r\ny&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nWhat is your take on this? Can we do better?\n\nPhilippe\n\n--- In =\r\nrest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Mike Kelly &lt;mike@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On Wed, Nov =\r\n9, 2011 at 7:40 PM, Eric J.
