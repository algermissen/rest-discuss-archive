The RDF model can be\n&gt; &gt; serialized into many syntaxes to make in-line integration easier.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, that&#39;s of course true. Here is why I think of it as in-line versus\n&gt; out-of-line: I am an XML person and I think that syntax matters. One of\n&gt; my complaints about SOAP is that it (and XLink, for that matter) is that\n&gt; it introduces a foreign syntax into XML vocabularies and thus makes them\n&gt; harder to teach and learn. That impacts their adoption characteristics.\n&gt; \n&gt; Out-of-line, I can stand RDF&#39;s syntax because that is really what it is\n&gt; optimized for: pointing into resources and making assertions about them.\n&gt; But inline, I can hardly imagine ever doing this:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;rdf:RDF&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;rdf:Description about=&quot;#&quot;&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;s:Creator&gt;Ora Lassila&lt;/s:Creator&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rather than:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;Creator&gt;Ora Lassila&lt;/Creator&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I think that this sort of disagreement was behind the RSS conflict and\n&gt; branch.\n&gt; \n&gt; Likely the right way to merge the worlds is to have a sort of RDF\n&gt; stylesheet which maps from XML into the RDF model. I would associate\n&gt; that with my document through a processing instruction. I believe the\n&gt; FourThought guys were working on such a technique.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; What RDF provides is a generalized assertion model.  That means that an\n&gt; &gt; RDF client can build up an understanding of a piece of representational\n&gt; &gt; state in an incremental manner, rather than the all-or-nothing approach\n&gt; &gt; of XML, where you either do or do not understand a schema.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s certainly valuable but in my personal opinion, most XML users\n&gt; will not be willing to pay the price of designing their vocabularies\n&gt; specifically for RDF compatibility.  For instance I much prefer the\n&gt; syntax of the real WSDL to the one outlined here:\n&gt; \n&gt;  * http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/ws-rdf/\n\nQuite dated, this is.  I wrote it back in 2000, before I came to the\nsame conclusion as you have: that it&#39;s more important to have mapping\nfeatures from XML to RDF than to squeeze everything into RDF syntax.\n\n\n&gt; For one thing, the idea of making one of the top-most elements &quot;rdf:RDF&quot;\n&gt; rather goes against the design of almost every XML schema language I&#39;ve\n&gt; ever seen.\n\nYou might, then, want to check out the updated article:\n\nhttp://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-wsdlrdf/\n\nUnfortunately, there is a bug in this article I&#39;ve reported to the\neditor.
