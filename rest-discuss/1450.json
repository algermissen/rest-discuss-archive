What does that look\nlike with an Axis client. What does it look like with an Axis server.\nWhat does the WSDL look like? Everybody is pointing out that this is\npossible in theory but nobody has sat down to document how to do this in\npractice. It isn&#39;t a matter of convincing REST advocates that SOAP is\nRESTful. It&#39;s more a matter of bolstering the claim of SOAP advocates\nthat SOAP can use the Web as more than a transport pipe *in practice*.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
