But that doesn&#39;t feel quite right,\n&gt; almost as if I&#39;m abusing POST.\n\nCollection is a type of resource once you take an &quot;everything is a \nresource&quot; view.\n\nRepresentation of a collection is therefore a valid thing to POST.\n\nAs such it doesn&#39;t seem like abusing POST to POST a representation of a \ncollection to a resource that handles such collections. Quite the \nobvious approach in fact.\n\nNow, if it makes good conceptual sense to identify that batch with its \nown batch identifier (by which I mean, it makes sense within your model \nto do so, particularly if you might want to retrieve information about \nthat batch at a later date) AND if it makes good sense for the client to \ndetermine the identifier, then you&#39;ve got something where PUT also makes \nsense and is probably actually better.\n\nOtherwise I&#39;d POST.\n\n\n"}}
