The second GET changes the state of\n&gt; &gt; the transaction.  In particular, the result of the\n&gt; &gt; GET is that the transaction may fail may cause the\n&gt; &gt; subsequent sequence of actions to fail (if URI1\n&gt; &gt; changes before the second PUT).\n&gt;\n&gt; Nope.  As far as I can tell, you are just inventing transaction\n&gt; semantics that don&#39;t exist.  Transaction success or failure\n&gt; depends on whether the server can cause the combined state change\n&gt; requested by those requests, as a whole, to take effect on the\n&gt; server as a result of the commit.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; ....Roy\n&gt;\n\n"}}
