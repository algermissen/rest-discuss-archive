They say, &quot;Hey \nAlan, where do you find your April statement on this site?&quot;  So you \nbookmark that page and send the URL to them.  They try it and it asks \nfor authentication info.  They enter theirs and are denied.\n\nNow, one might argue that they could find their own statement by \nreplacing &quot;alan.dean&quot; with their name.  But this person isn&#39;t bright \nenough to manipulate URLs.\n\nHow do you handle this?  Perhaps \nhttp://example.com/bank/statements/200604/ would take them to a page \nwhich let them type in their authentication info, and redirect them to \ntheir personal page.\n\nBut suppose you weren&#39;t savvy enough to know that.  Maybe there might be \na link on your personal page to the generic page, which says &quot;send this \nlink to a friend&quot;?\n\n-- \nLyle Kopnicky\nSoftware Project Engineer\nVeicon Technology, Inc.\n\n\n"}}
