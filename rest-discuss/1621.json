What happens if the second &quot;hop&quot; fails?\n&gt; The third &quot;hop?&quot;  What should the client see?  What *can* the client know\n&gt; about those failures?  What are the semantics of chained HTTP responses?\n&gt; One might argue that this is nothing more than the current chained proxy\n&gt; scenario, but once you introduce additional filtering / operational\n&gt; semantics in the intermediaries it becomes much more (IMO untenably)\n&gt; complex.  Proxies work because they&#39;re (more or less) transparent;  the\n&gt; entire purpose of the intermediaries in the above is to perform some\n&gt; function.\n\nNo, it&#39;s actually quite straightforward.  We spent lots of time checking\nthis.  It works great, with very simple rules.  A client only cares\nabout the request, but debugging can occur with the Via header if\nrequired.\n\nBasically, if you use the SOAP processing model, which encapsulates\nproper behaviour for any intermediary, you&#39;re good.\n\n&gt; But all this is just explanatory overkill:  just think\n&gt; \n&gt;   research!ucbvax!dagobah!td\n&gt; \n&gt; and *shudder.*\n\nThe implementation was crappy, but the theory was good.  I&#39;m with Rohit\non this.  I think you&#39;ll see bang paths again.\n\nMark &quot;uunet|tsltor!markb&quot; Baker\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
