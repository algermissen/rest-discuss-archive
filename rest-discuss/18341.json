understanding. and where does this understanding exist? only (and\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; solely) in the head of humans?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; after careful review, i claim you wi=\r\nll find that there *are*\n&gt;&gt; real-world markers, indicators, semantic &quot;switc=\r\nhes&quot; that exist in the\n&gt;&gt; real world; ones that are recognized, parsed, and=\r\n (when appropriate)\n&gt;&gt; activated by humans. Currently, thesemarkers are the=\r\n visual cues that\n&gt;&gt; are rendered by common Web browsers via the messages s=\r\nent by servers\n&gt;&gt; in the most ubiquitous human-centered hypermedia format o=\r\nf the day;\n&gt;&gt; HTML.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Semantic meaning&quot; is an emergent property. In th=\r\ne case of HTML that\n&gt;&gt; property is &quot;created&quot; by humans when they observe th=\r\ne visual\n&gt;&gt; &quot;landscape&quot; rendered by =A0Web browsers.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Does anyone here=\r\n want to assert that this &quot;semantic meaning&quot; can\n&gt;&gt; _only_ emerge when huma=\r\nns are *directly* involved in the real-time\n&gt;&gt; interpretation of messages t=\r\nhat contain these (or similar) markers?\n&gt;\n&gt; Afaict, there&#39;s a spectrum of s=\r\nophistication here. I haven&#39;t seen a\n&gt; client implementation which demonstr=\r\nates automated capabilities which\n&gt; come &#39;close&#39; to that of a human, we&#39;re =\r\nbasically talking about the\n&gt; web&#39;s version of a Turing Test.\n&gt;\n&gt; Most of t=\r\nhe evidence so far suggests this is the case, although I am\n&gt; not an AI exp=\r\nert.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Or\n&gt;&gt; is it possible that humans can &quot;code&quot; agents to have (at le=\r\nast some\n&gt;&gt; of) this same ability to recognize, parse, and activate the\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&quot;affordances&quot; found in the hypermedia landscape?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It is my assertion t=\r\nhat the latter is the case. I also contend that\n&gt;&gt; making the assumption th=\r\nat this is possible is a key step in advancing\n&gt;&gt; the art and theory of dis=\r\ntributed hypermedia.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I think it&#39;s an interesting research topic but =\r\nthe complexity of\n&gt; producing these sorts of clients is so high, it&#39;s inevi=\r\ntable that only\n&gt; a small portion of your client base will behave this way =\r\n(unless you\n&gt; control them all, in which case your system is not very distr=\r\nibuted!).\n&gt; So, in practice, you will be forced to only evolve your applica=\r\ntion in\n&gt; a way that caters to the lowest common denominator - undermining =\r\nthe\n&gt; effort that has gone into more sophisticated clients. This is a big\n&gt;=\r\n challenge to overcome in and of itself, irrespective of the challenge\n&gt; of=\r\n inventing the designs for such an autonomous hypermedia agent.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,=\r\n\n&gt; Mike\n\n"}}
