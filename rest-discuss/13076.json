I have one  \n&gt; part of my design right now where I&#39;m unsure what a good RESTful  \n&gt; approach would be.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have resources that support GET and PUT, but contain some parts  \n&gt; that clients are not allowed to modify. (This doesn&#39;t seem like an  \n&gt; uncommon case; I would think that navigation links, for example,  \n&gt; would typically not be modifiable in a PUT.) So is it better to:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. Require clients to submit all the read-only parts unmodified in a  \n&gt; PUT, and respond with an error code if they are absent or altered?\n&gt; 2. Take advantage of the leniency allowed in a server&#39;s  \n&gt; implementation of PUT to ignore the read-only elements (or their  \n&gt; absence)?\n&gt; 3. Separate read-only elements into a sub-resource that only  \n&gt; supports GET? (This may not be feasible for resources which must be  \n&gt; created as a whole.)\n&gt;\n&gt; or something else?\n&gt;\n&gt; Second, there are some elements that are modifiable or not depending  \n&gt; on the privileges held by the (authenticated) user. I would think  \n&gt; this would be expressed by a difference in the representation  \n&gt; returned to the client, but what should that difference be? (My  \n&gt; representations are XML documents, if there isn&#39;t a more general  \n&gt; solution.)\n&gt;\n&gt; And in a broader sense, I&#39;d like the client to know which elements  \n&gt; of the resource the user can modify, for presentation purposes. Is  \n&gt; there a generally accepted way to do this, perhaps with form  \n&gt; templates or XForms?\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d be interested in any comments or alternative approaches, if I&#39;m  \n&gt; just looking at it from the wrong angle.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt;  -- Jim\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
