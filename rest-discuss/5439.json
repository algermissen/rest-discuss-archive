But you cannot use PUT, POST and DELETE in\nthat interface.\n\nThere is nothing that says you must organise resources hierarchically,\nalthough many people prefer to do so. There are advantages to separating\nyour containment hierarchies from your components. It makes it trivial\nto add new containers and the containers can accept search parameters.\nUsing the http://example.org/widget URI for creating new widgets is\nsimilar to the Prototype design pattern while still adhering to the\nexpected behaviour of a POST, ie. create a subordinate resource.\n\nDonald.\n\n\n\n                                                                           \n                                                                           \n                                                                           \n                                                                           \n\n\n\n\nHi all,\n\nHere&#39;s a question I&#39;d like to put to the list.\n\nSay I have a RESTful system for modelling my ever growing collection of\nwidgets. I have a bunch of resources representing my widgets and another\nresource providing a list of my widgets. The list contains the URLs for\neach widget so a client can move from the list to an individual widget.\nSo far so good. An XML representation of the list might look something\nlike this:\n\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;widgets&gt;\n    &lt;widget name=&quot;Foo widget&quot; href=&quot;http://example.org/widgets/1&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;widget name=&quot;Bar widget&quot; href=&quot;http://example.org/widgets/2&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/widgets&gt;\n\nTo add a new widget to my system, I POST a representation of my new\nwidget to my list resource, it processes the representation, creates a\nnew widget resource and appends it to its list. Great, but here&#39;s the\nquestion:\n\nShould my list representation provide a clue to this POST operation? For\nexample:\n\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;widgets\n    xmlns=&quot;http://example.org/widgetsystem&quot;\n    xmlns:formlang=&quot;|http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml|&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;widget name=&quot;Foo widget&quot; href=&quot;http://example.org/widgets/1&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;widget name=&quot;Bar widget&quot; href=&quot;http://example.org/widgets/2&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;formlang:form action=&quot;http://example.org/widgets&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;\nenctype=&quot;widgetsystem/widget&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/widgets&gt;\n\nIf not, how does a client know it can POST a representation of a new\nwidget resource to it, is this just an expected part of a RESTful system?\n\nIf so, using some kind of forms language, does this also mean that I\nneed to do this for every resource and method in my system, so should\neach representation of my widgets include some forms stuff saying what\nto PUT to update it?\n\nPaul.\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
