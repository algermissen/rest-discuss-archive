Would it be acceptable\n&gt; to end up at the end with &quot;/container&quot; still existing, but empty?\n\nExisting but empty. Hmm. What does the representation of an empty \ncontainer look like? Does it even have a representation? I&#39;d say that if \nit has a representation then this would be somewhat confusing, but not \naltogether wrong; it would be as if the container had magically been \ncreated immediately after deletion.\n\nThis sounds like an implementation convenience question - is the \nrequirement to provide a simple way of deleting all the contained \nresources. I&#39;d suggest an alternative container which also contains all \nthe resources\n\n/container?id=*\n\nThen you could DELETE this, which would also delete all the contained \nresources. But you would not have removed the /container resource. Any \nfurther requests to /container?id=* at this point should get 404 Not \nFound (or is 410 Gone better?), until the /container is non empty.\n\nThis seems clearer to me because I get the behaviour I&#39;d expect on the \nalternative container - when DELETED it is gone. And the /container \nresource is still there, ready to accept POST (or whatever really) in \nthe future.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt; seairth@...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; *Yahoo!
