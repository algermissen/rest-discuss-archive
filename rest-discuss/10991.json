W=\r\nho would have thought that we could\n&gt; &gt; invent a new attack vector so easil=\r\ny!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Security issues aside, there are quite some obstacles when\n&gt; &gt; d=\r\noing *cross-server* copying.\n&gt;\n&gt; There is no reason any server has to proce=\r\nss GETPUTs that would\n&gt; involve an actual over-the-network HTTP GET. If I w=\r\nrote server\n&gt; code to handle GETPUT I certainly wouldn=92t support real GET=\r\ns. All\n&gt; I would do is run the URI and supplied headers through the\n&gt; dispa=\r\ntcher to see whether the client could use this request to\n&gt; GET an applicat=\r\nion object for which I support copying or moving,\n&gt; then create an alias fo=\r\nr the object internally.\n&gt;\n\nFollowing redirects? Having the cookies for tha=\r\nt namespace on your  \nserver? Etc. I understand that you want to resolve th=\r\ne URI only in  \nyour very own application namespace and forbid everything e=\r\nlse. Could  \nwork.\n\nRegarding PUT semantics: creating an &quot;alias&quot; (I interpr=\r\net this as  \nsome kind of symbolic internal link/bind) would break it if yo=\r\nur app  \nuses content-negotiation. A PUT JPEG stays a JPEG, but an aliased =\r\napp  \nobject will not. And if you do not use content negotiation, supplying=\r\n  \nthe URI for a &quot;COPY/BIND&quot; would suffice. No headers needed, or?\n\n&gt; That =\r\nmeans that in some cases I would actually support inter-host\n&gt; copying, eg.=\r\n from img.blog1.example.com to img.blog2.example.com,\n&gt; where both blogs be=\r\nlong to the same user who can therefore supply\n&gt; correct auth credentials f=\r\nor both.\n&gt;\n\nIf you think along the lines of &quot;aliasing&quot; (BIND) or duplicatin=\r\ng  \napplication objects (COPY), the WebDAV methods seem better suited  \n(al=\r\nthough they sometimes get the target uri wrong way around, I agree).\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nAdmittedly, there are lots of scenarios where these issues do\n&gt; &gt; not come =\r\nup. But perhaps its worth to take another look at why\n&gt; &gt; the client cannot=\r\n do the GET+PUT itself?\n&gt;\n&gt; Because they have already uploaded a copy of th=\r\nat 7.3 GB file and\n&gt; don=92t want to download and re-upload it, particularl=\r\ny since the\n&gt; service bills for bandwidth?\n&gt;\n\nIf I have posted this large r=\r\nesource and have a URI for it, why would  \nI need to simulate another POST =\r\nfor it in ATOM? Seems something  \nmissing in the protocol in that case. Cou=\r\nld you elaborate?\n\nCheers,\n\nStefan\n--\n&lt;green/&gt;bytes GmbH, Hafenweg 16, D-48=\r\n155 M=FCnster, Germany\nAmtsgericht M=FCnster: HRB5782\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
