This would make it impossible to discover services\n&gt; at runtime or to replace existing services. In both cases, the client could\n&gt; only be implemented by inspecting the service.\n\nIf you understand the media type and it&#39;s semantics, and have an\nendpoint, then you should have enough to leverage the service.\n\nA media type will convey semantics, unless you&#39;re using something generic.\n\nFor example, you can get an Atom Feed document from a service that\ndoesn&#39;t support AtomPub. But if you get an AtomPub Service document,\nthen anything that document leads you to can be expected to understand\nthe semantics of the AtomPub protocol.\n\nHow do you know you can get an AtomPub Service document from a URL?\n\nSomeone gave you the endpoint, or you went through some other\ndiscovery service that publishes and aggregates such things (using\ntheir own media types and semantics).\n\nNot every media type participates in a single protocol, so you can&#39;t\nnecessarily assume anything just because you found an endpoint, and\nthat endpoint responds with a certain payload.\n\nAs for not being able to implement a client without a service, that&#39;s\nnot necessarily true. You can implement a client using the\nspecification. I can theoretically go out and write an AtomPub client\nright now using the RFC and AP spec.\n\nCan I TEST it? No. But, I can&#39;t test the server without some kind of\nclient either.\n\nOnce you have a spec compliant AtomPub client, it should ideally be\ncompatible with any AtomPub endpoint.\n\nAnd AtomPub and Atom are both extensible protocols, in that if any new\nelements are added, they are, by specification, to be skipped over,\nbut retained by older clients. That allows the protocol to advance\nalong a certain axis, yet remain compliant, to some extent, with older\nclients.\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n(willh@...)\n\n"}}
