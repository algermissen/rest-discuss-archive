But I meet a\nproblem wh=\r\nen design my (hopefully) restful web service.\n\nMy website users can add boo=\r\nks or movies to their lists, with some\npredefined status (e.g. &quot;have read&quot;,=\r\n &quot;wish to watch&quot;, etc.) and\ncomments.  How can I let web service users to g=\r\net information like\n&quot;get all the books Bob wish to read, with his comments&quot;=\r\n?\n\nI think the resources in this case are not books, because comments are\nn=\r\not attributes of books.  They are attributes of the &quot;relationship of\nBob an=\r\nd the book&quot;.  Let me call the relationship &quot;collection&quot;.  So I\ndesigned the=\r\n following URLs and lost:\n\n/users/Bob/collections?cat=3Dbook&status=3Dwish\n=\r\n/users/Bob/collections/book/wish\n/users/Bob/collections/cat/book/status/wis=\r\nh\n/collections/user/Bob/cat/book/status/wish\n/collections?user=3DBob&cat=3D=\r\nbook&status=3Dwish\n\nWhich one do you consider the most &quot;RESTful&quot;?  I am com=\r\npletely lost. \nAnd I can not even judge to use &quot;users&quot; or &quot;user&quot; in the URL=\r\ns.  Anyone\ngive me a hint?  Thanks!\n\n\n"}}
