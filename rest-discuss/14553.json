All such tools will  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; be more than happy to oblige URI patterns and not media types.  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; This is not a media type problem, but a potential reality that  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Restbucks Inc. may need to account for.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Can you provide an example of the situation that made you change  \n&gt;&gt; your mind?\n&gt;\n&gt; Say, the server offers books and CDs with media types application/ \n&gt; vnd.book.myformat and application/vnd.cd.myformat. The task of an  \n&gt; ops engineer is to quickly come up with daily charts showing  \n&gt; requests/day for books and CDs, by sifting through access logs. It  \n&gt; is easy to implement this when the URIs used for these types of  \n&gt; resources have stable patterns.\n&gt;\n&gt; Let&#39;s say, you now want to run all CD sales (POST requests) through  \n&gt; a bigger box. URI patterns rule again.\n&gt;\n&gt; Both these are solvable based on media types, but when I design my  \n&gt; application such that some key factors are reflected in URIs (and a  \n&gt; few known media types), I get much more mileage out of the HTTP  \n&gt; toolstack. If I start folding these into an elaborate media type  \n&gt; scheme, I will be fighting with the toolstack to get it to work for  \n&gt; me. In the long run, it may even cost more to maintain such a system.\n\nHmm, without an intent to argue about the specific example, this  \nsounds a bit far fetched to me. The routing issue could be solved by  \nthe server itself by simply providing the clients with different  \ntarget URLs for CDs and books in the ordering form. This would also  \naddress the statistics issue (which I think is likely to be better  \nsolved by using the more sophisticated analytics engine of the backend  \nsystem anyway)\n\n&gt;\n&gt; In other words, media types (along with URIs, content encodings,  \n&gt; charset params etc.) keep representation visible to the protocol and  \n&gt; the toolstack. But that does not necessarily follow that media types  \n&gt; must be used to determine whether an incoming XML document is a book  \n&gt; or a CD. There are other (simpler) ways to determine such things.\n\nI think I do not understand why you argue that you cannot have both;  \nwhy you think you have to trade REST benefits for achieving the goals  \nyou describe. The coupling created by making particular URI patterns  \nknown to intermediaries for analytics and routing seems to be a heavy  \ntrade off. Especially since once it is established and figured out by  \nthe developers it will just spread all over the place. I&#39;d go a long  \nway to maintain URI opaqueness.\n\nMaybe I am not understanding you correctly, though.\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Subbu\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
