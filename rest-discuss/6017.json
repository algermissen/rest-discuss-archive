The \ngrammatical terms which are relevant are &#39;subject&#39;, &#39;verb&#39;, and &#39;object&#39;.\n\nThe subject is &#39;who&#39;. The verb is the &#39;action&#39;. The object is &#39;what&#39;.\n\n  (1)\n      Subject: Someone\n      Verb: Get\n      Object: A representation of the state of Joe&#39;s bank account.\n\n  (2)\n      Subject: Joe\n      Verb: Get\n      Object: A representation of the state of Joe&#39;s bank account.\n\n  (3)\n      Subject: Jim\n      Verb: Get\n      Object: A representation of the state of Joe&#39;s bank account.\n\nObviously HTTP and REST concern themselves with state transfer by way of \nrepresentations, so this is implicit. We can say:\n\n  (1)\n      Subject: Someone\n      Verb: Get\n      Object: Joe&#39;s bank account.\n\n  (2)\n      Subject: Joe\n      Verb: Get\n      Object: Joe&#39;s bank account.\n\n  (3)\n      Subject: Jim\n      Verb: Get\n      Object: Joe&#39;s bank account.\n\nWe can identify the &#39;object&#39; (i.e. the &#39;what&#39;) with a URI:\n\n   http://www.example.org/account/joe\n\nUsing HTTP Auth we can infer the subject. I.e. &#39;Someone&#39; means we can&#39;t \nsay exactly who. &#39;Joe&#39; means the user authenticated as Joe. &#39;Jim&#39; means \nthe user authenticated as Jim.\n\nThis is a valuable conceptualisation as it stands. However, this \nconceptualisation will lead you to realise that the ideal &#39;subject&#39; is \nnot in fact a &#39;user&#39;. Rather, a &#39;user session&#39; is better. This is \nbecause without a &#39;user session&#39; all users who authenticate with your \nserver can only have one session in all time. Alternatively, in order to \nfacilitate &#39;session&#39; you need to indicate the session in the &#39;resource&#39;. \nThis is tantamount to putting a &#39;session context&#39; in the URI, and that \nis not desirable. (Breaks bookmarks, can lead to insecure URLs which \ncan&#39;t be shared, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
