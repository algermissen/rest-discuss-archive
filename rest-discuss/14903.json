I mean, what benefit should it actually bringt? If I want my server to send an email, what would be wrong to say that I must do a POST to the &quot;http://.../mail-outbox/&quot; URI, which in turn will make the server send away the received entity as an email, and which ist a RESTful operation\n\nNothing is wrong with that. That is how domain specific operations (&#39;goals&#39; if you want) are achieved: tell a resource *with the appropriate semantics* to process-this (POST). So, if you learned from some hypermedia that http://.../mail-outbox/ has the semantics of sending a mail when you POST something to it then that is how you achieve that domain goal.\n\nThe need for the hypermedia is there because that is how the client learns ar runtime that http://.../mail-outbox/ has these semantics.\n\nNote: if the general semantics of the domain operation map to PUT or DELETE or PATCH these specific methods should be used because you get more visibility compared to POST (which has visibility zero). For example, a PUT on /orders/2 allows caches to flush what they have for /orders/2 and store the response to the PUT. If you POST /orders/2 the caches just flush - and they only do this not because they know what is going on but because that is the (necessary) default behavior for POST.\n\nJan\n\n\n\n&gt; (nobody says that CRUD means that a resource must be persistent *forever*, so the server is free to DELETE it on it&#39;s own once the mail is sent).
