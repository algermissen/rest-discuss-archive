I think my misleading assumption was, that a client can be =\r\ndynamically tought by the server to construct a message by sending a HTML F=\r\norm.\n&gt; \n&gt; While a real user would know from the web application context, wh=\r\nere to place his name and adress, how could a machine do that?  \n\nHi Jakob,=\r\n\n\nIt is quite RESTful to actually use HTML forms to dynamically instruct no=\r\nn human clients how to constructs URLs. So I don&#39;t think you were mislead i=\r\nn the first place. The client has to know (e.g, from documentation) things =\r\nlike where to put the name, the address and so on, but it also gets dynamic=\r\nally from the form many information on how to construct the URL: the scheme=\r\n, host and path can be communicated by the form&#39;s action attribute and the =\r\nquery string parameter names can be given by the form&#39;s &quot;input&quot; elements (f=\r\nor example, the documentation might state &quot;The actual name of the query par=\r\nameter for the address is given by the form&#39;s input element with an id attr=\r\nibute equals to &#39;address&#39; &quot;). \nHTML forms are not as powerful as some other=\r\n hypermedia controls (e.g., form-derived URLs are always based on query str=\r\nings) but are often used because they are easy to interpret client-side, an=\r\nd thus might constitute an acceptable compromise between support for hyperm=\r\nedia and actual usability.\nIf/when we get good client libraries for URI tem=\r\nplates, XForms or other wonders, this might change.\n\nThe usefulness of a te=\r\nxt/form+html media type is another question, though.\n\nPhilippe\n"}}
