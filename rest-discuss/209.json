It&#39;s a grab\nbag of methods, uri, headers, content, query terms, uri &#39;parameters&#39; (where\ndid those come from?), and so on. &quot;Get any little piece wrong&quot;, we say to\nourselves, &quot;and kiss interoperability and scalability goodbye&quot;. Sure, there\nmay be a &#39;good&#39; way of doing it, but there is no clear right or wrong and\nmultiple independent attempts will arrive at different results.\n\nI don&#39;t think it is just that we are unfamiliar with HTTP, or even that we\nare unfamiliar with the concepts of ReST, but I think trying to take a model\n(pub/sub or rdbms or whatever) map it to another model (ReST) and at the\nsame time map it to a &#39;wire format&#39; - something gets lost in the\ntranslation.\n\nI don&#39;t see a trend for web applications converging on common approaches of\nusing HTTP for a lot of cases, because most web applications talk to\nthemselves - the only interoperation is through a link and a GET. They can\nput data in any slot without breaking anything because they wrote both the\nclient and the server. Look at the many ways of doing user login - almost\nnone of them use HTTP security constructs - and things still work.\n\nThrough the discussion on this form I&#39;ve learned a /lot/ about designing\nwith HTTP. There may be compromises to that design to work with existing\ninfrastructure (browsers, asp/jsp, etc.), as well as further compromises to\nachieve some measure of end-user usability, but I&#39;m happy with what I&#39;ve\nlearned.\n\nSomething that would help me in the future is to model a large\ninformation-centric applications (including security and events) and create\na direct mapping into URIs and HTTP. If anybody has any thoughts or\nexperience with this, give me a shout. (The kind of thing I&#39;m thinking about\nis like an &#39;object oriented web&#39; but &#39;OO&#39; isn&#39;t appropriate. Components and\ninterfaces are closer. Entity-relationship from rdbms and OMT/UML notation\nis closer still.)\n\nMike\n\n\n\n"}}
