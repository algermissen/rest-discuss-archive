Having a p2p network on the HTTP level would not only solve a lot of existing communication problems of the Web, but also increase the number application-level functionalities exposed on the Web. Think of all the functionalities that are &quot;trapped&quot; on the client side, disconnected from the Web, although they originated from the Web by the means of navigating to a Web application.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I should shut up before someone publishes these ideas in a paper before I do. :)\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; + If you already haven&#39;t, you should check out Justin Erenkrantz&#39;s dissertation on CREST - http://www.erenkrantz.com/CREST/ which is an &quot;evolution&quot; of REST founded on *very* similar ideas.
