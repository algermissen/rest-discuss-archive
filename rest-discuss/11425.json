Each of those, as Ian says, can be\n&gt; implemented with a very simple server-side script. Yes, it&#39;s true  \n&gt; that this\n&gt; requires somebody to write the script...\n&gt;\n&gt; How exact can it be implemented on the server when the person  \n&gt; writing the\n&gt; HTML form is in control of the server? THAT&#39;s the primary use case.\n\nI suspect you meant to say when that person *isn&#39;t* in control of the  \nserver.\n\nIf so, I&#39;ve never been very swayed by the notion that people  \npublishing on geocities (or twitter or whatever else is the free  \nhosting / republishing provider of the moment is) should be able to  \nmake a fully-functional Web app using nothing but HTML and sticky  \ntape; see previous discussions about the cross-site access control  \nmechanism.\n\n\n&gt; In the case of someone being in control of the server it then  \n&gt; requires two\n&gt; round-trips and from what I know is that too many people priorize\n&gt; performance over everything else which means too many people simple  \n&gt; won&#39;t\n&gt; implement on their servers.\n\nPlenty of performance-sensitive sites use redirects to implement  \nvarious functions, and they&#39;re good enough despite their two round  \ntrips. Perfect, no, but good enough.\n\n\n&gt; Adding URI Templates to forms fills a large hole in the forms  \n&gt; architecture;\n\nUsing &quot;filling a hole in the architecture&quot; as a justification for  \ndoing something gives me the screaming heebee-jeebees, and I suspect  \nthat this attitude is why you&#39;re getting a fairly cold shoulder from  \nimplementers. Show them the real market need that you&#39;re filling and I  \nimagine you&#39;ll get a lot more of their attention.\n\n\n&gt; Mark Nottingham&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not the person to ask that, but frankly if you  \n&gt; want\n&gt; the functionality, go ahead and write the software, publish the site,\n&gt; release the browser plug-in; the standards will follow if the minds  \n&gt; do.\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s a non-sequitur; that&#39;s like telling me to build a natural-gas  \n&gt; powered\n&gt; car and expect that people will buy it when in fact there are not  \n&gt; enough\n&gt; natural-gas stations available. Your suggestion that the solution is  \n&gt; to\n&gt; write a browser plug-in is about like suggesting I just pound sand  \n&gt; although\n&gt; it is a bit less insulting. :-)\n\nI wasn&#39;t suggesting a plug-in for the cases you were talking about,  \nbut rather in general, if you have running code and demonstrated pain,  \nasking to put something into a standard is a lot more reasonable.\n\n\n&gt; No one will use the syntax until enough people have the plugin, and  \n&gt; nobody\n&gt; will install the plugin unless enough people are using the syntax;  \n&gt; it&#39;s a\n&gt; catch-22. This type of thing is where standards are needed in advance.\n\nThat is certainly how people often try to misuse standards, yes. Just  \nbecause something is a standard doesn&#39;t make it implemented or  \nsuccessful.\n\nTry what I did with hinclude &lt;http://www.mnot.net/javascript/hinclude/ \n &gt;; write a javascript library to handle a declarative syntax, and  \nhave it gracefully degrade once the browsers handle it natively. If  \nthe markup is declarative, it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s in HTML5 or not,  \nyou still can cater to unintended uses.\n\nOh, wait, I already did that: &lt;http://www.mnot.net/javascript/template_form.js \n &gt;.\n\nSure, you don&#39;t get the leverage of having it in a mature standard,  \nbut if it&#39;s truly a good idea, you&#39;ll be able to convince people to  \nuse it without that. The point is that you can&#39;t force a good idea on  \nthe market with a standard; people have to want to use it. I&#39;ve said  \nabout as much as I can about this without starting to babble about  \nstandards theory, so I think I&#39;ll stop now.\n\n--\nMark Nottingham     http://www.mnot.net/\n\n\n"}}
