As you yourself agree, there are at least\n&gt;&gt; two other semantics:  comparison (a form of deconstruction) and construction\n&gt;&gt; from relative URI.  So URI do *not* only support dereference;  it is\n&gt;&gt; necessary to look at the contents of the URI string in some contexts to gain\n&gt;&gt; the information necessary to use them the way they need to be used.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; .:, URI are not opaque in any sense consistent with the Axiom, and perhaps\n&gt;&gt; not opaque in any meaningful sense.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you read the whole document, Tim BL quotes both of these\n&gt; &quot;exceptions&quot;. A more formal exposition would put all of the things you\n&gt; can do with URIs together.\n\nNo confusion here, that&#39;s always been quite evident.\n\n&gt; But I&#39;ve always read the document as &quot;URIs\n&gt; are opaque with the exceptions listed in this document.&quot;\n\nAnd I agree that this is the intended interpretation.  BUT --- I disagree\nthat this interpretation is &quot;healthy&quot; for the overall architecture of the\nWeb.  The Axiom of Opacity is, historically, exactly and only a reaction to\nthe early and broken use of filename extensions in HTTP URI to determine\nfiletype.\n\nThe problem I have is that it goes to far.  A single axiom, particularly one\nas poorly stated and overly general as the one in question, constrains the\nentire architecture of the Web.\n\nSo the question is what&#39;s the &quot;real&quot; intent of the axiom?  Is it to\nconstrain the semantics of all URI, HTTP and otherwise, to the one (or two,\nor three...) operations explicitly called out?  Or is it to say that the\nsemantics of URI should be minimal, explicit, and universal --- and that URI\nshould not be used otherwise?\n\nIMO, in the absence of rationale for the former - in the absence of some\nkind of rigorous and compelling argument that demonstrates that indeed,\nthose three operations form a complete and expressive operational semantics\nfor all URI of all types - I prefer to assume the latter intent.  It\nprovides a framework of constraint without being overly or arbitrarily\nconstraining.\n\n&gt; My concern is\n&gt; that we not present these &quot;exceptions&quot; as evidence that the dam is\n&gt; leaking and therefore why not let all of the water in? A simple\n&gt; editorial change on Tim BLs part could turn those &quot;exceptions&quot; into just\n&gt; clearly described things you ARE allowed to do with URIs.\n\nBut in fact the dam is leaking, and it&#39;s not a matter of letting all the\nwater in.  It&#39;s a matter of fixing the leak.  The leak is the that, I\nbelieve, the Axiom doesn&#39;t achieve its true intent.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The only thing you can use an identifier for is to refer to an object.\n&gt; When you are not dereferencing, comparing or constructing absolute URIs\n&gt; from relative ones, you should not look at the contents of the URI\n&gt; string to gain other information...&quot;\n&gt; \n\nSo, are you talking about all URI or just HTTP URI?  If all URI, I&#39;ll tell\nyou that you&#39;re wrong to constrain things thus, because other applications\n*require* deeper semantics of names.\n\n&gt; Do you and I also agree that the specification for HTTP URIs does not\n&gt; allow you to infer that given:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://x.com/foo/bar\n&gt; \n&gt; that there is a resource &quot;http://x.com/foo&quot;?\n&gt;\n\nI do agree that the inference above is not a safe assumption in today&#39;s\nworld.  Whether or not that&#39;s a good or bad thing is open to debate and\nrationale / justification for such debate differs between applications.  In\nthe absence of specific knowledge that the provider x.com made such a\nguarantee, making this kind of an inference is a mistake.\n\n&gt; Okay, I can agree to that. But it&#39;s very different than giving people\n&gt; the advice that they should just do what they feel like when it comes to\n&gt; opacity. \n\nI think you&#39;re over-interpreting what I&#39;ve said.\n\n&gt; Until someone, somewhere defines other universal operators for\n&gt; URIs, as far as I know the only operations available are {deref,\n&gt; compare, construct-relative}. So for now, opacity &quot;you shouldn&#39;t do\n&gt; other stuff with URIs, or at least HTTP URIs.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; And of course there is an ambigious &quot;you&quot; in the formulation. &quot;You&quot;\n&gt; cannot include the entity (usually a server) responsible for mapping\n&gt; from URIs to real resources.\n\nWhat of an entity that maps URI into other URI according to some\nalgorithm...?\n\njb\n\n\n"}}
