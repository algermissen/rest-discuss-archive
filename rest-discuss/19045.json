Which application/json doesn&#39;t, meaning your example doesn&#39;t\nimplement REST.  Sure, you can serialize Atom as JSON or XML, but the\nresults aren&#39;t self-descriptive, which violates the uniform interface\nconstraint.\n\nThe fix is to define a JSON serialization of Atom and register\napplication/atom+json for it; in the meantime, it&#39;s important to\nunderstand where your system deviates from REST&#39;s idealized model.\nIt&#39;s become de rigeur to serialize Atom as JSON in this fashion, but it\ndoesn&#39;t meet Roy&#39;s definition of visibility, because everyone does it a\nlittle bit differently while visibility is a product of standardization.\n\nAll those similar efforts slap application/json on it, which is truly\nopaque because that media type doesn&#39;t define linking. Meaning the only\nway to deduce &quot;hey, this is Atom&quot; is by sniffing the content and making\nlots of assumptions about syntax.  Standardization is required for this\nto become visible; even then, proliferation is required before REST&#39;s\nbenefits would be fully realized.\n\nUsing REST as an evaluation tool in this manner, presents you with two\noptions:  one, re-architect the system, if you need the full benefits of\nREST from the get-go; or two, wait for the Web to catch up, participate\nin the standardization process by writing an I-D for the Atom WG.  I&#39;d\nsuggest, if you have to build your system this way, using a media type\nof application/x.atom+json until such time as standardization occurs.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
