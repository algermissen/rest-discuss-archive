It&#39;s sort of a quantum leap in complexity, to store off these\n&gt; temporary resources and age them out properly.\n\nHmm, to be clear, I was responding specifically to notion &quot;presumably I\nwould then have to do an operation to remove the portfolio once I have a\nresult, sort of a very primitive garbage collection operation&quot;, which I\ndon&#39;t think *must* be true: the server can manage its own resources.  I\ndon&#39;t consider it to be the &quot;quantum leap&quot; of complexity to age out\ntransient resources, but the systems I&#39;ve been working in recently have\nmade such things relatively easy.\n\n\nIt is a bigger jump from just using POST to do the analysis to doing a\nportfolio-POST + analysis-GET, but I don&#39;t know why you dismiss it as\n&quot;[just] conformance to some pattern&quot; ... all architectures and designs\nare conformance to a set of patterns.  It&#39;s not blind conformance, but\ninstead principled, done to achieve the advantages that the patterns\nenable and knowing the disadvantages concomitantly imposed.\n\nIf you&#39;re trying to operate under a strict interpretation of the HTTP\noperations -- as James&#39; original post (heh :) indicated -- then I think\nyou must exclude the &quot;process-this&quot; meaning of POST.  Also under that\ninterpretation, I don&#39;t see how one would get an analysis by anything\nother than GET.  In an ideal world there&#39;s nothing preventing the entire\nportfolio from being expressed in the GET, but there are practical\nissues with that (RFC2616 definition of GET, client software&#39;s\nURL-length handling, &c.).  An alternative, then, is to have the\nanalysis-GET further identify a just-POSTed portfolio resource.  Another\nalternative would be to POST a new analysis resource containing the\nportfolio data, then GET that new analysis.  I&#39;d consider those\nalternatives listed in terms of their &quot;bestness&quot; according to my\nworld-view, but &quot;best&quot; is always subjective, especially on open-ended\nproblems.\n\nIn any case, there are potentially practical benefits of the more\n&quot;complex&quot; versions, mostly around cache control of both the portfolio\nand analysis resources.  W.r.t. fundamentals, a portfolio that is a\nproper resource can be properly cached, conditionally retrieved, or\nitself be the output of some other process, &c.  W.r.t reusability, the\nportfolio resources are not tightly bound to the analysis, and can then\nbe used in other contexts.  W.r.t. evolvability, the facilities for both\ncreating and consuming portfolios can change independently of the\nanalysis operation, and vice-versa ... as well, the portfolio-related\nresources are then full resources in their own right, and can be moved,\nproxied, cached, &c.  Again, a less open-ended question might preclude\nsome of (the viability of) those possibilities.\n\nOf course, James&#39; primary concern might be implementation simplicity,\nwhich is probably going to trump all those things.\n\n...jsled\n-- \nhttp://asynchronous.org/ - `a=jsled; b=asynchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b}`\n\n"}}
