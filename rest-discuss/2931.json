(See\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/net_app_arch.htm#sec_\n2_1_1 for the distinction). \n\nSo a &quot;service&quot; is something that SOA toolkits hide behind a local proxy,\ntrying to shield as much as possible the fact that a message is going\nout over the network.  This is why an SOA based system needs to include\na interface definition language like WSDL.  This allows services to be\ndefined in a way that, for example, allows a Java based SOAP middleware\nproduct to present the service to the end user as a Java interface. \n\nThis isn&#39;t necessarily the case when using REST.  Of course you can\nalways wrap something around a RESTful network message to make it\ntransparent to the end user, but this isn&#39;t something that the\narchitecture itself tries to impose.    The interface to a resource is\nbaked into the system itself (e.g. HTTP&#39;s Get, Put, Post, Delete).\n\nTo summarize, one of the big differences is that a resource has an\ninterface that is defined by the architecture itself, while a service\nhas a user definable interface.\n\nToivo Lainevool\n\n\n\n"}}
