HTML browsers do this everyday (images, s=\r\ntylesheets,..).\n\n&gt;\n&gt; If yes, hateoas seems not feasible since the client ne=\r\neds a previous\n&gt; knowledge about what to look for in the list of links... (=\r\nunless there\n&gt; is only one link, of course)\n\nWhen the client receives text/=\r\nhtml and sees an &lt;img href=3D&quot;&quot;/&gt; it does  \nmake an assumption about the na=\r\nture of the target resource. In this  \ncase, that it is an image. The set o=\r\nf formats the client puts in the  \nAccept header when requesting the image =\r\nrepresentation (GET) is driven  \nby built-in knowledge which media types th=\r\ne client understands are  \nmedia types for images.\n\nThis gets a bit more in=\r\nteresting when the nature of the link target  \nimplies that there are other=\r\n links. When an AtomPub service document  \ncontains &lt;collection href=3D&quot;/co=\r\nls/1&quot;&gt; the client makes the assumption  \n(based on RFC5023) that /cols/1 is=\r\n a collection. The semantic of  \n&#39;collection&#39; includes the notion of having=\r\n a (possibly empty) set of  \nmembers. While the client should not make any =\r\nassumptions about the  \nexact media type the server will send for a GET to =\r\nthe collection, the  \nclient does make the assumption that whatever represe=\r\nntation it  \nreceives &#39;matches&#39; the collection nature.\n\nThe essential quest=\r\nion (for me anyway) is, on what basis the client  \npopulates the Accept hea=\r\nder when GETing /cols/1. RFC5023 sort of  \nmandates the server to return an=\r\n Atom feed, but from a REST POV (as  \nRoy rightly pointed out[1]) this is o=\r\nverly constraining. Have a look  \nat OpenSearch; nothing in the OpenSearch =\r\nset of specs tells the client  \ndeveloper what media types will be used for=\r\n search results (which are  \nessentially sets of links with metadata). But =\r\nfrom reading the  \ndocumentation a client developer learns that Atom feeds =\r\nand RSS feeds  \nare commonly used.\n\nClient and server not only need to unde=\r\nrstand the media types used for  \ncommunication, but they must share an und=\r\nerstanding of what media  \ntypes are used or can be expected to be used for=\r\n which kinds of  \nresources (&#39;kind of resource&#39; being implied by hypermedia=\r\n semantics).\n\n(I have agonized this list with this subject over the last we=\r\neks, so  \nyou might want to check those archives. The same on atom-protocol=\r\n: [2])\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; the question is: can I create my own relation semantics ? or s=\r\nhould I\n&gt; grasp in the available ones for Atom and Xhtml in case I want to\n=\r\n&gt; produce HATEOAS systems?\n\nOops - seems like you did not ask what I though=\r\nt you were asking. Sorry.\n\nYes, you create your own hypermdia semantics by =\r\ndefining media types  \n(or defining extensions for existing ones) or &#39;stand=\r\n-alone&#39; link  \nrelations. The more you can re-use existing ones the better,=\r\n but often  \nthese are just too unspecific. Before risking to accidentally =\r\nbaking  \nout-of-band knowledge into your clients and servers I&#39;d roll my ow=\r\nn  \nhypermedia.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; * I am trying to implement HATEOAS using Jersey.. I kn=\r\now it has no\n&gt; support out of the box, so I am designing some tricks here :=\r\n)\n\nAre you in a pure machine to machine scenario or is the client  \napplica=\r\ntion controlled by a human user?\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt;\n\n[1] http://www.imc.org/atom-prot=\r\nocol/mail-archive/msg11487.html\n[2] http://www.imc.org/atom-protocol/mail-a=\r\nrchive/msg11463.html\n\n\n&gt; regards,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    Felipe Ga=FAcho\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ----------=\r\n--------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
