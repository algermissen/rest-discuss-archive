I like\nregular expressions for this reason. it&#39;s a very simple engine that\nallows for a great deal of work to be done quickly and reliably. I\nlike XSLT for the same reason. Very little compiled code is needed in\norder to accomplish tasks. XSD has the same advantage, IMHO.\n\nI also view T-SQL as a useful engine for handling data. Typically, it\ntakes more resources to bootstrap T-SQL, but with the continued\ngrowith of small relational engines (ala Gears) this is still a very\nvaluable engine to leverage.\n\nAny time I can use an engine to complete a task, I&#39;ll do that before I\nstart to write script or code.  And right now the XML family offers a\ngreat number of useful engines. And I can count on consistent\nperformance on any platform and almost any language.\n\nMike A\n\nOn Dec 28, 2007 6:00 PM, Mike Schinkel &lt;mikeschinkel@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Stefan Tilkov wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Are there platforms that don&#39;t support XML?\n&gt;\n&gt; Many language platforms that I am aware of cannot load XML as an object\n&gt; where its elements and attributes because object properties.\n&gt;\n&gt; PHP v4, still used by leading CMS packages, doesn&#39;t provide broad XML\n&gt; support.\n&gt;\n&gt; Deployed browsers differ on levels of XML support, don&#39;t support loading XML\n&gt; as an object in the same manner that JSON does, and browsers don&#39;t provide\n&gt; full and easy support for all the baggage that XML often brings.
