If the User is anonymous, when they GET the\n&gt; Resource, the Representation returned displays one set of information.\n&gt; However, if the User if of the type Admin, the Representation returned\n&gt; displays the same information, but with additional information\n&gt; relevant to the Admin User.\n\n&gt; My question is this: should the decision to display this different\n&gt; response data rest with the Resource, or the Representation: that is,\n&gt; should the Resource always return ALL the information, regardless of\n&gt; the User type, and let the Representation determine this information\n&gt; to be returned based on User type, or should the data the Resource\n&gt; returns be limited based on User type? The latter would, in effect\n&gt; create two Resources, whereas the first would call the same Resource,\n&gt; and filter the response based on rules defined in the Representation.\n\nI would be inclined to say that these different return values are coming\nabout because what you really have are two different resources. Perhaps\na more specific statement of your use case would help clarify things.\n\nI think when you talk about filtering or operations on the\nrepresentation you are referring to what happens within the program that\nis maintaining the resource. If so, this is an internal matter. Only\nwhat the user sees is important in the REST architecture. The design of\nyour program is a separate matter: Should you have two objects for the\ntwo resources, or should you have one object and another that provides\nfiltering on the representation that object produces? Answer: It\ndepends :)\n\nREST permits intermediataries to be introduced into an architecture, and\nthis layering doesn&#39;t stop at the edge of your process. The protocol\nhandling code is an intermediatary. You might have a pipeline that\ncontains authentication modules and other transformations.\n\nIn this case it would seem that security is an issue. If so, you would\nwant to look at whether tagging information as admin-only and filtering\nit out is safer than constructing separate layering chains for the\nadmin-only and generic content. It&#39;s hard to say without looking at your\ncode, although it might be easier to secure the admin resources if they\nhad separate urls to the non-admin resources. A rights-checking layer\ncould match all of the .*/admin pages and disallow access to\nunauthorised users.\n\nAnother way to approach the problem is to say that the normal page is\none resource, but the additional information is another resource\nreserved for administrators. For example, you might have a div down the\nbottom of the page where admin information is to be dynamically inserted\ndependent on rights being granted. You could use a javascript capability\nlike HInclude to conditionally incorporate the admin information into\nthe main content. This would have caching as well as other benefits. The\npure anonymous page could be served by a completely different\napplication as the admin-only page if you so desired.\n\nBenjamin.\n\n\n"}}
