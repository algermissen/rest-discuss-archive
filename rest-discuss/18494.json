For example:\n\n   1. In REST we can add new rel - in SOAP we can add new method. Both\n   types of old clients will continue working with new services.\n   2. In REST we can add new form field and set its default value - in SOAP\n   we could have service arguments as some ServiceArgs class and add a new\n   field to ServiceArgs. That&#39;s ugly, but it works.\n\n\nWhat are the evolvability examples when SOAP clients break and you can do\nnothing about it, while REST clients are handling the situation gracefully?\n\n-- \nCheers,\nVitaly\n\r\n--f46d041825e038e8f204b74a1787\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;Hello folks, this is my first post in rest-discuss, so please bear wit=\r\nh me.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I get the benefits of changing link uris, bu=\r\nt that&#39;s really not what this post is about.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n=\r\nWhat I mean by evolvability is adding new features to a service or modifyin=\r\ng (when possible) existing ones and that&#39;s actually it.=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;SOAP isn&#39;t that bad as REST community tends to talk about =\r\nit when it comes to evolvability.=A0For example:&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In REST=\r\n we can add new rel - in SOAP we can add new method.
