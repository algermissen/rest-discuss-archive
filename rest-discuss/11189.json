One could argue that the\n&gt; prohibition is a mistake (using, for example, empirical data about the\n&gt; minting of identifiers that contain the square brackets, the willingness\n&gt; of components to consume them, and the willingness of connectors to pass\n&gt; them). Still, the prohibition is there, and the Internet Engineering\n&gt; Steering Group saw fit to canonize RFC 3986 as a full standard.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Maybe you want [the] publisher on the URI as well:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; /books/scifi&lt;penguin&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Again, you&#39;ve chosen delimiters that RFC 3986 prohibits. And here, in\n&gt; the case of the less-than sign and the greater-than sign, I believe that\n&gt; a non-negligible subset of deployed components and connectors will\n&gt; reject the misconstructions.\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Please do not include my address in public replies.
