The ONLY difference between this and\n&gt; &gt;  /artist/LisaSimpson is that the latter is easier for a human\n&gt; to remember.\n&gt; Not true - the other difference is that /artist/LisaSimpson could be\n&gt; constructed from external information (like a telephone book or\n&gt; content from\n&gt; some other resource) and a suitable description of the resources supported\n&gt; by that service. It has to do with using internal identifiers .vs.\n&gt; reasonably shareable identifiers (a zip code, proper name, etc).\n\nWhat I was tring to say, in my clumsy way, is that the approach I was\ndescribing\nuses completely opaque paths that are always generated by the origin server.\nThere is no requirement for an User Agent to calculate the paths and\nconsequently\nthe origin server can use any naming convention it wants to.\n\nThe basis of my suggestion is that only internally generated identifiers are\nused.\nObviously there are trade-offs with this approach. I am certainly not saying\nthat\nit is the only way to go.\n\nAs far as using external sources for generating references to resources, as\nyou\ndescribe above, the way I would do that is to query the system to determine\nwhether such an artist exists. So for example, the phone book lists a\n&quot;Lisa B Simpson&quot; which could be used like this.\n\n   GET /artist?name=Lisa%20B%20Simpson\n\nThe http path, /artist, suggests that only one artist should be returned,\nhowever\nthe URI includes a query so some proxes will not cache the result.\nConsequently,\nthe Origin Server may redirect to /artist/LisaSimpson which will be cached.\nIn this way aliases can be easily converted to the connonical URI for the\nartist\n(at least its connonical as far as the origin server is concerned).\n\nOnce again, you don&#39;t have to do it this way, but IMHO it simplifies the\nlogic\non the User Agent.\n\nRegards\nDonald.\n\n\n\n"}}
