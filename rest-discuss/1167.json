If the\n&gt; XML is going to be processed by a machine anyways, why is the latter\n&gt; approach any better?  \n\nThe &quot;only machines will see it&quot; argument is the typical of the approach\nof people who don&#39;t care about syntax. ;)\n\n&gt; ... I suppose if it were hand authored, but is that\n&gt; what we&#39;re talking about here?\n\nWell yes, some of it is completely hand-authored. But at some level it\nis ALL hand-authored. After all, somebody has to write and debug the\nprograms that works with this stuff. Admittedly, RDF (no matter how\nugly) is not quite as bad as binary but nevertheless I see this: &quot;don&#39;t\nworry what it looks like&quot; argument as a slippery slope to unreadability\nand ultimately back to binary.\n\n&gt; Also, I think the XML syntax for the RDF model is a horrible, nasty,\n&gt; unnecessary thing.  It should be killed.\n\nYou mean that RDF should not be XML-expressible at all? Use\ns-expressions? Or do you mean you dislike all of the weird\nminimizations?\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; I&#39;ve heard talk of adorning schemas with the information necessary to\n&gt; construct RDF.  I like this in theory, though I fear for the practical\n&gt; implications; primarily, additional network round-trips.\n\nThe relationship between documents and schemas will typically be many to\none so you can do a lot of caching of schemas. Sophisticated RDF use is\nalready dependent on schemas (RDF schemas) to get subclassing and\ninferencing information, isn&#39;t it? So if you want high volume use of RDF\nI think you&#39;ll have to figure out schema caching technologies. Is it\nreally feasible to use RDF without one of: a) a schema or b) a priori\nknowledge of the vocabulary?\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s certainly valuable but in my personal opinion, most XML users\n&gt; &gt; will not be willing to pay the price of designing their vocabularies\n&gt; &gt; specifically for RDF compatibility.\n&gt; \n&gt; For now, that&#39;s clearly true.  As more RDF features are integrated into\n&gt; tools, the cost of doing this will come down.\n\nI don&#39;t see it as a tools cost but as a readability cost. Sprinkling all\nof that RDF junk through my document is, imo, as unacceptable as\nsprinkling SOAP voodoo into my messages. I guess it boils down to: I\nthink you optimize the XML for readability and processability *as XML*\nand then figure out how to get the benefits of protocols and metadata\nengines etc. You think that RDF is primary and that XML is just a\ncontainer for it.\n\nBut if that&#39;s true then RDF should use an optimized-for-RDF syntax, not\nXML at all.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
