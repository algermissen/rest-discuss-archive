Th=\r\ne media type will always be &quot;application/vnd.ms-excel&quot; no matter what, so w=\r\ne cannot change/switch on that.\n\n4) Exactly the same argument goes for repr=\r\nesenting the sales order in HTML, HAL, and, well, even as a PDF or an image=\r\n!\n\nI guess it boils down to a question of what kind of variations we need. =\r\nLet me give some examples:\n\nA) Different languages (english, turkish, what-=\r\never). For this we can use the HTTP header Accept-Language.\n\nB) Different c=\r\nontent (with or without summaries, full address, detailed information etc.)=\r\n. In this case I would say we declare them as different resources and need =\r\ndifferent URIs, for instance with a &quot;?format=3Dxxx&quot; parameter.\n\nC) Differen=\r\nt layout but with the same content. For instance a new version of the sprea=\r\ndsheet with the same data but in different cells. Typically we would mint a=\r\n new version of the media type - but that certainly doesn&#39;t make sense for =\r\na spreadsheet!\n\n/J=F8rn\n\n\n\n"}}
