By\ndoing\n&gt; a GET on the top-level subscription resource? Then it would have to do a\n&gt; GET/DELETE on each event. Sounds like a lot of round trips.\n&gt;\nRound trips are needed for reliability - confirming that the message\nactually made it down to the client and was successfully processed.\nYou could PUT a status of &#39;accepted&#39; on inital delivery and after some time\npasses do a final ack via DELETE. (or use PUT for both and have the\ncollection defined to be messaging only in a certain state, or not, and have\nthe client filter... lots of choices)\n\n"}}
