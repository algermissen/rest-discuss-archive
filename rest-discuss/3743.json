You could offer test cases in which two consecutive GETs\non the same URI yield unacceptably different representations,\nindicating that no *identity* was backing them.  You can find many\ntest cases where there seems to be a backing *identity*.  And\nnotice that there are different perspectives for forming judgments\nabout when there is backing identity and when there is not.\n\nIs the system unRESTful, or am I a wacky authority with a bent\nview of identity that doesn&#39;t fit with the rest of the world?  You\ncan certainly stretch the concept of identity too far for general\nconsumption.\n\nI don&#39;t think the court use case is a red herring.  It represents a\npossible worst case scenario for resolving what constitutes an acceptable\nnotion of identity in a formalized business environment using the web.\nIn other words, a dot com.\n\nWalden\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;S.

When I log in (via a web form), I\n&gt; arrive at the homepage for my account:\n&gt;\n&gt;   https://www.accountonline.com/AccountSummary\n&gt;\n&gt; This page has my current balance, available\n&gt; credit, last payment made, and last payment date,\n&gt; among other information.

This is a key part of the &quot;self-describing&quot;\n&gt; &gt; umbrella.  As an example, if you were a party to the court action, then\n&gt; &gt; your identity (via your name) on some document is likely relevant.  But\n&gt; &gt; the colour of your hair probably wouldn&#39;t be (as an example of what\n&gt; &gt; might be returned from GET on my URI).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In Paul&#39;s example there, if the state of the resource was important,\n&gt; &gt; even if it was believed static, it should have been included in the\n&gt; &gt; court documents by value rather than by reference.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; MB\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Thu, Jul 03, 2003 at 06:17:46PM -0700, Paul Prescod wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Walden Mathews wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Paul,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I buy all that, and yet I still have an issue with Tyler&#39;s example\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the bank account URI that identifies anyone&#39;s account at that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bank, depending on who&#39;s fired up their user agent.  To me, the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; account (identified by the bank sure enough with its own number)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has identity that transcends the clever &quot;my account&quot; resource,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and the legal system is going to be more interested in the former\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than the latter, if issues arise.  Identity is tricky business.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; ...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; If the person sitting to my left pilfers from my bank account, I\nwant\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; the identity of both to be irrefutable, so I guess I won&#39;t be\ndragging\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; any URI into court.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, it seems clear to me that one needs to drag _digitally signed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; messages_ into courts. Let&#39;s say you have a very precise (specific)\nand\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   URI for a single transaction with a single invariant representation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Then you go to court and you notice that the transaction has changed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The interface said it was invariant but the scoundrels have changed it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in the database.
