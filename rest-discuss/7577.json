That&#39;s \n&gt; not being pedantic either.\n\nI understand what you are saying, but I believe your point about separation\nof concerns does not hold for the use case we are discussing.  If we were\nonly discussing the path to get there it would be one thing, but we are\ninstead discussing the state of the resource which includes breadcrumbs.\nJust like the probability of get heads on a coin flip does not change no\nmatter how many times you flip the coin, when someone is at the resource\nwith the specific breadcrumbs the may want to move up and then back down the\nheirarchy and that has nothing to with with where they&#39;ve been.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n&quot;It never ceases to amaze how many people will proactively debate away\nattempts to make the web more usable...&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
