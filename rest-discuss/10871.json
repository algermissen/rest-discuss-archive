That is what I meant when I said &quot;and usually =\r\nnavigate to that\nstate in one step&quot;. When you are looking at things from a =\r\nstate\nmachine perspective, POST is often like a request that says &quot;Please\na=\r\ndd the state described in the body and transition me to that new\nstate&quot;. Th=\r\nough its not necessarily always like that I suppose. It\ncould perhaps be ge=\r\nneralized to something like this: &quot;Please change\nthe state machine as descr=\r\nibed in the body and transition me to the\nstate that represents my changes&quot;=\r\n? \n\n&gt; \n&gt; The client doesn&#39;t *change* the state machine, per se =E2=80=A6 it=\r\n merely\ntransitions\n&gt; between the states allowed by the server, as describe=\r\nd by the\nhypermedia.\n&gt; Those transitions might end up mutating the state ma=\r\nchine, but\nthat&#39;s not the\n&gt; same as the client mutating the state machine.\n=\r\n&gt; \n\nSo I agree that the server is changing the state machine in response\nto=\r\n the requests from the client. The client can&#39;t directly change the\nstate m=\r\nachine (i.e. the resources) -- it has to ask the server to do\nit on its beh=\r\nalf. The requests made by the clients effect the changes\nto the resources/s=\r\ntate machine performed by the server (though of\ncourse resources could chan=\r\nge for other reasons -- e.g. a resource\nthat represents the weather in New =\r\nYork).\n\nWas I missing something other than the server being involved though=\r\n?\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=B9: I think &quot;HATEOAS&quot; is a bad name.  &quot;Hypermedia constraint&quot; =\r\nis more\n&gt; descriptive, and less &quot;HATE&quot;-filled. :)\n&gt; \n\nYa, HATEOAS is a mout=\r\nh-full... but I think the &quot;engine&quot; and\n&quot;application state&quot; parts are import=\r\nant as well. I think they\nrepresent specific areas where attempts at REST t=\r\nend to fall short.\n\n\n"}}
