But I don&#39;t think \nFielding&#39;s thesis mentions any particular methods at all. WebDAV&#39;s \n&quot;extra&quot; methods are not against REST merely because they are extra \nmethods. Perhaps if they violate some of the other constraints of \nREST...(e.g. if they were specific, or stateful, ...) I&#39;m not convinced \nthat WebDAV properties are necessarily &quot;against&quot; REST but it may be that \ncould have been done in a manner that fit Web infrastructure better. \nSomeone definately needs to write a paper on that one day.\n\nYou probably know this Mark but I just wanted to make the point.\n\n&gt; P.S. iCal supports Digest Auth; yippee!\n\nAlright!\n\nDid you reverse engineer the iCal protocol and file formats enough to \ndetermine to what extent it is RESTful? Does it use URIs in a sane way etc?\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
