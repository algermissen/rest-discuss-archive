That is, perform some other requests\n&gt; using partiluar domain semantics of an accessed service?\n&gt;\n\nSure.  You&#39;re just applying the layered-system constraint on the client\nside.  Thus, your client state becomes separated from application state.\nApplication state is entirely derived from the retrieved representation,\nwhile actual client state is opaque to the server component which sent\nthe representation, because it &quot;cannot &#39;see&#39; beyond the immediate layer\nwith which [it interacts],&quot; to paraphrase REST.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; For example, think of a client configuration that would cause the\n&gt; client to allways execute several searches when the home page of an\n&gt; online store is reached that provides OpenSearch forms?\n&gt; \n\nI think that&#39;s out of scope to REST, which is only concerned with the\ninteractions between connectors in a system.  What the user&#39;s agent\nactually does with the retrieved representations is opaque behind the\nuniform interface.  The media type tells the client all it really needs\nto know about rendering the document to obtain application state,\ndoesn&#39;t it?\n\nFor example, a user may employ an accessibility agent which performs\nspecific actions based on content.  Or a Web accelerator which follows\nand pre-caches DNS responses and retrieved representations that a user\nhasn&#39;t yet requested, or what you suggested.  I just don&#39;t think REST\ncares about any of that. I would call these examples &quot;enhanced client\nstate&quot;, but I don&#39;t see how any of that affects &quot;application state&quot; as\nenvisioned by the server through its media-type declaration.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
