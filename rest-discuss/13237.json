Is this idea explained somewhere in\n&gt; some detail?  I think of serialization as the &quot;conversion of data to\n&gt; bits for transmission&quot; and I&#39;m unfortunately not making the\n&gt; connection.\n\nObject -&gt; xml is what I meant by serialization.\n\n&gt; I&#39;m using XML, an extensible format, but changes still require a new\n&gt; schema - a new version - I&#39;m struggling to see how &#39;extensibility&#39;\n&gt; obviates my essential problem which is, &#39;client is programmed based on\n&gt; knowledge of a particular representation(schema), if the schema\n&gt; changes in an incompatible way, how does the client negotiate for the\n&gt; representation it understands&#39;?\n\nxsd:Any + xsd:AnyAttribute + xmlns.\n\n\nThe attachment to a strict schema is exactly what introduces the need to\nversion. Ad-hoc independent additions to container formats targeted to your\nneeds means supporting multiple versions is easy.\n\n&gt; and 3) existing explanations on the Internet take a\n&gt; &#39;use-existing-media-type&#39; approach that is naive and somewhat\n&gt; unhelpful in the complexities that arise when implementing an\n&gt; architecture in a large enterprise.\n\n\n&gt; Can you point me to some resource that describes what you are\n&gt; referring to in more concrete detail?  I find statements like this to\n&gt; be too nebulous to truly appreciate.\n\nObject -&gt; xml together with strict xsd is the root of most of the issues\npeople seem to have with media type design. This is my core point.\n\nThe message format itself, aka your xsd, is to me completely irrelevant.\nWhat is relevant is if the media type processor, through whatever means it\nhas to find data in a format, can gather enough information to process a\nrequest. If it does, the process will go through, if not it won&#39;t.\n\nAnd when you get to that point, chances are fairly high that xsd is in fact\nmore trouble than its worth.\n\nSeb\n\n\n"}}
