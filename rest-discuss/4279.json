Whether you call it\n/mergeService or /merge it&#39;s effectively the same\nthing.  \n\nThe fundamental issue is that:\n\n&quot;[REST] ... concentrates the application state within \nthe user agent components.&quot;\n\nThe reason the verb-vs-noun issue surfaces is because \nin many cases it isn&#39;t practical to concentrated state \nat the user agent.  In the case of &quot;merge&quot; it would be easy\nto:\n\n\t1. Add the funds of account 2 into account 1\n\t2. Delete the funds of account 2\n\t3. Update account 1\n\t4. Update account 2\n\nThe client does all the work and the server is statelessly\nmaking the appropriate changes.  \n\nThe problems are of course:\n\t\n\t1. There is no transaction around the four \n\t   discrete actions.\n\t2. There is no record of how the accounts came\n\t   to be in the state that they are in.\n\nThe practical solution is to &quot;elevate&quot; the transaction\nitself to a full resource.\n\nAs you say, dereferencing this resource could serve \nas a record of what happened.  \n\n(You could also imagine that it could serve other \npurposes: Creating the &quot;merge&quot; transaction might \nnot necessarily immediately trigger the change; it\nmight need to be triggered at a later time, etc.)\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Jon Hanna [mailto:jon@...] \nSent: Wednesday, March 24, 2004 6:50 AM\nTo: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [rest-discuss] When is a Verb also a Noun (was Re: Do not put\nactions in URIs)\n\n\nThe action URI thread has reminded me of something that has occurred \nto me on a few occasions.\n\nNow I agree that the following are bad:\n\n&lt;http://example.net/merge&gt;\n&lt;http://example.net/dostuff?action=merge&gt;\n\nHowever what about a POST to http://example.net/mergeService/ \ncontaining something like:\n\n&lt;resourceMerge xmlns=&quot;http://example.org/mergeNS&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;dest xlink:href=&quot;/resource1&quot;/&gt;\n      &lt;src xlink:href=&quot;/resource1&quot;/&gt;\n      &lt;src xlink:href=&quot;/resource2&quot;/&gt;\n      &lt;mergeType \nxlink:href=&quot;http://example.org/mergeNS/mergeTypes/concat&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/resourceMerge&gt;\n\nNow &lt;http://example.org/mergeNS/mergeTypes/concat&gt; says what to do \n(concatenation, as opposed to say \n&lt;http://example.org/mergeNS/mergeTypes/chronologicalFold&gt; which might \nresult in the merged document having items from the two sources in \nchronological order). So really the &lt;...concat&gt; URI is a verb.\n\nIf dereferenced it would (if it returned anything) presumably return \nsomething which documented this action. When dereferencing we are \nusing it as a noun - it&#39;s a &quot;thing&quot; and we are finding out something \nabout it, but when used in the mergeType element it is a verb, or at \nleast an adverb.\n\nNone of this is new of course, but I&#39;ve been wondering how it fits as \nfar as verb-URIs-are-a-Bad-Thing and I&#39;m struck by a conflict between \nthe two.\n\nIt seems to me in this case though that there is a slight analogy to \nC/C++ function pointers, C++ function objects, Javascript function \nreferences, etc.. I don&#39;t want to make too much of that analogy \n(comparing web services to programming languages, leads to - well it \ndoesn&#39;t lead to REST) but I&#39;m finding some peace with this type of \nverb URIs.\n\nAgreements?, Disagreements?\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
