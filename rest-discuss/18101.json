I have not seen anything in practice\nwhich supports that premi=\r\nse.\n\n&gt;&gt; I was asking specifically about httpbis&#39; overspecified:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &#39;PUT =\r\nis an idempotent update of state that is a complete replacement&#39;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; vs t=\r\nhe more generally applicable and succinct:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &#39;PUT is an idempotent upda=\r\nte of state&#39;\n&gt;\n&gt; And you have been answered, many times. =A0PUT means PUT. =\r\n=A0There are no\n&gt; partial updates in PUT.\n\nSorry, that&#39;s much of an answer.=\r\n\n\n&gt; There was a half-assed attempt to add those\n&gt; semantics by committee in=\r\n the midst of standardizing HTTP, but that\n&gt; attempt failed because PUT&#39;s e=\r\nxisting semantics had already been deployed\n&gt; and we can&#39;t graft partial up=\r\ndates on top of existing replace semantics.\n&gt; Period. =A0End of story.\n\nAga=\r\nin; you must be aware that 2616 is not clear enough on this front,\notherwis=\r\ne why did you work on clarifying it?\n\nFurthermore, there is no evidence - a=\r\ns in zero - of intermediary\nmechanisms/plumbing that relies on PUT having r=\r\neplace semantics. I\nhave asked for an example several times in this thread.=\r\n So there is\nabsolutely no evidence that changing this semantic would *actu=\r\nally*\nhave a detrimental effect on any web infrastructure. Specific\napplica=\r\ntions and their use of PUT would not be negatively effected by\ngeneralising=\r\n PUTs definition; the only requirement would be that those\napplications tak=\r\ne on the responsbility of specifying their additional\nreplace-only semantic=\r\ns for PUT in their context. Most applications do\nthis anyway, for example:\n=\r\n\nhttp://wiki.basho.com/Keys-and-Objects.html\n\n&quot;When performing any fetch or=\r\n update operation in Riak, the entire\nRiak Object must be retrieved or modi=\r\nfied; there are no partial\nfetches or updates.&quot;\n\n&gt; Hence, PATCH was defined=\r\n in 1995 (and finally\n&gt; standardized much later because the WebDAV group wa=\r\ns lazy).\n&gt;\n&gt; This answer is final. =A0If anyone implements it differently i=\r\nn Rails,\n&gt; then Rails will be neither compliant with HTTP nor compliant wit=\r\nh REST.\n&gt; Whether that matters to anyone developing Rails is besides the po=\r\nint.\n\nWell as it stands I don&#39;t think 2616 is anywhere clear enough for tha=\r\nt\nbe an objective truth. Granted, this will become a truth if HTTPbis\npushe=\r\ns out its current over-specified interpretation of PUT - I would\ncontend th=\r\nat this is an unnecessary change for the worse, but given\nyour advantageous=\r\n position; if you want to insist &quot;that&#39;s just the way\nit&#39;s going to be&quot;, th=\r\nere&#39;s not a lot I can do about it, is there? :)\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n"}}
