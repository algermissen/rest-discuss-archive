The method only signifies\n&gt;&gt;the action desired by the user agent.  How that is accomplished is left\n&gt;&gt;to the server implementation.  Some implementations will have garbage\n&gt;&gt;collection, others will delete on last reference removed, and still\n&gt;&gt;others will refuse a delete until the namespace is empty.  In any case,\n&gt;&gt;the client cannot delete the URI -- it can only see and manipulate the\n&gt;&gt;representation, and all it expects from the origin server is that the\n&gt;&gt;old representation is no longer available once the DELETE succeeds.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;When you say &quot;all it expects from the origin server is that the old\n&gt;representation is no longer available&quot;, do you mean that no representation\n&gt;is available for the given URI or that a representation can still be\n&gt;available after-the-fact, but the client can make the absolute claim that\n&gt;the two representations (before and after the DELETE) are not the same?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nOr simply that the representation(state) that existed at the time the \nDELETE operation was applied no longer exists?\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n\n"}}
