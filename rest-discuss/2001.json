I&#39;ve tried to find postings or articles on\nstandard practices but haven&#39;t found anything.\n\nHere&#39;s the problem: Let&#39;s say you have a mechanism that allows you to invoke\nSOAP requests via HTTP. Let&#39;s say the SOAP request takes parameters str,\nnum, and bool. So to invoke it from HTTP (I&#39;ll use GET as an example, but it\nwould be similar for POST, you would issue:\n\n  http://host.com/soapfunction?str=hello&num=12&bool=true\n\nBut SOAP lets you build complex nested structures with named fields (think\nof a C struct or a Java class with only public data members). If you want to\ninvoke one of these guys via HTTP, one way would be to use a &#39;dot&#39; notation\nlike C or Java:\n\n  http://host.com/soapfunction?struct.str=hello&struct.num=55\n\nThe place where it hits a bit of a snag is when you have the notion of\narrays to tackle:\n\n  http://host.com/soapfunction?str[1]=hello&str[2]=world\n\nThe first problem is how the bracket &#39;[]&#39; characters are handled. Some\nbrowsers just urlencode the whole thing  and ship it down to the server to\nlet it deal with it. Some older browsers barf on it. Some server-side\ntoolkits are cool with it. Others aren&#39;t. It&#39;s pretty inconsistent out\nthere. I also came across one case where the stuff before the &#39;=&#39; could\n*only* be alpha/numeric/dash/underline if it was a form-POST (I&#39;ll try to\nremember where I saw it).\n\nI&#39;ve thought of trying &#39;{}&#39; (braces), &#39;()&#39; (parens), or &#39;&lt;&gt;&#39; (lt/gt)\ncharacters but I&#39;m guessing it&#39;ll have similar problems with brackets. Ugly,\nbut workable is to use something like &quot;str_1&quot; as a stand-in for &quot;str[1]&quot; but\nit kinda gives me the willies.\n\nAnyway, if anyone has already done some work on this, or if there&#39;s a\nstandard spec I&#39;ve missed, please point me at it. I&#39;d rather not reinvent\nthe wheel. Barring that, are there any opinions on what&#39;s the friendliest\nway to encode structs and arrays in URL parameters?\n\nThe easy way out would be to say &quot;if you need to use structs and arrays go\nSOAP -- for simple params, use HTTP&quot; but I think it&#39;s good to keep REST-like\ninterfaces applicable for more complex interfaces.\n\nThanks,\nRamin\n---\nRamin Firoozye\nWizen Software\n---\n\n\n"}}
