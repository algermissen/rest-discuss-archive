Nice work.  Quick comment on\n&gt; colors.  Consider using another color combination than red and green to make\n&gt; it easier to intuitively parse intent even for colorblind readers.\n\nAny color combo suggestions?\n\n&gt; Comments prefixed by slide number:\n&gt; [8] REST & HTTP\n&gt; Ok, I can&#39;t resist.  This slide would be a great place to explain that REST\n&gt; + WWW is an application of REST, referred to as WOA by some. ;)\n\nAdded:\n\n&quot;REST + HTTP is sometimes referred to as WOA\n- Web Oriented Architecture&quot;\n\n&gt; [16] Hypermedia:\n&gt; It&#39;s important to note that there is considerable cost associated with\n&gt; introducing new media-types that would qualify as HATEOS candidates.  The\n&gt; media-type must define how to discover relationships between resources; and\n&gt; how the client can build requests to interact with the server.  HTML and\n&gt; AtomPub do this already.  Urge the audience to use these instead of rolling\n&gt; their own.\n\nAdded &quot;But beware: media-types are expensive to create&quot; to the slide\nunder &quot;There are more media-types than just HTML and Atom&quot;\n\n&gt; [19] Style += Code on Demand\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure how I&#39;m supposed to interpret &quot;simplifies clients&quot; in this\n&gt; context.  If the client is a browser then implementing a browser that\n&gt; supports CoD is certainly more complex than one that doesn&#39;t.  Isn&#39;t CoD\n&gt; rather an escape mechanism for the media-type so that the semantics of\n&gt; discovering and building new requests are not bound by the media-type&#39;s\n&gt; expressive capabilities?  Somewhat similar to POST vs. GET/PUT/DELETE.\n\nFrom the dissertation: &quot;This simplifies clients by reducing the number\nof features required to be pre-implemented.&quot;\n\n&gt; [22] Plain Old XML (POX)\n&gt; I would broaden the category of POX.  Even if your server returns something\n&gt; of the form &lt;cart href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;&lt;item href=&quot;...&quot; /&gt;&lt;/cart&gt; with media-type\n&gt; application/cart+xml, that&#39;s still POX.  The telltale sign is that the\n&gt; media-type is so narrowly defined that it cannot be processed without\n&gt; application specific knowledge.  A true HATEOS compliant media-type enables\n&gt; a useful interactive surface without the need for specialization.  However,\n&gt; specialization may be required to enable certain features.  For example,\n&gt; knowledge of GDATA specific link relationships to enable batch operations in\n&gt; AtomPub.\n\nNot at all sure that I understand your meaning. Could you elaborate\nplease? Any links you can send me?\n\n&gt; [24] Soap Services (WS-*)\n&gt; SOA pundits will claim that SOA is not SOAP/WS-* but something much more\n&gt; general (just to be clear, I&#39;m not one of them, so don&#39;t flame me! :) ).  To\n&gt; avoid being distracted by these pundits, simply avoid drawing this\n&gt; relationship.  Only refer to SOAP/WS-* and you&#39;ll be fine.\n\nI&#39;m open to dropping the SOA reference, but would like to hear the\nopinions of others in the group if anyone wants to offer ...\n\n&gt; [25] Standardization\n&gt; I can&#39;t agree with this.  REST states constraints, but does not define\n&gt; further specifics.  For WOA, I totally agree, because now it includes HTTP,\n&gt; HTML, AtomPub, RDF, URIs, etc.\n\nInteresting. This slide is basically one of Roy&#39;s slide from ApacheCon\n2007 reformatted.\n\nI have changed &quot;Facts&quot; to &quot;Facts (when using HTTP)&quot;\n\n&gt; [26] Man -vs- Machine\n&gt; I would also add microformats to the Fact list.  Some nice applications have\n&gt; been successfully built by semantically annotating HTML.\n\nGood point. Hadn&#39;t thought of that. Added &quot;Microformats can reduce ambiguity&quot;.\n\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; - Steve\n&gt; --------------\n&gt; Steve G.
