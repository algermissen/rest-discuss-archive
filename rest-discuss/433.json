However, many of the applications for HTTP Events that I\n&gt; &gt; can think of are _personal_, and in the radical vision I&#39;d expect my\n&gt; &gt; personal computer to have several apps listening to and sending HTTP\n&gt; &gt; events.\n&gt;\n&gt; We&#39;re talking utopian here. &quot;Personal HTTP Events&quot; is not high on my\n&gt; priority list. I&#39;m thinking more about web services stuff. But here&#39;s my\n&gt; Utopian view of personal HTTP events.\n\nNifty.\nThis is what I called &#39;Appster&#39; - local apps listening to messages on a\nclient (and dealing with firewalled nodes). But rather than a classical\nserver that handles the events by returning data, these events drive UI. The\ncode, framework, APIs etc. can still come from the HTTP server world -\nessentially take Apache and some useful mods to deal with security,\ndispatching, etc and add inter-process messages to get to those &#39;registered\napps&#39;. I had hacked up Apache a bit to start this and was working on the COM\ninterface for registering and receiving events - not too difficult.\n\nIf anybody is interested in starting this up with Apache as the base let me\nknow - I&#39;ve got a domain we can use to host it... groovier.net\n\nMike\n\n"}}
