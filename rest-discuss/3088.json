Preferably a business scenario, since that is all \n&gt; I would claim, and preferably identifying the participants even if \n&gt; hypothetically by class?\n\nAn example of both fan-out and fan-in would be me invoking GET on a URI\nidentifying &quot;my current net worth&quot;, which may not be stored in one\nplace.  So the GET gets fanned out to every party that I have any assets\nwith, and then responses then fan-in back.  The parties there would be\nme, the parties holding my assets, plus an intermediary party who can\naggregate that information (optionally - it could just be software under\nmy control, or software that one of the other parties uses).\n\nThat&#39;s a bit of a weak fan-in example, since it&#39;s plain-vanilla\nresponses to a GET request (at least after the intermediary).  But you\ncould imagine responses being disconnected (via explicit correlation\nrather than implicit correlation via the connection) from requests.\n\n&gt; Collaxa&#39;s Take: +1. This design pattern also known as a star \n&gt; interaction pattern is very important for building &quot;self healing&quot; and \n&gt; adaptable distributed applications: managing exception is easier in a \n&gt; pair conversations. The same is true for version control.\n&gt; Posted 11:32 AM by Edwin Khodabakchian\n\nThat makes some sense.  I haven&#39;t given it much thought.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.
