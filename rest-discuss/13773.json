I&#39;m not sure much, if anything at all, is lost \nby this - since both bnodes and literals (to the best of my \nunderstanding) belong on the very edges of a graph anyway as they are  \neffectively &#39;stubs&#39;.\n\nI imagine one potential solution to this is to treat all literals and \nbnodes as resources and give them a URI; a benefit of this is that \nliterals would not necessarily &#39;stub&#39; the graph - because the server \nresponsible for a given literal could monitor Refferer headers and \ndynamically monitor, build up, and &#39;feed back&#39; its context by updating \nits link relations. &#39;Duplicate&#39; literals at separate URIs could also \nhave link relations to one another, allowing for a more distributed \napproach that could avoid having to rely on an external SPOF.\n\nI don&#39;t profess to have a full understanding of RDF, and I would be \ninterested to hear others&#39; thoughts on this.\n\n- Mike\n\n"}}
