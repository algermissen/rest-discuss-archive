Eventually, because it\ndepends on the context, culture, et=\r\nc.\n\nThere is an analogy with 1) uniform POST semantics at the network\nlevel=\r\n and 2) application meaning from the pov of application.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; after careful=\r\n review, i claim you will find that there *are*\n&gt;&gt;&gt; real-world markers, ind=\r\nicators, semantic &quot;switches&quot; that exist in the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; real world; ones that ar=\r\ne recognized, parsed, and (when appropriate)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; activated by humans. Curre=\r\nntly, thesemarkers are the visual cues that\n&gt;&gt;&gt; are rendered by common Web =\r\nbrowsers via the messages sent by servers\n&gt;&gt;&gt; in the most ubiquitous human-=\r\ncentered hypermedia format of the day;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; HTML.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Semantic meaning&quot;=\r\n is an emergent property. In the case of HTML that\n&gt;&gt;&gt; property is &quot;created=\r\n&quot; by humans when they observe the visual\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;landscape&quot; rendered by =C2=A0=\r\nWeb browsers.\n\nNot necessarily an emergent property only. The meaning can b=\r\ne formally\ndefined by humans (by logic, common vocabularies, knowledge\nrepr=\r\nesentation, etc) and encoded in the software. The encoded semantic\nessentia=\r\nlly constitutes  the shared understanding between the client\nand the server=\r\n.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Does anyone here want to assert that this &quot;semantic meaning&quot; can=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; _only_ emerge when humans are *directly* involved in the real-time\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n interpretation of messages that contain these (or similar) markers?\n&gt;&gt;\n\nAn=\r\nybody can create a client, which will read the same HTML tags on a\nweb page=\r\n, but it will hardly be expected these days to have full human\nreasoning ca=\r\npabilities.\n\n&gt;&gt; Afaict, there&#39;s a spectrum of sophistication here. I haven&#39;=\r\nt seen a\n&gt;&gt; client implementation which demonstrates automated capabilities=\r\n which\n&gt;&gt; come &#39;close&#39; to that of a human, we&#39;re basically talking about th=\r\ne\n&gt;&gt; web&#39;s version of a Turing Test.\n&gt;&gt;\n\nIndeed.\n\n&gt;&gt; Most of the evidence s=\r\no far suggests this is the case, although I am\n&gt;&gt; not an AI expert.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nOr\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is it possible that humans can &quot;code&quot; agents to have (at least some\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of) this same ability to recognize, parse, and activate the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;afford=\r\nances&quot; found in the hypermedia landscape?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; It is my assertion that t=\r\nhe latter is the case. I also contend that\n&gt;&gt;&gt; making the assumption that t=\r\nhis is possible is a key step in advancing\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the art and theory of distri=\r\nbuted hypermedia.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\nWell, if regarding hypermedia as one of the instance=\r\ns of knowledge\nrepresentation, this is certainly within the research scope =\r\nof AI /\nmachine learning.\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I think it&#39;s an interesting research topic=\r\n but the complexity of\n&gt;&gt; producing these sorts of clients is so high, it&#39;s=\r\n inevitable that only\n&gt;&gt; a small portion of your client base will behave th=\r\nis way (unless you\n&gt;&gt; control them all, in which case your system is not ve=\r\nry distributed!).\n&gt;&gt; So, in practice, you will be forced to only evolve you=\r\nr application in\n&gt;&gt; a way that caters to the lowest common denominator - un=\r\ndermining the\n&gt;&gt; effort that has gone into more sophisticated clients. This=\r\n is a big\n&gt;&gt; challenge to overcome in and of itself, irrespective of the ch=\r\nallenge\n&gt;&gt; of inventing the designs for such an autonomous hypermedia agent=\r\n.\n&gt;&gt;\n\nAgree.\n\nRegards,\nNina\n\n&gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;&gt; Mike\n\n"}}
