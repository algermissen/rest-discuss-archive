We also have lessons describing a\n&gt; combina=\r\ntion of a room, a course and a time interval.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now I want to make &quot;this&quot;=\r\n week&#39;s lessons available as a ressource -  \n&gt; for\n&gt; instance:\n&gt;\n&gt;  /lesson=\r\ns/thisweek?room=3DP160&course=3D43S09\n&gt;\n&gt; My question is: when both rooms a=\r\nnd courses are ressouces themselves  \n&gt; should\n&gt; we then pass the actual re=\r\nssources to the search?

The client shoul=\r\nd, of course,  \ndiscover the identifiers from server-provided lists and not=\r\n make them  \nup based on out of band URI onstruction knowledge.\n\n&gt; it fails=\r\n if ressources are moved to new URLs,\n\nThe server should not move resources=\r\n to new URIs (Cool URIs don&#39;t  \nchange) or at least maintain a mapping from=\r\n old to new. A mapping it  \nwould lso use for redirects from old to new res=\r\nources.\n\nViewed from another angle: if you can even vaguely expect that you=\r\nr  \nURIs would change they are badly chosen; they should not include a  \n&#39;k=\r\ney&#39; for the mapped business object that is subject to change. If  \nroom no.=\r\n or course no. might be reused in your domain, probably choose  \nan artific=\r\nial key. The URI is opaque to the client anyhow.\n\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t\n&gt; like it myse=\r\nlf, and I haven&#39;t seen anybody do it.\n\nI did that and do it and its fine.\n\n=\r\n&gt; But somehow it seems more\n&gt; cleaner or generic in the sense that *everyth=\r\ning* is a ressource -  \n&gt; also\n&gt; search arguments.\n\nYes.\n\nJan\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Comments=\r\n?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks, J=F8rn\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo=\r\n!
