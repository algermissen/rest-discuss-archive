RDF&#39;s heart is in the right place; ontology. And it is through\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; separate ontology you get your semantics.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Don&#39;t really mind what we call it; as long as it is capable of\n&gt;&gt; presenting a succinct, coherent, human-readable description of the\n&gt;&gt; various ways a hypertext application can be traversed.\n&gt;\n&gt; Why the human-readable part? View sourceness?\n&gt;\n\nNo. It&#39;s key because those semantics are really being broadcast to\nhumans (developers writing the consuming agents&#39; logic). If I produce\nan hypertext application and expose its semantics as an &#39;ontology&#39;,\nthose semantics will be consumed by developers first and foremost in\norder to develop their understanding of the way the application flows.\nThe developers will then crystalize that understanding into code which\nwill fulfil the application on their behalf (aka an &#39;agent&#39; or\n&#39;client&#39; to the application). The important thing there is that the\nexchange of application semantics occurred between the human author\nand the human consumer of the application; this is where the\ncoaxing/herding takes place - it&#39;s a form of social engineering. This\nis why the mechanical semantics of HTML or AtomPub are written in\nhuman language.\n\nA link relation provides a standard level of indirection; developers\ncan refer to them as they construct an understanding of the semantics\nof a set of links which comprise an application, and the automated\nagents they create can use them as tokens for distinguishing the links\nin mechanising the developer&#39;s understanding. I use a generic media\ntype to and expose my application as a set of link relations, I can\nthen evolve my application by making non-breaking changes to the\nsemantics of existing links, or inject brand new or breaking semantics\nby introducing new link relations - link relations are much more\ngranular and easier to control than media types in this regard, which\nis why I design applications that way.\n\nI don&#39;t think it needs to get more complex than that, and I&#39;m not 100%\non whether that lack of complexity fails to satisfy the definition of\nan &quot;ontology&quot;\n\n&gt;&gt; not very fond &#39;ontology&#39; though because the word stinks a bit of\n&gt;&gt; esotericism, and I prefer to think and talk about hypertext\n&gt;&gt; applications in terms of happening rather than being anyway.\n&gt;\n&gt; It has a defined use in information technology, so get used to it. :)\n&gt;\n\nAs an application author my concern would be that presenting my\napplication to client developers as an &#39;ontology&#39; would either confuse\nthem or scare them off completely. But, like I said, I don&#39;t think the\nword we use matters /that/ much.\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I tend to say; create a crap HTTP client, and you&#39;ll get a crap HTTP\n&gt;&gt; &gt; system.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; There is no need to create a crap HTTP client.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The problem I have with this advice is that in a distributed context\n&gt;&gt; (e.g. a big SaaS API) the clients will be not be written by me,\n&gt;&gt; they&#39;ll be written by other people with their own (crappy) opinions\n&gt;&gt; and (crappy) technology stacks.\n&gt;\n&gt; For sure. On the other side, you can create beautiful stuff with SOAP, and\n&gt; have a really good API as RPC. In other words, I&#39;m not sure that &quot;other\n&gt; people&quot; is a measure of correctness. Most people don&#39;t get HTML right.\n&gt; Crikey, most people don&#39;t get English right! :)\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The real art of designing a REST application is in coaxing/herding the\n&gt;&gt; clients you don&#39;t control into adopting behaviours which will afford\n&gt;&gt; you the flexibility to evolve. In many cases this means an application\n&gt;&gt; design that compromises on &#39;perfection&#39; in order to lower the barrier\n&gt;&gt; to all the stupid clients e.g. this is exactly the reason there are no\n&gt;&gt; &#39;forms&#39; in HAL.\n&gt;\n&gt; What&#39;s wrong with forms? I have a system which uses XHTML responses with\n&gt; embedded forms and RDFa, and it&#39;s a self-documenting, self-describing,\n&gt; browsable, searchable system to be used by humans (browsers) and computers\n&gt; (API) both. (I have to admit I haven&#39;t looked into HAL. What was that link\n&gt; again? :) )\n&gt;\n\nthink you may have missed my point a bit here. I wasn&#39;t saying there\nis anything actually &#39;wrong&#39; with forms, just that introducing them to\na machine app is (for the time being) a costly and mostly fruitless\neffort - it increases the complexity of consuming the application (by\nadding a requirement to understand form processing rules) without\ndelivering much by way of improving evolvability - it doesn&#39;t bring\nmuch to the table, and many clients will either get it wrong or hack\naround it anyway. This may well improve in the future but right now it\ndoesn&#39;t seem like a good option from the practical, cost-benefit point\nof view (not the architecturally pure one).\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n"}}
