The concern is that someone might go to a library and \ncheck their bank balance and forget to shutdown the browser, \nallowing another person to come along and continue to use the \ncredentials provided by the first user.  A time-out at least\nlimits their exposure.\n\nAllowing for this sort of time-out with a GET-able interface\nwould require a similar kind of mechanism that the Google \ninterface would have if it used GET.  So, my only point was\nthat if one is willing to grant that this is &quot;safe&quot; then a \ncase could be made that it would be okay for Google.\n\n&gt;&gt; But, what if the resources were marked &quot;no-cache&quot;?\n\n&gt; That&#39;s worse!  It will mean that more GETs will have to happen, because\n&gt; the responses from the old ones aren&#39;t any good any longer. 8-O\n\nRight. It was really a poorly phrased question to understand \nwhat the rules are for proxy cache refreshing.  \n\n- Jeff\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
