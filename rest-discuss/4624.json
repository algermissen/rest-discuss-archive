Think of RESTful\n&gt; applications to consist of objects (resources) that all have the same API (PUT,\n&gt; DELETE, GET, POST, etc).\nOK, I&#39;m happy with that. \n\n\n&gt; &gt; (question: Does the recipient *have* to be a server?\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, what is *a server*? If you mean some component that is capable of\n&gt; processing HTTP requests, then yes. But you can certainly mimick REST\n&gt; as a standalone application:\nOK, no is the answer :-)\n\n\n&gt; &gt; What testbeds do people use for restful systems playing/testing?)\n&gt; \n&gt; I am heavy on Apache+mod_perl+libwww, but a Java Servlet container is\n&gt; just as good.

The software resides\non/with \nthe server software?\n\n\n\n&gt; Client/Server is not an issue (if I understand your use of the term correctly),\ntouche :-)\n&gt; REST is about objects with a uniform API and self descriptive messages between\n&gt; them.\nOK, I stand corrected.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Usually, in the process of understanding REST, you&#39;ll have an aha-moment and the\n&gt; full beauty will be visible at once...until then, it helps to stick your head in\n&gt; the WiKi, \nhttp://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl\n\n&gt; the various REST articles, the mailing list archives,\nhttp://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?RestResources ?\n&gt;  and Roy&#39;s\n&gt; dissertation of course.
