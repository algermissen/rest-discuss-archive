It has existed for as\nlong as the term “REST” has and is the mark of a certain\nincomplete understanding of REST that also includes such things\nas taking the CRUD analogy way too seriously and being ignorant\nof the hypermedia constraint. (I went through that phase too.)\nI think it’s the “REST support” in Rails that’s currently doing\nthe most to spread this mistaken conception of REST.\n\n&gt; When I discuss REST on my blog, in articles, in presentations,\n&gt; etc., is it important for me to also discuss the design of the\n&gt; URL?\n\nIf anything is important in that sense, then it’s the design of\nyour resource representations: where do hyperlinks go? What does\na particular form of link mean? Ie. what does it imply about the\noperations you can expect to be able to perform on the target of\nthe link? These are the things that a client has to know in order\nto operate a REST service.\n\nThe structure of URIs, in contrast, is a server implementation\ndetail that the client neither need nor should care about.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
