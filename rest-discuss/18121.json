First my assumption:\n&gt; People don&#39;t get REST, because one o=\r\nf the main ideas is that you need common \n&gt; standard media types for REST. =\r\nBut people don&#39;t know about media types.\n&gt; I&#39;ve done web sites for 6 years =\r\nbut only now, while doing research for my \n&gt; bachelor thesis, I discovered =\r\nhow many great media types are there and could \n&gt; be reused.\n&gt; \n&gt; And there=\r\n is no advertisement for good media types. Where can I go and browse \n&gt; / s=\r\nearch / filter a list of media types and look whether there is already \n&gt; s=\r\nomething registered for my need?\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thomas Koch, http://www=\r\n.koch.ro\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
