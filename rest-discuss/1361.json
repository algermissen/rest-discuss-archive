If we can knock off the really rough edges (or, to continue the analogy,  start with a new piece of wood if it is not the right colour/size/quality/etc) then the wiki can/may help finish it off.\n\n\n&gt;And maybe if the Wiki pages get really good, some of us can put \n&gt;together an article for one of the Web mags, cleaning up the best of \n&gt;the Wiki content.\n\nSounds like an excellent idea.\n\nRobert\n\n\n"}}
