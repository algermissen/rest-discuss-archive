Having a p=\r\n2p network on the HTTP level would not only solve a lot of existing communi=\r\ncation problems of the Web, but also increase the number application-level =\r\nfunctionalities exposed on the Web. Think of all the functionalities that a=\r\nre &quot;trapped&quot; on the client side, disconnected from the Web, although they o=\r\nriginated from the Web by the means of navigating to a Web application.\n\nI =\r\nshould shut up before someone publishes these ideas in a paper before I do.=\r\n :)\n\n+ If you already haven&#39;t, you should check out Justin Erenkrantz&#39;s dis=\r\nsertation on CREST - http://www.erenkrantz.com/CREST/ which is an &quot;evolutio=\r\nn&quot; of REST founded on *very* similar ideas. Guess who Justin&#39;s advisor was.=\r\n.. :)\n\nIvan\n\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Nathan &lt;nathan@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt;\n&gt; Eric J.
