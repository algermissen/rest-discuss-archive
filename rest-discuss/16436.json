Use REST because you want the guaranteed properties to be induced into your system? Or do you want to throw a couple of HTTP stacks at your system, tolerate that your devs interpret Web architecture as it fits their skills and then clean up the mess you likely end up with next year?\n\nI do not see the point in doing that. Why not use RMI or so in the first place? It&#39;s straight-forward for most problems at hand.\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n"}}
