What I&#39;m saying is that it&#39;s\ntoo difficult to deduce the meaning of &quot;REST client&quot; from context from\none person to the next.  REST development involves adapting the terms\nof Roy&#39;s thesis to your problem area.  It&#39;s much harder for me to know\nwhat people mean when their meaning must be taken from context, than\nwhen their meaning is clear due to their use of precise terms.\n\nHave a nice day,\nEric\n\n"}}
