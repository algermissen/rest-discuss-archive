Whether this is holds for a particular system is going\nto depend greatly on the technology on which it is built.   The\ntechnologies i usually use support generalized implementation of\narbitrarily named link elements (ie, an element with an `href`\nattribute) quite easily.  This make the cost of produce the various\nstyles of links basically identical for me.  One should also consider\nthe cost on the client side.  There will usually be more clients\nwritten for a service than servers.\n\nPeter\nbarelyenough.org\n\n"}}
