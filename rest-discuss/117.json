To any intermediary, the effort in determining\n&gt; what&#39;s going on is going to be greater for the extension header than for\n&gt; the extension method, at least during the initial transaction where the\n&gt; intermediary learns what the Watcher URI is.\n\nNo doubt.\n\n&gt; In an environment with\n&gt; very long lived subscriptions where that initial cost gets amortized,\n&gt; it&#39;s less of an issue.  But in the absence of that info, and knowing\n&gt; that the method I need to use for subscription is POST (not PUT as with\n&gt; WebDAV LOCK), and so the chances of reusing deployed optimizations is\n&gt; nil, I&#39;d go for the new method.\n&gt;\n&gt; But it&#39;s not a huge deal, I could live with either approach.\n\nCoolness.
