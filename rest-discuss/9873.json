(Then you find HTTP Auth\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; credentials and a cookie with an ID in the same HTTP request,\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; so you know they belong to each other.)\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; No, that&#39;s not a good use of cookies. Here once again the\n&gt;  &gt; shopping cart needs to be identified by a visible URL, not a\n&gt;  &gt; cookie.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Addressability of the shopping cart is orthogonal.\n&gt;\n&gt;  The situation is this: an anonymous user started putting items in\n&gt;  a shopping cart. In the midst of her shopping tour, she realises\n&gt;  she was logged out, so she logs in. You do *not* want her to lose\n&gt;  the items she put in her shopping cart so far; you have to\n&gt;  associate that shopping cart with the account she logged in to.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Whether the shopping cart was explicitly addressable or hidden\n&gt;  behind a gateway URI is inconsequential. But if you want to do\n&gt;  it without URI rewriting, you *need* the cookie to associate an\n&gt;  anonymous user with a cart.\n\nOut of, curiosity what shopping sites use HTTP authentication, that\nyou no longer need a cookie after you log in?\n\nAssaf\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  Regards,\n&gt;  --\n&gt;  Aristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
