Bowman &lt;eric@...&gt;\n&gt; &quot;\n&gt; You don&#39;t get to decide what POST means -- that is decided by the\n&gt; resource. Its purpose is supposed to be described in the same context\n&gt; in which you found the URI that you are posting to. Presumably, that\n&gt; context (a hypertext representation in some media type understood by\n&gt; your client) tells you or your agent what to expect from the POST using\n&gt; some combination of standard elements/relations and human-readable\n&gt; text. The HTTP response will tell you what happened as a result...\n&gt; &quot;\n\nThe confusion, specifically in regards to this statement and\ncontrasting it with DELETE, is that POST is a much more &quot;wide open&quot;\nverb than DELETE. POST has an expectation of a media type argument,\nand has different behaviors. DELETE has none of these. There is no\npayload other than the URI, and there&#39;s no result other than success\nor failure.\n\nArguably, the availability of a DELETE link in the hypertext informs\nthe client that a DELETE is possible, but that is all.\n\nThe Standard Interface defines what the individual verbs do, but does\nnot define when they are or are not available. Just because everyone\n&quot;knows&quot; what DELETE does, does not mean that any and all resources\ncan, or should be deleted.\n\nYou could see an interesting argument between a server and a client\nwhen a client tells teh server to delete a resource, and then\ncomplains that the server actually did delete the resource rather than\nreturn an error. The server can say &quot;Why did you delete the resource,\nI&#39;ve never sent you anything that told you that you could.&quot; because\nthe server never sent a media type with a DELETE link in it.\n\nThus the distinction between Standard Interface and actual behavior.\n\nBut this is still confusing regarding non-hypertext media types,\nnotably common things like JPGs etc., which typically do not have a\nrepresentation that tells the client what it can and can not do. I\nguess the only way for this information to be conveyed would be on,\nsay, an index page.\n\nFor example: http://example.com/images can return a result listing all\nof the images, a link to POST to add an image, and individual links to\nPUT and DELETE all of the existing images.\n\nBut, clearly, you can not get this information by getting the resource\nitself, http://example.com/images/pic1.jpg, as that media type is not\nhypertext capable.\n\nI guess at this point you&#39;d need to rely on Link headers, but I don&#39;t\nknow the standardization status of those yet.\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n(willh@...)\n\n"}}
