Sounds like there is something that I&#39;m not grokking in what\nyou say. I understand the point about the caching intermediaries being\noptional. I also understand that access control doesn&#39;t affect\nscalability arising from statelessness. Not sure that I understand the\nfollowing: &quot;An alternative is to allow access checks to be processed\nlocally; this can be done if access tokens can be decrypted in place\nor rely on a shared secret.&quot;\n\nDo you mean that a client and server auth by using some form of PPK\ncrypto and embedding that in the payload? And if so, how does this\nhelp scalability?\n\nIn light of Stefan bringing this up, I was thinking some more about\nit. For full access control, you can&#39;t even have a local cache of\nsecured representations (in case authorization is revoked).\n\nHave to admit that I feel you are seeing something I&#39;m blind to.\n\nAlan\n\nOn Sat, Nov 8, 2008 at 9:33 PM, Bill de hOra &lt;bill@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Alan Dean wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Sat, Nov 8, 2008 at 8:48 PM, Stefan Tilkov &lt;stefan.tilkov@...\n&gt;&gt; &lt;mailto:stefan.tilkov%40innoq.com&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Slide 29: If the last bullet is supposed to say &quot;REST doesn&#39;t scale if\n&gt;&gt; &gt; access control is required&quot;, I disagree :-)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Really? I&#39;m interested to hear why.\n&gt;\n&gt; It assumes there&#39;s a central/sideline lookup to process each access\n&gt; token (&#39;sessions don&#39;t scale&#39;). An alternative is to allow access checks\n&gt; to be processed locally; this can be done if access tokens can be\n&gt; decrypted in place or rely on a shared secret. One can argue that access\n&gt; controls impact caching intermediaries, but they are an optional part of\n&gt; the architecture (i.e., an optimisation).\n&gt;\n&gt; Great deck.
