This WIP record\n&gt; had almost no validation rules. It just accepted inputs and whenever the\n&gt; user changed focus (moved between tabs, uploaded a files, etc.) it stored\n&gt; the data to the server.\n&gt;\n&gt; Once the user is confident all the data was entered properly, they can press\n&gt; the &quot;Create&quot; button to send the entire state representation to the server to\n&gt; process. The server then does all the needed validation and responds\n&gt; accordingly. If all goes well, a new &quot;official&quot; record is created in the\n&gt; system and the user is notified of success.\n\nMike,  you just described yet another instance of the\nprovisional-final transaction pattern.\n\n"}}
