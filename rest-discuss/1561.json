GET would allow a subscriber to get a snapshot of the topic&#39;s\nstate\n&gt; upon initialization.\nIf you are modelling messaging with resources, and the URI identifies the\ntopic or queue, I&#39;d use POST to &#39;add&#39; a message.\nDoing a PUT  on the topic itself would specify the complete state of the\ntopic.\nIf you have the URI of an individual message, then you could PUT the content\nof the message directly.\nYou may want to take a look at\nhttp://www.sourceforge.net/projects/destiny/ - it was an early experiment to\nexpose JMS via HTTP resources.\n\nAn interesting issue I have with modelling queues/topics is whether you\nactually /can/ model a &#39;Queue&#39; with HTTP.\nIf a Queue implies only one consumer of the message at the head of the\nqueue, how do you ensure one and only one consumer?\nIf you made the Queue a collection, and let every consumer get a list of\npending messages (a queue browser) then each consumer can directly access\nindividual messages and perhaps use some features of HTTP to sort of lock\nthe message. Perhaps a &#39;PUT&#39; to a &quot;message-id/lock&quot; sub-resource, or perhaps\na GET with an &quot;if-none-match&quot; header and using etags. I haven&#39;t had the\nspare time to chase this one down.\n\n\n\n"}}
