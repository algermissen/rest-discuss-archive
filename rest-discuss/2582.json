If the naming\n&gt; &gt; scheme changes, then so does the instructions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then you have to rename all of your old resources to follow \n&gt; the scheme, \n&gt; right? My point is that the naming convention for your new resources \n&gt; should not be constrained by history nor vice versa. And \n&gt; anyhow, except \n&gt; for web browsers, most web app client software is not really \n&gt; written to \n&gt; discover parameters at runtime.\n\nYes, and it clarifies that part of your &quot;first principles&quot; essay\nin that instructions for formatting query URI is not enough to keep\nquery stuff extensible.  Indirection is needed.  Is that a second\nprinciple?\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;...\n&gt; &gt; Okay, I get the indirection bit, but along the way I wondered\n&gt; &gt; how the client knew how to do that GET.  Did I tell her how to\n&gt; &gt; format that?\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, using something like WSDL or WRDL or XForms. In retrospect I was \n&gt; wrong to say that XForms MUST be used at runtime. There&#39;s no \n&gt; reason it \n&gt; isn&#39;t also useful at design time. I&#39;ll have to think about \n&gt; this aspect \n&gt; of XForms more...\n\nHere&#39;s what I want to happen.  Client does GET on /Portfolios/123 and\ngets back two things\n\n\t(1) default representation (as of now) of portfolio 123\n\t(2) Xforms form for requesting other version of portfolio 123\n\nBy filling in a date field in the form and following (or invoking)\nstandard Xforms protocol, a search URI is synthesized according to\nserver sytax rules and a GET performed on that...\n\nSounds reasonable?\n\n&gt;  &gt;...\n&gt; &gt; Hmmm.  I think you&#39;re still assuming that there is a finite\n&gt; &gt; number of these resources and that given the right question,\n&gt; &gt; the server can dish up a finite set of references for getting\n&gt; &gt; at them.  Time ain&#39;t like that.\n&gt; \n&gt; Surely your app is not interested in all of eternity. There \n&gt; are a finite \n&gt; number of changes that happen.\n\nIf you saw this app, you&#39;d understand that it&#39;s interested in\nall of eternity.  It&#39;s the one I referred to somewhere as choking\non its own transaction excreta.\n\nBut no, it&#39;s not interested in a timeline that extends infinitely\nin both directions, but it is interested in a time segment that\nhas infinitely many moments on it.  That&#39;s because it maintains\nbig bags of transactions, but no versions, so to find the &#39;as of&#39;\nstate, it has to go back to genesis and run history forward.\n\nThis has been a worthwhile exchange for me.  I was thinking last\nweek of writing a proposal for &quot;Versioned Portfolio&quot; design enhancement.\nThis adds fuel to the fire.  If Portfolio were adequagely versioned,\nthe query stuff would fall away entirely.\n \n&gt; It might be a valid engineering choice to short-circuit the \n&gt; query-redirect for simplicity or performance reasons. If so, \n&gt; I&#39;d suggest \n&gt; still to use query params rather than slashes for compatibility with \n&gt; today&#39;s Web and with languages like HTML, WRDL and XForms.\n\nOK.\n\n\nWalden\n\n"}}
