This will cause a URL to be generated of the format\n&gt;?col1=on&col3=on&col7=on\n&gt;This URI identifies a resource which is that particular permutation of\n&gt;column names. This can be easily rendered into HTML\n&gt;Of course, using a FORM literally might not be the most chrome looking UI,\n&gt;so let your script kiddies go nuts.\n\nCan&#39;t / don&#39;t want to reload this frame every time the link is checked.\nIt&#39;s a big tree and somewhat expensive to render. Could use javascript to\ngenerate the links on the fly, but that&#39;s also not necessarily desirable\nfrom a RESTful pov.\n\n&gt;b) use persistent data on the server to maintain state\n&gt;If this information should be long-lived, have the server maintain a URI\n&gt;that doesn&#39;t change and is unique for that user (in the same sense that a\n&gt;session variable is unique to a user). When the left hand panel POSTs data\n&gt;to that URI, keep updating the selected columns and return a\nrepresentation\n&gt;of the table with the users current set of selected columns.\n&gt;This is nice if the purpose of the app is to later use that selected &#39;db\n&gt;view&#39; in some way - perhaps to modify attributes (like &#39;max rows&#39; or\n&gt;something), as well as this approach makes that &#39;db view&#39; an identifable\n&gt;concept so you could do something like &#39;show me db #2 with view #27&#39;\n\nI think that&#39;s the one I&#39;d like to run with. Question is, what do the\nmechanics look like? When adding a column to a view, I issue a request\nsomething like:\n\nGET /view?task=add&var=foo\n\nthen I redirect the user to:\n\n/view?id=23\n\nwhich is the long-lived URL for the dataset view they&#39;re constructing. This\nsolution isn&#39;t entirely RESTful for two reasons, though, I think:\n\n1. I&#39;m not specifying the view id in the change request. Due to the fact\nthat I don&#39;t want to regenerate the link tree, though, this is largely\nunavoidable. I&#39;ll just store the user&#39;s active view id in their session,\nbut always redirect them to a URL which they can use absent a session.\n\n2. I should be using a POST request when changing the dataset view. There\nare two reasons why I can&#39;t/shouldn&#39;t though:\n\n  a. The change request is activated by a link, which can&#39;t issue a POST\nrequest unless use javascript links\n\n  b. You&#39;re not supposed to issue a redirect from a POST request\n\nAny thoughts on either the proposed solution or the (nitpicky) problems I\nsee in the solution?\n\n- donald\n\n\n"}}
