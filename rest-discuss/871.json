Renounce your heresy!\n\nNow see, this is what I&#39;m talking about re: dogma.  I seriously doubt you and\nMark have bothered to carefully read through that monster before starting in\nwith the indoctrination.  Don&#39;t bother, I&#39;m indoctrinated, but I&#39;m\nquestioning some of the basic precepts;  I&#39;m down with most of this stuff, I\njust don&#39;t buy the fish-on-Friday argument --- and I&#39;ve documented why!\nPerhaps you could be bothered to read it first so that I don&#39;t have to\nre-address questions or comments here that are already dealt with in the\ndocument?  Then we could discuss the specific and useful points rather than\nsimply writing off the whole endeavor as dogmatically inappropriate?\n\n;-)\n\n&gt; &quot;Web archiving is one example where computability of URI is useful and\n&gt; important.&quot; Well that&#39;s what query parameters are for. There is an\n&gt; exception to URI opacity in the web architecture already.\n\nBut this is problematic!  I *should* be able to e.g. use my caching proxy to\ncache /archive/2001/09/11 or whatever!  Shoving things into the query string\nisn&#39;t a good answer, each of those objects should be reified as a resource\nand addressible via URI.  THAT&#39;s what REST is about, IMO:  making everything\ninteresting referenceable.\n\n&gt; So I&#39;m sorry but I don&#39;t see much to reconsider in opacity. URIs should\n&gt; be human readable and guessable. Yes, but that isn&#39;t in conflict with\n&gt; the opacity principle.\n\nIt depends on how stringently you apply it.  There&#39;s very little guidance.\nTBL seems to have some informal notions of what makes &quot;good&quot; vs. &quot;bad&quot; URI,\nbut that&#39;s far from normative.\n\n&gt; URIs should sometimes be constructable from a\n&gt; base and parameters (though probably not deconstructable). Yes, but that\n&gt; isn&#39;t in conflict with the opacity principle.\n\nAgain, it depends on how stringently you apply the principle.  It&#39;s a\nwidely-misunderstood principle, I think, even potentially misunderstood by\nits author.  It&#39;s good to have a &quot;principled&quot; design and architecture for the\nWeb, but those principles should be meaningful.  In this case, I think the\nprinciple was derived in an ad-hoc fashion by some specific failures (i.e.,\ncontent types from extensions) early on, and is overly general.\n\n&gt; I still think it is a big\n&gt; mistake for *programs* to either deconstruct or guess URIs.\n\nWhy?  If I provided you with (RDF, whatever) that formally defined the\nstructure of names on my site and your code could deduce from that /\nautomatically generate meaningful names, why is this a bad thing?\n\nEnough dogma.  Check your premises! ;-)\n\nBottom line:  the Web insists on opacity --- there are no names, only\nidentifiers.  Everywhere else that syntactically similar entities are used,\nthe trend has been to increase rather than decrease the semantic richness of\nthe namespace.  Why the discrepancy?  Smart people exist in both\ncommunities;  a reasonable person looks at this discrepancy and attempts to\nunderstand what&#39;s going on here.\n\njb\n\n\n\n\n"}}
