I think resources are much more like large-grained very\n&gt; generic objects in that they have methods and identity.  Even the\n&gt; representation does not need to be limited to &quot;just data&quot; (unless we\n&gt; consider everything to be &quot;just data&quot;).\n\nI used &#39;data element&#39; because that was the term from Roy&#39;s dissertation.\nI think &#39;data element&#39; is a category of features of a networked\narchitecture - as compared with message flow or processing units/components\nor whatever.\nI would like to clear up the ambiguity though - how about:\n\n&quot;The REST documents describe networked systems in terms of three\narchitectural concepts: data elements, components and connectors.\nSpecifically, REST uses these instances of the concepts:\n data elements : resource, resource identifier, representation\n (etc...)\n&quot;\n\n\n"}}
