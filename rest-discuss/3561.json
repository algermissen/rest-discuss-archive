Fielding&quot; &lt;fielding@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; And to DELETE a URL is really only to DELETE a\n&gt; &gt; name.\n&gt;\n&gt; More assumptions about the implementation.  The method only signifies\n&gt; the action desired by the user agent.  How that is accomplished is left\n&gt; to the server implementation.  Some implementations will have garbage\n&gt; collection, others will delete on last reference removed, and still\n&gt; others will refuse a delete until the namespace is empty.  In any case,\n&gt; the client cannot delete the URI -- it can only see and manipulate the\n&gt; representation, and all it expects from the origin server is that the\n&gt; old representation is no longer available once the DELETE succeeds.\n\nWhen you say &quot;all it expects from the origin server is that the old\nrepresentation is no longer available&quot;, do you mean that no representation\nis available for the given URI or that a representation can still be\navailable after-the-fact, but the client can make the absolute claim that\nthe two representations (before and after the DELETE) are not the same?\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
