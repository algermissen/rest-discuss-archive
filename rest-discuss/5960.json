But, that Resource is expected to  \nchange unpredictably, and should presumably indicate as much in its  \nheaders, so that proxy servers et al can respond appropriately.\n\n From this perspective, Cookies are bad to the extent that they move  \nserver state *outside* the explicit naming hierarchy of URLs, and  \nthus outside the usual ecosystem of servers and proxies.  Yeah, it  \nworks, but its a bit of a kludge; I suspect that -- with what we know  \nnow -- we would&#39;ve been able to design something that better fits the  \nexisting architecture of the web.\n\nAt least thats my understanding.
