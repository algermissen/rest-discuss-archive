Why=\r\n does the client&#39;s viewpoint need to be divorced from the state \n&gt; of the e=\r\nntities?  What does it buy me (and what are the trade-offs)?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nRickard&#39;s biggest complaint in the article you reference is that\n&gt; &gt; many/m=\r\nost APIs that claim to be RESTful do not actually obey the\n&gt; &gt; hypermedia (=\r\na.k.a. HATEOAS) constraint, and include URIs for the client\n&gt; &gt; to use for =\r\ninitiating state changes.  In the shopping cart case, for\n&gt; &gt; example, the =\r\nrepresentation returned to the user should include the\n&gt; &gt; current state of=\r\n the cart (to obey the statelessness constraint),\n&gt; &gt; *and* a URI for the c=\r\nlient to use for initiating a checkout operation.\n&gt; \n&gt; That article didn&#39;t =\r\nseem to make any compelling reason to go with use \n&gt; cases, though.  The on=\r\nly thing I read was that figuring out which links \n&gt; to expose (from an aut=\r\nhorization viewpoint) is difficult to do.  Which I \n&gt; don&#39;t happen to agree=\r\n with.\n&gt; \n&gt; But it seems to be conventional wisdom to do this, so I&#39;m tryin=\r\ng to find \n&gt; out why.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
