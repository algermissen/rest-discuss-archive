However, the server may honour that request in any\n&gt;&gt; way=\r\n it chooses, incl. deriving parts of the new resource state\n&gt;&gt; from previou=\r\ns resource state. What=92s crucial, though, is that the\n&gt;&gt; client cannot as=\r\nsume that this will be the case, and the server\n&gt;&gt; cannot assume that the c=\r\nlient intended a partial update.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; ... I understand that for the inte=\r\nnt to be clear, there&#39;d have to be a\n&gt; new verb such as PATCH if *any* clie=\r\nnt should be able to express the\n&gt; intent of a partial update.\n&gt; And althou=\r\ngh it would be _OK_ for a server to handle a PUT with a\n&gt; &#39;diff&#39; differentl=\r\ny, this would have to be part of a server-specific\n&gt; out-of-band agreement =\r\n(and a generic client couldn&#39;t be held\n&gt; responsible).\n&gt;\n&gt; Or would you say=\r\n it&#39;s _wrong_ for a server to treat a PUT with a diff\n&gt; format this way?\n\nI=\r\nt is wrong.  A resource is not just the state -- it is also the\nmapping fro=\r\nm state to representation(s).  For example, you can have\none resource that =\r\nis my home page and a second resource that is the\ntext/html version of my h=\r\nome page, and those two resources are\ndifferent even if they have the same =\r\nrepresentation most of the\ntime and the same state all of the time.  A diff=\r\n is a representation\nof how to get from one state to another, not a represe=\r\nntation of\neither of those states.  Therefore, it is always wrong to &quot;patch=\r\n&quot;\nthe resource on a PUT of a diff, as opposed to setting the resource\nstate=\r\n to the diff.  That is why I introduced PATCH in the first\ndrafts of HTTP/1=\r\n.1.\n\nWhat Aristotle may have been referring to is the ability of a server\nt=\r\no take one state update (via PUT) and reflect that update in\nvarious ways o=\r\nn later GET.  That is because there is no correlation\nin HTTP between a PUT=\r\n and any subsequent GET other than that\ndescribed by the server itself (via=\r\n etags).  For example, if you do\na PUT of a diff in context (diff -C3) form=\r\nat, it is reasonable for\nthe server to later supply a different representat=\r\nion of that same\ndiff in the uniform (diff -u) format (assuming anyone ever=\r\n bothers\nto register the media types).\n\n....Roy\n"}}
