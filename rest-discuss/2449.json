A \n&gt; &gt;&gt;resource is a logical construct - a concept.  A resource may be backed \n&gt; &gt;&gt;by a document, and the bytes that comprise that document may correspond \n&gt; &gt;&gt;exactly to the representation of the resource, but the resource and the \n&gt; &gt;&gt;representation are never the same thing.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;m aware of the distinction, but I&#39;m questioning whether it has any\n&gt; &gt;practical value in cases where there is no transformation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; I guess I&#39;m not sure I understand what you&#39;re getting at.  What do you \n&gt; mean by &quot;there is no transformation&quot;?  I don&#39;t think you can (or should) \n&gt; say that a resource is transformed into a representation - that might \n&gt; imply many things that probably aren&#39;t true.  It might be better to say \n&gt; that a resource generates a representation.\n\nWhoa, not so fast there! We were talking about PUTting and POSTing\nthings *to* a server ... let&#39;s limit it to PUT for the moment. I\nunderstand that what lives at the URI is a resource; we are told that\nwhat you PUT to the URI is a representation. And--perhaps out of\nignorance--I&#39;m seeing conceptual and/or practical difficulties with that\nnotion. When you successfully put a representation, its contents become\nthe contents of a resource, right? And in that process, either those\ncontents can change form (e.g. from one XML vocabulary to another) or\nthey can&#39;t. If they can, then there&#39;s an issue of how to ensure that the\nserver receives something that can be meaningfully transformed --and I&#39;m\nwondering if REST has anything to say about that, or if it&#39;s left to the\napplication. \n\nIf, on the other hand, those contents can never change on the way to\nbecoming a resource, then why not say that you &#39;PUT a resource&#39;? Is\nthere any reason other than &#39;because that&#39;s not how a resource is\ndefined&#39;?\n\n&gt; The only entity that knows whether there is &quot;no transformation&quot; is the \n&gt; resource&#39;s implementation.  No other entity has any way to make that \n&gt; determination - nor do I see any value in trying to do so.  When you \n&gt; request a representation of a resource, why do you care how that \n&gt; representation was generated?\n\nQuite right--and my concern at the moment is how to implement those\nresources. If I were only considering things from the client side, I\nwouldn&#39;t care.\n\n-- \nMatt Gushee\nEnglewood, Colorado, USA\nmgushee@...\nhttp://www.havenrock.com/\n\n"}}
