MONITOR simply means: &quot;POST a notification to the\n&gt; : Reply-To URL if the state changes&quot;. I think of this notification\n&gt; : as being a representation of the new state.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m generally okay with that part.\n\n&gt; : &gt; \n&gt; : &gt; How would you describe the state transition (or transfer) that\n&gt; : &gt; occurs in response to a MONITOR request?\n&gt; :\n&gt; : This is beyond my REST-knowledge I think. Is it necessary that\n&gt; : this is doable? All I am sure of is that the response to MONITOR\n&gt; : will be a &quot;201 Created&quot; with a Location header identifying the\n&gt; : monitor.\n&gt; \n&gt; Depends on whether you&#39;re &quot;thinking&quot; or just &quot;tinking&quot;.  This list is\n&gt; an architecture discussion list, so I would say yes, it is necessary.\n&gt; \n&gt; So I&#39;ll reiterate it:  What resource state does MONITOR act on?\n\n\n\n"}}
