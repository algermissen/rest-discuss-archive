The coding problem was trivial, on the \norder of whether you should pull up your pants or your underwear first.\n\nI&#39;ve been meaning to open a conversation about RESTful design patterns \n(and maybe libraries) for a while, and I thought this was a good opener. \nTraditional toolkits and documentation for web programming are less useful \nin the context of REST, so many of us are evolving our own toolkits and \npatterns.  My question was intended to make those toolkits and patterns an \nexplicit issue.\n\n- Lucas\n\n\n\n\n"}}
