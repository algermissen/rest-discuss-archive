The goal in REST is to transfer a representation\nof application state, could be an entity, could be urlencoded.  Triggers\non PUT/POST are anti-patterns in REST.  The constraint is, &quot;manipulation\nof resources through representations&quot;.  Transferring a representation\nstate to an origin server can &quot;trigger&quot; anything, with visible semantics\n(the choice between methods is external to REST, and comes down to\nwhether you want idempotency or not).  Think of it this way, if it\nhelps -- PUT/POST chooses a handler, but you need to give it something\nto handle.\n\nGET may also be used as a trigger (i.e. a hit counter), provided it&#39;s\nsafe (the user isn&#39;t held accountable, unlike with unsafe PUT/POST).\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
