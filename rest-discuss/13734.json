By configuration ?  What if for the next round \n&gt; server4/someresource appears and can be used as well, how will server1 \n&gt; learn about it?\n\nEither because it&#39;s told about server2/someresource or it already knows, \nor it knows where to find out, or it&#39;s told were to find out.\n\nI don&#39;t know which would be more appropriate for what you are doing, but \nright now can&#39;t think of any way for any server of any sort to know what \nto do here beyond those four possibilities. REST can handle the telling \nit or telling it where to find out. If it knows or knows where to find \nout that&#39;s nothing to do with the interaction that is being done with \nanother server through REST (though in the &quot;knows where to find out&quot; \nscenario, that could involve another REST interaction).\n\n&gt; What would be the recommended solution for the federated AA for REST \n&gt; services?  Can you please point to an example of an existing REST \n&gt; system, making use of it?\n\nI understand OpenID is federated, but won&#39;t say any more beyond \nadmitting to much ignorance here.\n\n&gt; WWW works mostly because it is read-only for humans and human mind is \n&gt; used to select the next click.   The existence of links is defined \n&gt; either by the webmaster, or by search engines. How this translates to \n&gt; machines ?\n\nThis isn&#39;t true. The WWW is not read-only for humans, as we can do all \nmanner of things that affect the state of the server (Wiki&#39;s are the \nmost blatant example, but just about anything that receives a POST acts \non it, and doesn&#39;t throw away the result is an example). And we know \nwhich links to select next because of the information we are given about \nthose links.\n\nIt&#39;s precisely the same for machines. They know what a URI does based on \nwhat they are told in the representation in which they found it.\n\n&gt; In order to provide hypermedia links in the next response, one would \n&gt; need to be aware of them at least. This is easy if the entire REST \n&gt; system is on one server and it constructs the URI by some templates.  \n&gt; How a resource learns about links outside of their other domain?  Before \n&gt; search engines people used to send each other bookmarks and paste it \n&gt; manually into the browser - is this the recommended approach now?\n\n From your mail I&#39;m envisioning something like:\n\n1. Server A is responding to a request.\n2. This cases state in Server B to change, in a manner the client will \nbe interested.\nEither:\n3a. Server A is telling Server B what change to make and &quot;where&quot; to make it.\n3b. Server A is telling Server B what change to make and Server B is \ndeciding &quot;where&quot; to make it.\n\nIn which case either Server A knows the URI of the affected resource to \ntell the client about, or Server B can tell Server A after its done the \nchange, and Server B can pass this on to the client.\n\nAm I getting something very wrong?\n\n\n"}}
