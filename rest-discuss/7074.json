How does a web app get the DNS \n&gt;&gt; &gt; updated? (My experience trying to do this has all been on \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Windows Servers in the past, so  it might be easy on \n&gt;&gt; &gt; *nix, I dunno.\n&gt;&gt; This is not a REST question. It&#39;s a DNS question.\n&gt;&gt; For a DNS name to be resolvable it must be in DNS (ta daa!)\n\nI know it&#39;s a DNS question. So does that make it inappropriate to ask on\nREST-discuss?\n\n&gt;&gt; So you can either have a DNS that knows it always has to \n&gt;&gt; respond with details if the name matches a certain pattern; eg:\n&gt;&gt; mike.schinkel.somedomain.com CNAME www.somedomain.com\n&gt;&gt; or you have a registration process where you create a record.\n&gt;&gt; Either is possible with one of the programmatic DNS servers \n&gt;&gt; such as pdns. \n\nSo my question was really &quot;How to you programmatically update the DNS?&quot;\n\nSo I guess PowerDNS it to what you refer?\nhttp://packages.debian.org/unstable/net/pdns\nThat probably means hosting your own DNS.  I was hoping to find reasonable\npriced services that provided a REST intereface for updating DNS.\n\n&gt;&gt; Also, it&#39;s unrelated to what operating system you&#39;re using. \n&gt;&gt; This is a DNS issue not a unix or windoze issue.\n\nIt is a Unix vs. Windows issue if the only DNS you can find for Windows in\nnon-programmable.\n\n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n\n\n\n"}}
