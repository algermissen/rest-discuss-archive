Hopefully, I&#39;m not misreading WRDL (or REST), but if I\nam, I&#39;m sure someone will correct me.  :-)\n\nI also posted a fairly long message on the xml-dev list [1]. I didn&#39;t want\nto cross-post, but I&#39;d be happy to hear comments from folks on this list\nregarding the thoughts I offered.\n\nEveryone keeps fixating on the RPC aspects of SOAP. There seems to be this\nimplicit assumption that once you&#39;ve debunked SOAP-RPC, SOAP has nothing to\noffer. I disagree, and although I find these discussions about WRDL\ninteresting, I think it still fails to offer the sort of appeal that could\nwin some mindshare from the SOAP/WSDL crowd.\n\nThe simple XPath reliance is one notable example. Many SOAP toolkits are\nintentionally quite lean. Many use SAX, or use a pull-based variant of SAX.\nXPath matching is obviously problematic in such implementations.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that SOAP Encoding can be useful even if\nyou are not using RPC. SOAP Encoding has an implicit data model that is\nsimple, yet expressive; it can be easily mapped into the native data\nstructures of just about any programming language, and it is easy to\nserialize as XML. For those who are interested in exchanging *information*\nbetween applications and are more interested in the data model than its\nserialization format, SOAP Encoding can be quite convenient. It makes\nimplementation considerably easier when you want to model the messages with\nhigh-level APIs that are a natural fit for the programming language of\nchoice. I don&#39;t think this is a bad thing. It&#39;s essentially no different\nfrom what the RDF crowd is doing.\n\nI&#39;m thinking that WRDL needs something like a profile (or something similar)\nfor a certain class of web service that abides by some well defined rules to\nease implementations. This could offer similar benefits to the SOAP Envelope\nand Encoding rules. The profile could be designated by a well-known URI,\njust like SOAP Encoding. Implementations that are content to deal with just\nthat certain class of web service could easily round-trip between\nprogramming language constructs and the XML syntax without having to offer\nsophisticated schema-driven data-binding. Also, implementations could\nrecognize resource references and, ideally, differentiate between references\nto shared context vs. resources pertinent to the operation performed or the\nresource being addressed without having to support arbitrary XPath-based\naddressing into the message.\n\nThese are just preliminary thoughts, but I thought I&#39;d toss them out here\nand see what people think. Don&#39;t get me wrong, though. WRDL looks\ninteresting, and I&#39;m won to the notion that WSDL got it all wrong and that\nthe WRDL approach is on the right track. I just think that people are\nmissing the things about SOAP that genuinely appeal to many developers, and\nI think its worth addressing these things head-on and try to win some\nmindshare from the web service community.\n\n[1] http://lists.xml.org/archives/xml-dev/200202/msg01393.html\n\n"}}
