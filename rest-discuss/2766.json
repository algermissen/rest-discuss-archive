The slides are at [1] - I&#39;d be\ninterested in any feedback this group has to help me improve the talk. \n\nThanks especially to all the participants in this group (which I&#39;ve been\nlurking in for ages now :-)) for helping to shape my thinking on REST &\nSOAP. I&#39;m hoping that RESTful SOAP will start to gain traction as people\nfigure out that REST & SOAP can be complimentary and that RESTian\nthinking contains some important ideas.\n\n--Peter\nhttp://www.razorsoft.net/weblog\nhttp://staff.develop.com/peterd\n\n[1] http://www.razorsoft.net/weblog/2002/10/22.html#a362\n\n\n"}}
