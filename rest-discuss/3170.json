Alexander Jacobson&quot; &lt;alex@...&gt;\r\nX-Yahoo-Group-Post: member; u=4849001\r\nX-Yahoo-Profile: shop2it\r\n\r\nI think I have figured out how to do this in a way\nthat allows the server to move attachments to URLs\non other servers on an ad-hoc basis and that does\nnot require servers to maintain current view-state\nfor every client.  Please tell me if this solution\nis too HTTP abusive.\n\nInitially, the client makes a simple GET request\nto the URL of the mailfolder.  The server returns:\n\n  200 OK\n  Content-Type: multipart/digest; boundary=&quot;abc&quot;\n  Etag: my-etag\n\nNow, if the client want to receive only what has\nchanged since my-etag, it sends:\n\n  GET /folder/url HTTP/1.1\n  If-None-Match: my-etag\n  Accept: multipart/byteranges\n\nThe question is whether the server is now allowed\nto send a multipart/byteranges response.  RFC2616\nprohibits a 206 response if the client did not\nexplicitly make a range request, but I think the\nsemantics of content negotiation would certainly\nallow the server to make a 200 response with\npartial content if it so desired.\n\nWhat I would really like to do is have the server\nreturn a content-range header with a\nmultipart/digest response.  Is there a way I can\nmake that legal in response to a request with a\n&quot;accept-content-range&quot; header?\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n-Alex-\n\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
