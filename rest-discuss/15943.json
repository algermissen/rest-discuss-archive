There is no silver bullet approach - you have to consider the tra=\r\ndeoffs and decide what will work best for you.\n\nThat said, while I don&#39;t ha=\r\nve all the background into what you are doing, I can provide a few comments=\r\n based on what you&#39;ve provided.\n\n&gt; I&#39;m in a huge but _closed_ network, with=\r\n (almost) none interaction with the\n&gt; external internet.\n&gt; I&#39;ve to write a =\r\nquite complex application where I&#39;ve full control over the\n&gt; client and the=\r\n servers, but not the intermediaries.\n&gt; \n\nOk. So based on that I would say =\r\nthat if you think it would make things better, it is perfectly fine to use =\r\na custom hypermedia type if nothing else out there meets your needs. Essent=\r\nially, what you should do is adopt a convention something like: &quot;We will us=\r\ne IANA standard media types, plus the custom media types documented at inte=\r\nrnal URI X&quot;. I think this is ok for a closed system.\n\nAs an aside, for a &quot;c=\r\nlosed&quot; system, full-blown REST might also be overkill. But since you also d=\r\nescribed your system as &quot;huge&quot; then I could see REST still being useful.\n\n\n=\r\n&gt; Some of the clients are for humans (almost equally old browsers and\n&gt; sil=\r\nverlight applications).\n&gt; But many of the clients also work like (web) serv=\r\ners for other users\n&gt; (needing my data and elaborations for presenting them=\r\n).\n&gt; Some of those clients could, in the future go into the internet, but m=\r\ny\n&gt; application will not.\n&gt; \n&gt; Since I&#39;m not planning to write a protocol I=\r\n&#39;ve thought that I could use\n&gt; HTTP (that I know quite well).\n&gt; And since I=\r\n read RESTful Web Service it seemed to me quite a good approach.\n&gt; \n\nThere&#39;=\r\ns nothing wrong with using HTTP if your architecture is not fully RESTful.\n=\r\n\n&gt; Since we will write both the client and the server we are exactly in the=\r\n\n&gt; condition described from andrew:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; a) building a new kind of browse=\r\nr and associated media type(s); and b)\n&gt; &gt; designing &quot;sites&quot; for that new k=\r\nind of browser.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Ir seem that we &quot;easily&quot; adopt all the constraints =\r\na part from the media\n&gt; type standardization.\n&gt; \n\nAs I was getting at above=\r\n. &quot;Standard&quot; within your closed system is the next best thing and in my opi=\r\nnion still RESTful.\n\n\n&gt; This, paraphasing Fielding, would be &quot;less RESTful&quot;=\r\n that an application that\n&gt; would serve HTML.\n&gt; \n\nDepends on how you read i=\r\nt. Maybe &quot;less RESTful&quot; but not &quot;un-RESTful&quot; mainly because your system is =\r\nclosed.\n\n&gt; But, AFAIK (currently), it should be a small effort to make it m=\r\nore RESTful\n&gt; by simply providing &quot;filters&quot; that translate the custom mime =\r\ntypes in HTML\n&gt; or ATOM.\n&gt; \n\nI don&#39;t see why this makes it more RESTful (if=\r\n your clients are still using the custom mime types). It maybe be useful fo=\r\nr debugging and management purposes though.\n\n&gt; Moreover, since we will writ=\r\ne the client I think that we will use WADL as an\n&gt; hypertext language.\n&gt; Th=\r\nis becouse we will have a variable amount of representations lacking\n&gt; conn=\r\nectedness (they are like a plain gifs or bitmaps, and we will expose as\n&gt; b=\r\ninary data / json / xml as appropriate), one that will provide some\n&gt; conne=\r\nctions to other resources and the WADL itself.\n&gt; \n\nOk. This means that you =\r\nwont&#39; always have HATEOAS? Could be ok if you don&#39;t need it&#39;s benefits -- b=\r\nut it would likely help with the &quot;huge&quot; aspect of the system.\n\n&gt; I&#39;ll docum=\r\nent properly both the +binary, the +json and the +xml mimes.\n&gt; \n\nGood.\n\n&gt; P=\r\nrobably none of these home made mime types will become IANA registered\n&gt; st=\r\nandards (unless we will surclass both Oracle and Microsoft in the\n&gt; financi=\r\nal application development market).\n&gt; \n\nThat&#39;s ok if they are just standard=\r\n for your system.\n\n&gt; To make it &quot;more&quot; RESTful we would translate both the =\r\nwadl and the other\n&gt; connected mime type to HTML or ATOM and properly trans=\r\nform the unconnected\n&gt; resources in human readable html pages.\n&gt; \n\nAgain, n=\r\not sure this really makes it more RESTful but could still be a useful thing=\r\n to do.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Am I still missing something big?\n&gt; Could this be called REST=\r\nful?\n&gt; \n\nDon&#39;t get hung up on if this is RESTful or not. You should be more=\r\n concerned with having a good architecture that has the right properties to=\r\n meet your needs.\n\nAndrew\n\n\n\n"}}
