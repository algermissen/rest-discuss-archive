Believe it or not, I also agree that my answer may not be\ncorrect.  If I&#39;m not correct, I&#39;m the first person who wants to learn\nfrom it.  Thank you for keeping this debate framed around the technical\nmerits.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Then please, can anybody here give me a good reason why they&#39;d ever\n&gt; want to use a type that isn&#39;t registered being designed to be\n&gt; registered, or currently going the through the registration & review\n&gt; process?\n&gt; \n\nWithout resorting to arguments like pedantism, which may so easily be\nrebutted with accusations that your interest lies in using REST as a\nbuzzword, not in understanding it as an architectural style?  Please.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; If nobody actually has a reason to answer the above, then I fear Eric \n&gt; may be working himself in to an early grave for nothing, and\n&gt; hopefully everybody can move on.\n&gt; \n\nI don&#39;t actually consider it &quot;for nothing.&quot;  The last step in the\nunderstanding of any science, is being able to turn around and teach it\nto those who follow.  Can I truly understand REST without understanding\nthe community&#39;s en-masse rejection of the IANA registry?  Or is the\ninability to make this point, proof that REST isn&#39;t of use beyond being\na buzzword?\n\nWhat I&#39;d like to believe, is that in REST we have agreed to basic\ndefinitions of terms, to avoid exactly the passing-each-other-at-30,000-\nfeet problem we&#39;ve experienced here, as discussed in relation to SemWeb,\nhere:\n\nhttp://seanmcgrath.blogspot.com/2010/09/semantic-web-is-not-data-format.html\n\nBecause I think I&#39;ve touched on this being the &quot;point which is the\nsticking point for many who are dubious about the brouhaha surrounding&quot;\nREST, in my opinion.  The reason I have such a hard time dropping the\nissue, is that if REST can&#39;t be learned and can&#39;t be taught and thus\nhas no pragmatic value to Web development, I need to re-examine my\npriorities, i.e. my decision to specialize in REST, if it&#39;s just a\nbuzzword.  The science of it is where the appeal lies for me; but I\ndon&#39;t consider what can&#39;t be learned and can&#39;t be taught due to a lack\nof normative definitions, to be hard science.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; FWIW, I personally, can&#39;t think of any reason at all; and quite \n&gt; conversely would try to use registered, well known media types\n&gt; whereever possible, given all arguments, good common sense and with\n&gt; considerations for everything from web arch down to specific styles\n&gt; like REST.\n&gt; \n\nI find the inability to reach consensus on this issue, even when the\ncontext is limited to the Web, just as troubling from the CompSci\nperspective as Sean finds the portrayal of SemWeb as a new thing with\nnothing to learn from the existing body of AI work, to the point where\nthere&#39;s actually no benefit to be gained from participating in any\ndebates on the subject since nobody can agree to any definition of any\nterms -- we can&#39;t establish the semantics of self-descriptive, thus\nanything is self-descriptive, so what&#39;s the point of debating self-\ndescriptiveness?  Or any other constraint, if they&#39;re meaningless?\n\nMy last attempt on this issue, before deciding to limit anything I say\nabout REST to my own weblog (whenever that may go live), is here:\n\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/16602\n\nI would appreciate feedback on the metaphors.  The consequences of my\nbeing right on this issue, actually look like benefits to me, and while\nI think it&#39;s more appropriate to compare Roy to Stallman, as the spirit\nof standardization in REST is much the same as the spirit of the GPL.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
