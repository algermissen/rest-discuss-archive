It is, to be frank, a mouthful. Being,\nhowever, that it is the most important aspect of REST, it also\ncomes up a lot whenever I try to explain REST or discourse about\nit. Consequently, conducting such conversation is often awkward\nand straining.\n\nEven the corresponding initialism, HATEOAS, is less than easily\nhandled. Worse, the eye wants to read it as an acronym, and in\nthat capacity it starts with the uncomfortable sequence “hate”.\nIt almost reads like “hate oats”. Whether you read this is a\ncompound noun or a verb and noun – it does not for straight-\nfaced conversation make.\n\nSo here is my proposal: let’s shorten the awkward part of the\nphrase, “as the engine of”, to a single word meaning the same\nthing: “driving”. Now, any rephrasing is not going to put the\nfocus on “hypermedia” quite in the same way as Roy’s phrasing\nmanages to, which is the trade-off; in return, however, we get\na term that is much easier to incorporate into sentences:\n\n    Hypermedia-driven application state\n\nIf people start using this, I suspect that “application” will\nfrequently get shortened to “app”, which makes the phrase roll\noff the tongue even easier. In fact, read it out aloud:\n\n    Hypermedia-driven app state\n\nNotice that? It has a rhythm. Linguistically, this is important;\nit makes the term feel lightweight and natural to say, even if it\nhas a lot of syllables. I also like the form with “application”\nshortened because it keeps the weight of the term on the “hyper-\nmedia-driven” part, restoring some of the precision of Roy’s\nwording.\n\nFinally, this abbreviates as “HDAS” – which works excellently.\nNeedless to say it suffers none of the awkwardness of “HATEOAS”.\nBut being four letters also puts it into the sweet spot for\ninitialisms that people use. And there appear to be only obscure\nexpansions for “HDAS”, so the REST meaning should quickly become\nthe dominant understanding of the abbreviation.\n\nThis, therefore, is my submission: let’s start referring to the\nconstraint as “hypermedia-driven app state”.\n\nThe constraint has not received enough attention despite being\nthe pillar upon which REST, uh, rests; popular understanding of\nREST is nebulous at best as a consequence. We need to explain\nthis principle more and better, and it is my honest conviction\nthat the bulkiness of the established term is an impediment. We\nas REST proponents, of all people, should know the importance of\nnaming things.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
