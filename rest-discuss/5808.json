After that timeout, the client \n&gt; will clear the authentication for that realm. Each time they hit the \n&gt; site and I send back the auth prompt, I can move the timeout forward.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) Send in a response a directive to clear the authentication at a \n&gt; particular realm. This allows me to have a log out button integrated in \n&gt; the UI of the site.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) Send in the prompt a requirement that the user has to enter the \n&gt; credentials again, even if the authentication session hasn&#39;t expired, \n&gt; which enables me to make sure the real user didn&#39;t walk away and leave \n&gt; the browser logged in at a public terminal before I let them do \n&gt; something like look at and edit their personal data.\n&gt; \n\nYou do realize you don&#39;t have #1-3 now with cookies, right? The server \ndoes not control the client&#39;s behavior. The server can suggest to the \nclient that it do these things, but it is by no means guaranteed that it \nwill do so.\n\nIn practice, today, most existing widely deployed browsers cache \npasswords and usernames in such a way that timeouts are essentially \nirrelevant. Even if the server times out an authentication cookie, if I \nsit down in front of an unlocked screen with an open browser I can log \nright back in again. The browser will helpfully fill in the username and \npassword again.\n\nThe only control over this is, as it should be, at the client side. The \nclient can choose not to store the user name and password; and the \nclient can also choose to securely lock or erase the usernames and \npasswords for a site. However the server can&#39;t do this and is never \ngoing to be able to.\n\nThere&#39;s probably some way to implement an ongoing challenge-response \nsystem to verify users if you have really high security needs, but I \ndoubt Artima does. If I recall correctly, it doesn&#39;t even take credit \ncards or charge users. What you&#39;ve got is nice blog host, and the need \nfor user authentication is essentially for comments and new entries. \nSecure logouts don&#39;t seem a sine qua non for such a site.\n\n-- \nï»¿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n"}}
