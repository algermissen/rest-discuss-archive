The RESTful\n&gt; &gt; way to do this is not through sniffing, but media types.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I see nothing in the self-descriptive messaging constraint which\n&gt; requires markup-language versioning to be expressed via media type.  To\n&gt; me, REST is contained entirely within Dr. Fielding&#39;s dissertation,\n&gt; including the definitions of terms used to distinguish one\n&gt; architectural style from another.  There are other ways of doing\n&gt; things, but if they require any redefinition of Roy&#39;s terms in order to\n&gt; be considered RESTful, the disservice isn&#39;t being done to REST(tm), but\n&gt; to REST&#39;s usefulness as an evaluation tool.\n&gt;\n&gt; Nobody has to implement REST, but if your idiom is that of networked\n&gt; hypertext systems, an understanding of where you are deviating from\n&gt; REST and the consequences of same, is required.  We can&#39;t begin to\n&gt; discuss the real-world consequences of overloading media type to\n&gt; precisely capture the meaning of a hypertext interface, versus using\n&gt; media type to identify a codec, unless we can agree that these are two\n&gt; different approaches with different outcomes -- and thus worthy of\n&gt; separate definitions so we can have that discussion using precise terms.\n&gt;\n&gt; Which we can&#39;t do, if the starting point of the debate is that one of\n&gt; these approaches just isn&#39;t RESTful enough, despite meeting Roy&#39;s\n&gt; definition of self-descriptiveness, causing the discussion to degrade\n&gt; into accusations of pedantry and un-usefulness.  Do what&#39;s best for your\n&gt; system, whether the result is precisely RESTful or not isn&#39;t a value\n&gt; judgment, it&#39;s an evaluation tool.  Instead of attempting to redefine\n&gt; Fielding in an effort to attach the REST(tm) label, embrace REST the\n&gt; tool by using Fielding&#39;s definitions to explain what tradeoffs you\n&gt; made, and why you made them for the system in question.\n&gt;\n&gt; REST is an idealized model, if fewer people would set it as a goal with\n&gt; the naive expectation that real-world systems are even likely to fully\n&gt; comply, we&#39;d see less effort made to pass anything and everything off as\n&gt; RESTful.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If the client does request application/atom+xml and receives the\n&gt; &gt; extension, no harm is done because of atom&#39;s must ignore model.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Graceful degradation doesn&#39;t harm any clients, right.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If the client does request the extension via a custom media type, it\n&gt; &gt; expects to be able to process the response based on the Content-Type\n&gt; &gt; value returned.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Now you&#39;re talking about no degradation, as if the only clients that\n&gt; care about your payload are privy to your application.  Having an\n&gt; infinite number of finely-grained media types defeats the whole point\n&gt; of self-descriptive messaging by actually reducing visibility, again\n&gt; sticking with Roy&#39;s definition of terms.  One key to the successful\n&gt; scaling of the Web has been the small number of ubiquitous, coarse-\n&gt; grained media types.  This is a feature, not a bug; yes, there are\n&gt; disadvantages, but it&#39;s a tradeoff we&#39;re willing to make in REST:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;The trade-off, though, is that a uniform interface degrades\n&gt; efficiency, since information is transferred in a standardized form\n&gt; rather than one which is specific to an application&#39;s needs.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Whether you are willing to make the same tradeoff in your system is for\n&gt; you to decide, but it&#39;s incorrect to claim that using more application-\n&gt; specific media types makes the result more RESTful (or self-descriptive,\n&gt; or visible).  What this tradeoff allows, is for your system to scale by\n&gt; targeting the deployed architecture of intermediaries which do all\n&gt; sorts of wonderful things with your content based on the ubiquitous\n&gt; markup you&#39;re using, and simply don&#39;t care about understanding any of\n&gt; your domain-specific vocabulary.\n&gt;\n&gt; The reason fine-grained media types exclude intermediary participation,\n&gt; is because you&#39;ve tightly coupled client to server.  As designed (by\n&gt; which I mean coarse-grained), the concept of media types promotes loose\n&gt; coupling.  This has led to a proliferation of intermediaries performing\n&gt; every task under the sun nowadays, for billions of *different* systems\n&gt; using essentially *the same* small number of ubiquitous media types.\n&gt; Restricting intermediaries to only those which fully understand every\n&gt; last bit of domain-specific vocabulary your system uses, completely\n&gt; misses the point of REST as an architectural style, by lacking the\n&gt; key ingredient for meeting REST&#39;s scalability goal (ubiquitous media\n&gt; types).\n&gt;\n&gt; Profile attributes, otoh, offer a reasonable compromise by more fully\n&gt; describing the document semantics (not to be confused with self-\n&gt; descriptive messaging, currently the most prevalent misconception of\n&gt; REST out there imo) while still identifying the coarse-grained codec\n&gt; wire-speed clients (by which I mean intermediaries) need to determine\n&gt; if there&#39;s *anything* they can do with the payload, which likely has\n&gt; nothing to do with the specifics of your application.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Eric\n&gt;\n\r\n--f46d044796d951ce6f04c8a80989\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nJust wanted to say thanks very much to everyone that responded.
