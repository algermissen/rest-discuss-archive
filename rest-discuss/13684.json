I&#39;m still a bit confused though, so I&#39;m\n&gt; going to try to use an example:\n&gt;\n&gt; Let&#39;s say we have an client/ua that is filling out an order (order +\n&gt; line items). In a traditional web application, the order would be in\n&gt; the http session, and we would add/remove line items to that order,\n&gt; and finally place the order. In that case I clearly see that we are\n&gt; talking about application state that is placed on the server. The\n&gt; server keeps track of it, and it&#39;s literally the state of the client/\n&gt; application.\n&gt;\n&gt; But if we were to store and address the order like any other resource,\n&gt; would that change the nature of the state? It would simply be another\n&gt; way of storing the same state, but nevertheless it would be\n&gt; &quot;resources&quot; with the same properties induced by the stateless\n&gt; constraint (visibility, reliability, and salability) - given that they\n&gt; were stored in the a way that make that possible. To me, this looks\n&gt; like exactly the same kind of state (application state), simply stored/\n&gt; modeled differently. But in that case I don&#39;t see how or if it\n&gt; violates the stateless constraint.\n\nMaking that state addressable doesn&#39;t change anything.\n\nThe stateless constraint is being violated here because the meaning of\nthe message sent when any user hits a &quot;Purchase&quot; button on a page\nshowing an order is &quot;Purchase these line items&quot;, yet the message\ncontains no information about the line items, only a pointer (URI or\ncookie, doesn&#39;t matter) to some state held on the server.\n\nSee;\n\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca/blog/2007/11/users-and-self-description/\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
