I&#39;d say that a POST to\n/validator/username/ creates a new sub-resource of this resource?&quot;\n\nWell, the POST is stated as &quot;accept the entity enclosed in the request as a\nnew subordinate&quot;, but this is not a necessity. One of the examples the http\nspec talks about is &quot;providing a block of data, such as the result of\nsubmitting a form, to a data-handling process&quot;. Replying to a POST with a\n204 No content would imply that the validation of the enclosed entity (here\nthe username) has succeeded, without carrying the meaning of having created\nan entity.\nAnother advantage of the POST approach is that you could theoretically use a\n202 to &quot;lock&quot; that username for a few minutes, ensuring that no one else\nwould register it while the user continues the registration process.\n\nThe HEAD approach has the reverse effect, because a 200 or 204 would imply\nthe username already exists, a 404 that it doesn&#39;t exist. If what you want\nto check is the existence of that resource, I&#39;d be happy with a HEAD on\n/users/{username}, no need for having a specific validator resource. You can\nsimply try and get a resource, get a 2xx if it exists, a 404 if it doesn&#39;t,\nand a 400 if it&#39;s not acceptable.\n\nI think i&#39;m less happy with the /validator/username/{username} because you\ntry and access that resource, but if you return a 200/204 to say the\nvalidation has passed, returning a 404 would imply the validation result\ndoesn&#39;t exist, rather than the username being already taken.\n\n/validator/username?{username} defines this as a query against the\n/validator/username resource so i&#39;m happier with that, but this becomes very\nsimilar to doing a post against /validator/username...\n\nThen again I see POST as an instruction to the server to *do something*,\nwithout a very strong definition of what the something actually is.\n\n--\nSerialSeb\n\n\n"}}
