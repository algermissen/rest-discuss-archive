If you think about it, a browser speaks a general protocol \n&gt; defined by HTTP + media formats + the full URI space. Hypermedia puts \n&gt; constraints on the URI space and the HTTP methods that can be used on \n&gt; the URIs. It also puts constraints on the media formats for data that \n&gt; can be sent in a request using forms e.g. instead of just any old \n&gt; form-url-encoded data, it has to be something with the format: \n&gt; foo=&lt;foo_val&gt;&bar=&lt;bar_val&gt; because foo and bar are inputs in the form.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hypermedia is constraining the general protocol at each state in the \n&gt; client&#39;s execution rather than defining some entirely new protocol.\n&gt;\n&gt; Just my 2 cents...\n&gt;\n&gt; Andrew Wahbe\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &lt;mailto:rest-discuss%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Jim Webber &lt;jim@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Nick,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My main point is that the concept that &quot;Hypermedia Describes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Protocols&quot; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an illuminating variation on HATEOAS -- at least for two of us (Jim\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Webber\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and me).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I should say at this point (as Seb has) that my &quot;HATEOAS Describes\n&gt; &gt; Protocols&quot; mantra was deeply influenced by Ian Robinson&#39;s &quot;Good Web\n&gt; &gt; formats expose hypermedia controls&quot; theme. Fortunately Ian and I (and\n&gt; &gt; Savas) are writing this kind of stuff up in our book, so we hope\n&gt; &gt; something of a consistent theme will emerge.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Whether or not it passes muster with the eminent subscribers to this\n&gt; &gt; list remains to be seen however.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jim\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
