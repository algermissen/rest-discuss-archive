I\nthink REST is more than just a style and could better be described as\n&#39;architectural principals&#39;.\n\nIn architecture (the built environment) styles are essentially fads and\nfashions, principals are more fundamental aspects of form and structure.\n\nSome aspects of REST are accurately described as questions style, for\nexample the &#39;aesthetics of URI design&#39; but to sum it up as a &#39;style&#39; is\n(speaking as someone from an architectural background) a mistake that\nunder plays it&#39;s importance.   \n\nIMHO\n\nChris\n\n-- \nChris Croome                               &lt;chris@...&gt;\nweb design                             http://www.webarchitects.co.uk/ \nweb content management                               http://mkdoc.com/   \neverything else                               http://chris.croome.net/  \n\n"}}
