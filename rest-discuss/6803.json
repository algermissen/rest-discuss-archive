Class names become containers \n(URL segments), with instanc=\r\nes tagged by name/id as subfolders, and \ntheir subobjects as further append=\r\nages to the URLs. Properties \nbecome sub-resources with canonical operation=\r\ns. The expected \nresponses to GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE at a given resourc=\r\ne are \nlikely to be mappable with some occasionally customized regular \nexp=\r\nression tests. (SWIG?)\n\nAutomatically translating to REST might solve the f=\r\nollowing problems:\n\n1. Make migration to a better architectural style easie=\r\nr.\n2. Allow existing RPC-centric tools to be used while REST-oriented \ntool=\r\n sets mature.\n3. Force us to be more disciplined in distinguishing between =\r\n\ntheory/impl and major/minor aspects of REST&#39;s worldview.\n\nNow, before some=\r\nbody admonishes me that I haven&#39;t really grok&#39;ed \nREST if I believe a simpl=\r\nistic conversion will make these two idioms \ninterchangeable, let me be cle=\r\nar. I don&#39;t think this simplistic \nconversion could be fully functional. Th=\r\nere would be warts and \nproblematic non-equivalence. An RPC model manages s=\r\ntate, \nidentifiers, factories, and various other patterns differently from =\r\n\nREST. But if we could eliminate the &quot;noise&quot; in the differences \nautomatica=\r\nlly, what we&#39;d be left with are the nuggets that really \nmatter. And casual=\r\n experimenters with REST would quickly get some \nkey benefits -- no more st=\r\nateful sessions, looser coupling between \ntwo ends of a comm pipe, and an e=\r\nnd to the proliferation of methods \nand structures that have to be versione=\r\nd.\n\nDoes something like this already exist? If no, is it because I&#39;m \nbeing=\r\n bone-headed? If I&#39;m not crazy, is anybody interested in \ncollaborating on =\r\nsuch a tool?\n\n\n\n\n"}}
