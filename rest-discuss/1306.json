If I have a URI that is labeling a \nresource to which I can POST data to be processed, it is not good \npractice to include a file extension in that URI, correct?  In other \nwords, if I implement that resource using  ASP, JSP, ASP.NET, ..., I \nwouldn&#39;t want to betray that implementation detail, right?  It seems \nthat\n\nhttp://www.mycompany.com/purchaseOrders\n\nwould be better in than\n\nhttp://www.mycompany.com/purchaseOrders.aspx\n\nHow would this translate to all file extensions?  Its seems to me \nthere is an awful lot of .html, .asp, etc. labeling all sorts of web \nresources, and yet this seems to go against &quot;Cool URIs do not \nchange,&quot; etc.  To me this seems like a basic principle that is \nviolated everywhere.\n\nThanks,\nCasey\n\n \n\n\n"}}
