When designing an API, my concern is only those\nresources I control.  Since methods like PUT and DELETE have variable\nsemantics, it&#39;s impossible for all resources on the Web to have\nuniformly-defined semantics.  REST may be seen as an architectural style\nconsisting of constraints imposed upon the Web architectural style,\ni.e. HTTP is not REST.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; There are no application boundaries\n&gt; in terms of method semantics. DELETE means the same thing everywhere.\n&gt; It can’t mean one thing for one URI which happens to be part of one\n&gt; application and another thing for another URI which happens to be part\n&gt; of another. The semantics must be general enough that it means the\n&gt; same thing for all URIs.\n&gt; \n\nStrongly disagree.  In HTTP, PUT may mean either create or replace.  In\nAtom Protocol, PUT is constrained to mean replace.  In Protocol XYZ,\nPUT is constrained to mean create.  Both protocols use HTTP, both\nprotocols are RESTful, but PUT has different semantics within each \napplication boundary.  PUT cannot possibly mean the same thing for all\nURIs, since PUT means two different things.\n\nWe&#39;ll never get DELETE to mean the same thing everywhere, even within\nthe HTTP protocol (see again the WebDAV definition of DELETE compared\nto the Atom Protocol definition of DELETE).  The best we can do is\nagree that it has a generic-interface meaning, and design our APIs\naccordingly, regardless of what the RFCs involved allow.\n\nThe only method which fits your criteria, that it must unambiguously\nmean the same thing for all URIs everywhere, is GET.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
