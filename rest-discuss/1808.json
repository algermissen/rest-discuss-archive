Last time around we resorted to source/sink to have clear language \nin this setting.  What I&#39;m thinking of is the TURN/ETRN functionality you \nmention below.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; * event mechanisms.  given a single unidirectional connection there is no\n&gt; &gt; way for a server to initiate an event, short of the knownow hack of\n&gt; &gt; running events along the backstream to the client.\n&gt; \n&gt; Right, but I wouldn&#39;t call it a hack.  It seems a fundamental feature\n&gt; of the generic interface that a client can request events with GET, as\n&gt; long as those events stop when the connection drops.\n\nYes, but if the events are themselves requests you are tunnelling http in \nhttp.  If that&#39;s not evil I wnat to know why not.\n\n&gt; &gt; On the other hand, the new design would be HTTP to the letter, because\n&gt; &gt; HTTP doesn&#39;t say anyting about the socket layer.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m a bit wary of the above description.  IMO, not working with existing\n&gt; proxies is definitely an issue.\n\nTo the degree that it matters, it is a doable change to modify (some but \nnot all) existing proxies.  One thing at a time.\n\n&gt; Have you considered an HTTP extension method similar to SMTP TURN/ETRN\n&gt; for turning the connection around?  I guess that might not be sufficient,\n&gt; since it just flips it, it doesn&#39;t permit bi-directional comms over the\n&gt; same socket simultaneously - but I don&#39;t know for sure until I see some\n&gt; use cases.\n\nAs always, I really really object to adding new methods.  There&#39;s a reason \nwhy I want to go _below_ HTTP to make mods like this.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; And FWIW, you could specify this as a new protocol, but it would be a\n&gt; new protocol, not HTTP, though you could reuse lots of HTTP.  But if you\n&gt; read through Section 8 of 2616 while thinking about true 2-way over a\n&gt; single connection, you&#39;d see that the complexity of both specification\n&gt; and implementation (i.e. wouldn&#39;t be able to reuse any existing HTTP\n&gt; library) would probably be nasty.  *Much* simpler extensions, such as\n&gt; draft-mogul-http-ooo-01.txt (out of order responses in pipelining), had\n&gt; this same problem with existing libraries.\n\nYou have to specify it as a new protocol because it would break existing\nimplementations.  However I read the spec fairly carefully to find\nanything about this new protocol that was in conflict and found absolutely\nnothing.  The RFC requires nothing at at the transport layer.\n\nMy working plan is to use the HTTP Upgrade: response header with a value\nfor the new protocol of &quot;AC-HTTP&quot;.  &quot;AC&quot; meaning &quot;alternating current.&quot;\n\n&gt; Alternately, you could use CONNECT to create a tunnel, and then the\n&gt; server could tunnel HTTP back through.  That would probably be simpler,\n&gt; but firewalls don&#39;t typically honour CONNECT, IIRC.\n\nPlus you still have the rest of the problems to face.  EG, \nincompatibility.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
