But I\nkeep bumpi=\r\nng into cases where it looks like I need to alter the state\non  more than o=\r\nne resource in one hit. \n\nHere is a simplified example:\nSuppose there are r=\r\nesources where a particular attribute must be\nunique across the set of all =\r\nthose resources. If A has color red, then\nB cannot have color red. Now imag=\r\nine it needs to be possible to swap\nthe state of two resources with respect=\r\n to this attribute. If I start\nwith \n\nA.color=3Dred   and  B.color=3Dgreen\n=\r\n\nI need to end up with \n\nA.color=3Dgreen   and  B.color=3Dred\n\nIn order to =\r\npreserve the requirement of uniqueness, I want to do this\nin a single hit.\n=\r\n\nTo me this looks like I have a single URL, which I pass state for both\nA a=\r\nnd B to, and it changes the state of both.\n\nThis doesn&#39;t match the way I re=\r\nad the REST theory, but I can&#39;t come up\nwith a way does. Any thoughts on ho=\r\nw to make this closer to theory? Or\nis this one of those areas where you ju=\r\nst have to bend the rules?\n\nKevin\n\n\n"}}
