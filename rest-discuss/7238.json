For normal introspection purpose, it seems recommended\nto use OPTIONS to get Allow header with changing the application state. \n\n&gt; How to generate URIs? Well that&#39;s defined in a POST right? And the\n&gt; POST should be declared in an HTML FORM which you&#39;ve read with a GET\n&gt; on the parent resource. It doesn&#39;t have to be HTML... though you could\n&gt; possibly use content-negotiation to force an HTML representation. A\n&gt; FORM is also a microformat, so I&#39;d expect to see one in XML sometimes.\n\nI was also thinking of URIs with dynamics segments, URIs with query strings\nnot encoded like HTML Forms (application/x-www-form-urlencoded), URIs using\nmatrix-style encoding for parameters, etc.\n \n&gt; The input to a POST should either be a bunch of parameters (defined in\n&gt; the FORM with INPUTs) or some mime type that makes it obvious what to\n&gt; send.\n\nPersonally, I prefer to rely on WADL rather than HTML Forms to provide such\nmetadata. It&#39;s easier to process, allows any HTTP method (HTML Form are\ncurrently limited) and supports more URI formatting styles.\n\n[...]\n \nBest regards,\nJerome Louvel\nhttp://www.restlet.org\n\n\n"}}
