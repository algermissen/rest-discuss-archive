However, Nick&#39;s\nlist of properties for SOA is consistent with IBM and MS marketing.\nWhen has SOA ever been described as constraining anything?  The  \nreasonable\nconclusion is that SOA is neither an architecture nor a style, but\nrather a set of goals that can be sold to overmatched CIOs regardless\nof the corresponding architecture or implementation.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
