The better self-describing nature\nof the messages should make for interesting uses, especially in\nrouting, as it will be obvious what a representation on-the-wire\nwill be for.  Currently, the difference between a POST response and a\nGET response requires context from the connection on which the request\nwas made.  Decoupling that further will be nice, though, like I said\nbefore, implementation complexity could get nasty.\n\n&gt; Walden\n&gt; \n&gt; PS - just to let you all know that I&#39;m jobless since last Friday, and\n&gt; employment leads are appreciated.\n\nSorry to hear that, Walden. 8-(\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.
