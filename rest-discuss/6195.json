I was just having a conversation with my\n&gt; coworker (we run a big e-commerce site) about how torn we are about\n&gt; having to use cookies. It seems like a necessity. We used to do\n&gt; sessioning in the url but users would copy and paste their url to their\n&gt; friends. Now their friends would jump into their session and potentially\n&gt; be able to buy things on their credit card (yeay one click shopping) and\n&gt; cause all kinds of problems. Does ReST address this?\n\nI&#39;ve said this quite a lot recently.\n\nI don&#39;t believe there&#39;s anything wrong with cookies.\n\nWhat is wrong is using a cookie to manage a session with data hidden\nin the session on the server side.\n\nUsing a cookie purely client side, or using a cookie like an extension\nheader in HTTP is perfectly ok.\n\n\nWith this in mind there&#39;s no webapp that REST can&#39;t model.\n\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
