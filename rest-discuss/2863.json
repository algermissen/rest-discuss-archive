But I think the Web has\n&gt; shown that these sort of &quot;local islands of closed-worldlyness&quot; are\n&gt; spurious as they succumb to the network effects inherrent in the\n&gt; integration, anywhere, anytime approach of the Web.\n\nIf there were always &quot;network effects inherrent in the integration, \nanywhere, anytime approach of the Web&quot; then I&#39;d have to agree with you. \nBut this is really the point at issue. I&#39;m not at all convinced that \nthose network effects are always there. Or if they are, their combined \nwith a whole bunch of other effects which pull in the opposite \ndirection. \n\n&gt; As an example of this, I recently wanted to reference a Merriam\n&gt; Webster definition of a word, but noticed that their primary\n&gt; interface to their dictionary was via POST, not GET.  They do have a\n&gt; GET interface, which I later found, but that&#39;s not obvious to people.\n&gt; So dictionary.com is now the defacto english language dictionary on\n&gt; the Web since its primary interface is GET.  Goodbye M-W.\n\nDo you have any evidence that this is a &quot;GET vs. POST&quot; issue rather than \na &quot;dictionary.com is easier to spell than miriam-wibster.com&quot; issue? Or \nbetter content? Or a better UI (in ways orthogonal to REST)?\n\n&gt; There&#39;s also the simple maintenance issue that it&#39;s cheaper to update\n&gt; one interface than two, so if you&#39;ve got a service exposed to the\n&gt; world via HTTP, then you might as well use that even for private\n&gt; agreements.\n\nNot necessarily. Simple maintenance is often evolution (I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve \nhad the experience of a bug fix requiring a non-backwards compatible \nchange). Evolution needs agreement, and it&#39;s easier to get two parties \nto agree to a change than three ... or three hundred.\n\n&gt; &gt; OTOH, on the common interface model every change requires global\n&gt; &gt; renegotiation and reimplementation; and new particpants either have\n&gt; &gt; to get along with what the first-movers already decided on whether\n&gt; &gt; or not it&#39;s fully appropriate for them, or alternatively simply not\n&gt; &gt; become participants at all (or become participants in something\n&gt; &gt; else).\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, which is why incrementally deployed extensions are an absolutely\n&gt; must.  The Web has no &quot;off&quot; switch.  HTTP, and things like RFC 2774\n&gt; (which improved on that), were designed exactly for this.  Waka will\n&gt; be even better, by the looks of it, with built in scoping and\n&gt; mandatory extensions, like PEP and SOAP.\n\nAgreed completely ... which is why Waka is a new protocol rather than an \nextension of HTTP.\n\nCheers,\n\n\nMiles\n\n"}}
