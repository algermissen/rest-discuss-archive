Programs that act as both HTTP clients and servers are rare. \nUsually I&#39;m either writing a client or a server, not both.\n\nIf RESTlet were a pure server API, it would be simpler and I could learn \nit and work with it faster. Ditto if it were a pure client API. I&#39;m \nunlikely to want both at the same time in the same program but because \nyou&#39;ve tried to cover both use cases in the same product , it&#39;s become \nquite a bit larger than it needs to be. The learning curve is not \nlinear. Complexity grows faster than the API footprint.\n\nNow are there times when I want both? Yes, as you point out; but it \nwould be easier if I could learn them separately and treat them as \nseparate pieces. Or if I could easily use one but not the other. For \ninstance, I might want to use RESTlet for the server side but Apache \nHTTPClient for the client.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
