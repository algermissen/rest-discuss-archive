Box&#39;s definition of &quot;Hi-REST&quot; is essentially WebDAV, which says\n&gt; to me he really doesn&#39;t get it (or at least didn&#39;t six months ago.

I am in the process of writing a\nfully compliant REST-engine (hence my occasional questions to the\ngroup about certain protocol specifics) but being hi-REST is\nnon-trivial (at least it is when developing in .NET - I can&#39;t speak of\nother environments).\n\nAlan Dean\n\n"}}
