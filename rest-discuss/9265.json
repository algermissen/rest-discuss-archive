Bowman&quot; &lt;eric@...&gt; writes:\n\n&gt; Since I&#39;ve never pursued web services / SOAP I&#39;m never sure how useful it\n&gt; is to try to explain REST in SOA terms. But I have to disagree with the\n&gt; example URL given in the article.\n&gt;\n&gt; http://humanresources.com/benefits?user=&lt;USER_SSID&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; If it had stopped there it would make sense. But then &quot;type&quot; is added to\n&gt; the end and REST goes out the window, because if user 123-45-6789 becomes\n&gt; a part-time employee and later retires then his URL will change twice.\n&gt; The status of the employee is exactly the sort of thing which belongs in\n&gt; the response body, not the URL.\n\nI don&#39;t think it is that clear-cut. The doc does not say that\nparameters are used for intersection filtering instead of union.\n\nThat is, benefits?user=alice&type=full_time_employee, could mean either:\n\n1. The intersection of user-specific and a group&#39;s benefits.\n\nIf Alice is actually not a full time employee, but a part of the\nexecutive group (in many companies, executives are in a different\ngroup than other full-time employees), and she wants to know what\nbenefits are common between her executive group membership and other\nlesser employees, she could use that query too. This makes sense\nbecause a system can always derive a user&#39;s employment type and one\ncan argue that putting type into the query is not because the system\ncannot do the derivation itself, but because you want to prevent the\nderivation (supply the value yourself).\n\n2. The union of user-specific and a group&#39;s benefits.\n\nThe other way to interpret the query is: a user parameter shows\nspecial benefit for the user, and the type parameter shows the group\nbenefits. If Alice is a full time employee with a special benefit of\nhaving $1K stock option, then to see her total benefits, she would\nhave to specify both user and type params. This is a case where the\nsystem does not attempt to do derivation; does not try to be smart,\nwhich is a feature I wish some softwares do not do.\n\nSo, if anything, it&#39;s the article being not clear on the purpose of\nthe parameters.\n\nYS.\n\n\n\n"}}
