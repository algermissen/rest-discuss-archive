You should clarify one aspect of it, though.\n&gt; Do you mean that (say, over a given time period) GET(URI1) *always*\n&gt; yields Representation1, and likewise for URI2/Representation2?\n&gt; Or do you  mean that via observation, we have just seen the scenario\n&gt; below played out once?\n\nWell, to keep it simple(?), let&#39;s stick to the &quot;always&quot; scenario.\n\n&gt; You are asking questions of the nature What may two people claim?\n&gt; and What allows knowledge?  Are these the questions you mean to\n&gt; ask, or do you mean to ask questions about the constraints in REST?\n\nWell, a bit of both, really.  The first bit has to do with whether a single\nclient can know the commonality of two URIs that point to the same resource.\nFor example, there is this resource somewhere and it has two URIs\nreferencing it.  How can a client assert that these two URIs reference a\nsingle resource?  It seems to me that the answer is you can&#39;t necessarily\nknow.  It is possible, though, that the semantics of a particular\nrepresentation (e.g. RDF document) could allow such understanding, but that\nwould be specific to that resource and not generally applicable to all\nresources.  In other words, each resource would have to explicitly tell the\nclient in a potentially proprietary way of the relationship of its URIs.\nBut there isn&#39;t anything at a more generic level (say HTTP, for instance)\nthat allows this to be known.\n\nThe other part is whether it is possible for two clients to assert that they\ntalking about the same single resource if neither of them share an\nidentifier (URI).  It seems to me that they cannot.  Period.  Which gets me\nback to the first question... if a single client does not have a mechanism\nto find that two different URIs are of the same resource, then it is in the\nsame seat as the two clients that do not share a resource.\n\nNow, maybe this is beyond the scope of REST.  I really don&#39;t know.  Or maybe\nthe problem here is that HTTP&#39;s implementation of REST is not complete in\nthis matter.  Or maybe this is a red herring that&#39;s just confusing issues\n(no, I really don&#39;t know if it is or not).\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs (seairth@...)\nLooking: http://www.seairth.com/blog/65\n\n\n"}}
