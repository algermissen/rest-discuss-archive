On to the examples ...\n\n&gt; &gt; In the stateless case, you could just take the offending message to\n&gt; &gt; court and leave everything else behind, because its meaning is\n&gt; &gt; independant of any conversation it may have been sent in.\n&gt; \n&gt; Depending on what you mean, that gets tricky.  \n&gt; Simple case:  shipment notification is dependent on order line which \n&gt; it purports to fulfill.  Claims of non-fulfillment would need both \n&gt; the shipment notification and the order line.\n\nOk, I see what you&#39;re getting it.  It&#39;s not any profound issue, it&#39;s\njust a misinterpretation of what I was saying about only needing to\ntake one message to court.\n\nIn fact, you always need to take two things to court; the contract,\nand proof of breach.  My point, which was obviously poorly stated, is\nthat proof of breach can be demonstrated with a single message (the\nshipment notification, as I understand what one is).  Of course, proof\nof a entering into a contract should also be able to be demonstrated\nwith a single message too.\n\n&gt; More complex case:  non-fulfillment is covered by a long term \n&gt; contract which provides penalties.  So now the long-term contract \n&gt; clause must be stated as well.\n\nOk, but the messages that establish expectation of fulfillment, and\nnotify about fulfillment both mean the same thing independant of the\ndetails of any contract that exists.  But its meaning *does* depend\nupon the existence of such a contract, so you&#39;d want to reference it.\nPresumably any standard format for this info would have a way to\nreference one or more non-fullfillment contracts - is that the\ncase?\n\n&gt; Are these ideas relevant to the issue raise?\n\nYep.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
