If you are doing this, then you should allow\n&gt; &gt; notification messages to specify alternative\n&gt; &gt; servers (preemptive redirect).\n&gt;\n&gt; I may do that but it is also easy to do that at the application\n&gt; layer...anyhow, I call it &quot;watched-URI&quot;. You call it\n&gt; preemptive-redirect. It&#39;s a URI where you can get the resource.\n\nIf watched-URI is optional, then I don&#39;t have a\nstrong objection to it.  I just want to make sure\nthat systems work properly with trivial\nimplementations.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I guess I&#39;ll take it out and see if a need for it arises. My main\n&gt; &gt; &gt; concern is that while you are retrying one event you don&#39;t want to build\n&gt; &gt; &gt; up a larger and larger queue of events you are retrying for the same\n&gt; &gt; &gt; missing subscriber until you start to interfere with network\n&gt; &gt; &gt; performance.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If the client misses notifications, that is OK.\n&gt; &gt; Why not just drop them?\n&gt;\n&gt; What if the notification is for an important email that just arrived?\n&gt; Late is better than never. Retry is just a MAY. If a publisher doesn&#39;t\n&gt; want to implement it, they don&#39;t have to. Depends on the\n&gt; mission-criticality of the application.\n\nOK.  But if notification bodies are optional, then\nyou don&#39;t need to accumulate a queue of update\nmessages for the client.  You just need to send\nthe last one.\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Paul, this thing should be really easy to\n&gt; &gt; implement.\n&gt; &gt; The pure URI version with message dropping allowed\n&gt; &gt; means that each time a watched resource is changed\n&gt; &gt; it just iterates through a notification list\n&gt; &gt; issuing ___ requests with no content.\n&gt;\n&gt; Versus tagging each URI with &quot;Watched-URI: $uri &#92;nSubscription-URI:\n&gt; $sub_base?$uri&quot;. It&#39;s not hard either way.\n\nIt is harder because then server implementations\nMUST know what their URI is.  I&#39;ve seen too many\nserver environments where you don&#39;t.\n\n&gt; &gt; I think this gets you almost everything you want.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Adding all sorts of negotiation seems annoying.\n&gt;\n&gt; A few flags are not a major deal. We&#39;re talking about implementing in\n&gt; two hours or three!\n\nAs long as support for negotiation isn&#39;t\nmandatory!\n\nI want subscription to be as simple as\n\n  POST /foo/bar/subscription HTTP/1.0\n  Subscriber: http://myserver/foo/bar/handler\n\n\n----\nNote in reading the spec. again I think the big\ngap is actually in acquiring the subscription\nresource!\n\nFor example, you might want a polling server to\nnotify you of changes to a resource even if the\nunderlying resource server is not implementing\nthis protocol (and therefore doesn&#39;t send a\nSubscriptions: header).\n\nRather than having a resource issue a\nSubsriptions: header, it makes much more sense for\na subscription to issue a &quot;location:&quot; header\npointing to the underlying subscribed resource.\n\nEven better, it should issue a location-regex:\nheader.  That way you could watch collections of\nurls that match a particular regex or set of\nregexes.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
