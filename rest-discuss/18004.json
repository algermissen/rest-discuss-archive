designer can, for example, &quot;bake in&quot; a design element (which all\n&gt; clients/servers must support) that signals a &quot;MustUnderstand&quot; rule.\n\nas a corollary to what i just said: i was thinking about, let&#39;s say in \nXML/XSD terms, a global attribute you can put on elements to signal \nthat. but oftentimes, a version attribute somewhere does this for all of \nthe representation, effectively disallowing a client to continue to \nproceed if it encounters an unknown version. the big disadvantage of \nthis &quot;document-level attribute&quot; is that it disallows the use of \n*everything*, including old stuff that still might be safe to use for \nthe client. which is the reason why version attributes often are a bit \ntoo disruptive in a loosely coupled scenario.\n\nanother approach to this would be to remove this from representation \ndesign altogether and use relations to communicate extensions, something \nthat has been discussed by mark nottingham in his recent blog post \nhttp://www.mnot.net/blog/2011/10/25/web_api_versioning_smackdown . you \ncould possibly extend his method to also qualify those links as being \nmandatory or not. the link-based extension mark proposes is an \ninteresting approach, but doesn&#39;t work too well in cases where \nextensions need to be put in certain places in existing representations \n(think documents instead of data), instead of just being a bag of \nadditional data clients can get to, if they want to get it.\n\ncheers,\n\ndret.\n\n-- \nerik wilde | mailto:dret@...  -  tel:+1-510-2061079 |\n            | UC Berkeley  -  School of Information (ISchool) |\n            | http://dret.net/netdret http://twitter.com/dret |\n\n"}}
