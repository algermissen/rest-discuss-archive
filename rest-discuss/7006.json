The\n&gt; &gt; web is a living thing - you have to consider the formal constraints of\n&gt; &gt; the specifications but you&#39;re fooling yourself if you think you can\n&gt; &gt; disregard the constraints created by the way the web has evolved on\n&gt; &gt; its own.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think the act of fixing the design bug with early Rails apps not\n&gt; playing well with others is the actual evolotion of the Web that you\n&gt; mention. Survival of the fittest and all that - clearly the deletion\n&gt; of content due to the faulty Rails design wasn&#39;t a successful mutation\n&gt; and it has died on it&#39;s own so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to say the &#39;web\n&gt; evolved&#39; when really just one application was born that couldn&#39;t\n&gt; survive in the wild. Now it can.\n\nThere was no design bug with Rails the framework. The issue was bad\napplication design and was (and is still) fairly widespread. You&#39;ll\nfind the same issue in web applications built with anything. I don&#39;t\nknow of any environment that can enforce safe GET; it doesn&#39;t seem\npossible.\n\nBut if we broaden out the scope of your statement and say that GWA was\na kind of agent for positive change that removed a lot of icky stuff\nfrom the gene pool, I concur. \n\nI guess what I was trying to say is that you ought to learn as much as\npossible about the &quot;principled design&quot; [1] of the web and strive to\nmeet it, but always have your nose in the goings on of the\nViewSourceClan [2].\n\nOver time, things like GWA have a compounding positive effect on the\nweb but they come at the price of severe short-term compatibility\nproblems. It&#39;s just one more thing you have to weigh with an overall\ndesign and there&#39;s no silver bullet.\n\n[1] http://www.dehora.net/journal/2006/11/here_we_go_again_1.html\n[2] http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/ViewSourceClan\n\n--\nRyan Tomayko\nhttp://naeblis.cx/\n\n"}}
