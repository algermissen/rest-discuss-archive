It is far\n&gt; easier to distribute, version, QA, ... such a single item of work than\n&gt; a wild bunch of unrelated specs for extensions and link relations.\n\nLet&#39;s recognize that there are two orthogonal concerns that need to be\nconsidered here: What&#39;s good/easy/convenient/effective for the developer\nvs. the user (&#39;user&#39; here being any active element on the Internet).\n\nOn one hand, I agree that a custom media type often can have advantages\nfor you as the software developer, for exactly the reasons you describe.\n\nOn the other hand, using only standardized media types supposedly can\nhave scalability (performance and adoption) advantages.\n\nWhich concern is more important to you? It may depend on your particular\napplication and situation.\n\nAs others have pointed out: Custom media types do work, the Internet\ndoesn&#39;t come to a screeching halt and most intermediate nodes know how\nto deal with them in a sufficient best effort way. In the real world,\nthey simply aren&#39;t as bad as some like to claim. They may also make\nserver and client development easier and more manageable, which is an\nimportant point.\n\nJust recognize that using them may not be as effective for the Internet\nas a whole, or for the performance of intermediate nodes. Consider the\ntrade-offs and make an informed decision.\n\nMany times on this list it was said that this is all fine, but that you\nsimply can&#39;t call it REST if you don&#39;t use standardized types. Firstly,\nI&#39;m not convinced of that (but surely, someone can provide the proper\nquote from Roy&#39;s thesis to support their point). Secondly, if that&#39;s the\ncase then I&#39;m happy to start calling it &#39;semi-REST&#39;, so that we can move\non to talk about the technical benefits of REST constraints, including\nthis one, without getting side-tracked by this somewhat unnecessary\nfight over nomenclature.\n\nJuergen\n\n\n-- \nJuergen Brendel\nMuleSoft\n\n\n"}}
