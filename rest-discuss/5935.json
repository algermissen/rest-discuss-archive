That is, \n&gt; requests from the server to the client?  I guess the \n&gt; appropriate way is to have the &quot;server&quot; make HTTP requests of \n&gt; the &quot;client&quot;.  But that can&#39;t be done if the client is behind \n&gt; a firewall.\nThat isn&#39;t a violation at all. Just reverse the roles of the machines. The\nfirewall is there for a reason and whatever approach you use probably\nshouldn&#39;t bypass those reasons.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Basically, my intention is to piggyback the reverse request \n&gt; in a response to a request from the client.  Then the client \n&gt; would respond by sending a new request to the server, and so \n&gt; forth.  The resource URL for the reverse request would now \n&gt; have to be encoded in the body of the HTTP response.\n&gt; \nThere have been many approaches to this. One is to model the requests as\nmessages in a queue hosted by the server, and GET those messages (then later\nrespond to them). Personally, I don&#39;t think this is very RESTful, but\nwhatever.\nI&#39;ve actually implemented this sort of thing and have also done an addition\nbit - have the server /not/ respond right away if there are no existing\nmessages, just hold onto the connection. When a new message arrives, then\nsend the response. This gives a low-latency way to send data to the browser.\nI also have a simple javascript library that supports registering callbacks,\nessentially providing asynchronous events to the browser. \nI&#39;d love to give you a pointer, but the servlet seems to be inaccesible\nright now. But it&#39;s cool. Really.\n\n\n\n"}}
