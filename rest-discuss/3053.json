I&#39;m a newcomer to REST and I just discovered this list, \nplease pardon me if I&#39;m naive.\n\nThe documents I exchange with the REST interface are mainly server \nconfiguration, status and statistics, for multiple profiles.\n\nA first issue is handling the collection of profiles, similar to how a \nREST style blogger interface would handle a collection of posts:\n\nhttp://internet.conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/RestifyingBlogger\n\nPOSTing to the container might be a solution, which I first read in \nPhilip Eskelin&#39;s mail:\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/2974\n\nThis seems to be kind of bending the semantics of POST -- sort of \nassuming that the path is just a selector in a super document -- but \nworks well as an alternative to having to GET the latest profile \nidentifier and to PUT to the next profile ID (handling race conditions, \noverwriting existing profiles, etc).\n\nBrowsing around for inspiration, I stepped into Mark Baker&#39;s article on \nPUT vs. SET:\n\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca/blog/2002/12/13#2002-12-soap-put\n\nIf I get this right, if PUTting a document has side effects, then PUT \nisn&#39;t the right method to use, you should be using a (to be proposed) \nSET method.\n\nI&#39;m currently updating profile cofniguration and status via PUT, would \nthe use of SET be more appropriate? (the clients to this interface \nprobably wouldn&#39;t be browsers)\n\nI view POST as &quot;PUT but in append&quot;, so for the creation of new profiles \nwould there be a need for a &quot;SET but in append&quot; method?\n\nThanks,\nDuncan\n\n--\nhttp://duncan.focuseek.com\n\n\n\n"}}
