Is there an existing content-type that describes\n&gt;&gt; it?  If not, you need to define one so that, at least nominally.\n&gt;\n&gt; The resource is a message, that can be represented by various\n&gt; content-types, an thus the server can accept any of them, and return any\n&gt; of them...\n\nThe question is &quot;to what sort of resource is your message a subordinate?&quot;\n\n&gt; http rfc2616 state that a file is subordinate to a directory ... in the\n&gt; POST section!! How can you say that a directory is not postable ??\n\nPOST implies that there is an obvious meaning to a request for an entity to \nbecome a subordinate.  I am not sure how you POST to a directory because \ndirectory semantics usually require a file name to get stuff put in the \ndirectory.\n\nIf you are defining a directory-style resource that accepts POST and \nassigned random directory names, that&#39;s fine, but then, again, you need to \ncommunicate that in the content-type!\n\nWhy do you oppose requiring the user to ask for an index if the use wants \nan index?\n\n\n&gt; if my uri is http://host/messages?mid=132346132 , it&#39;s not\n&gt; hierarchical... but the message is still subordinate to the box. (se\n&gt; quote above), as long as a ref to that URI is present in the result of\n&gt; the GET on the box uri (a external content in the header of a\n&gt; mime/rfc822 in an message/digest if you want).\n\nWhat is the URI of your box and when you do a raw GET, does the server \nreturn &quot;whatever information&quot; is referenced by the URI?  Does that \ninformation include the fact that it is meaningful for a message to be \nsubordinate to your resource?\nIf I receive an index in response to a raw GET, how do I know whether I am \nsupposed to POST notifications (a la RNA) or messages (as you seem to want)?\nDoes an index-type communicate that the resource is POSTable?  Directory \nindexes communicate only that the resource is a container.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
