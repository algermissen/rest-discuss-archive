So far I\n&gt; have looked into using ASP.NET pages\n&gt; (http://www.intertw=\r\ningly.net/wiki/pie/RestAspNetExample and\n&gt; http://www.prescod.net/rest/dotn=\r\net/) and URL rewritting\n&gt; (http://www.codeproject.com/aspnet/URLRewriter.as=\r\np) or taking over the\n&gt; entire system using an HTTP handler or module.  I&#39;m=\r\n really unsure as\n&gt; to what direction to take.\n\nTha answer is to use the IH=\r\nttpHandler interface (you will need to\nconfigure IIS to wildcard match to t=\r\nhe aspnet runtime in order to\nreceive directory requests - otherwise you wi=\r\nll have to put up with\nugly extension mappings). The beauty of this approac=\r\nh is that you\ndon&#39;t need to fritz around with URLRewrites at all (the downs=\r\nide is\nthat IIS will route *all* requests on that path - including jpg, gif=\r\n,\netc). In the HttpHandler you have direct access to the HTTP pipeline\nso y=\r\nou can check the HTTP Method used (HEAD, GET, PUT, POST, DELETE).\nFrom that=\r\n point on, it is relatively straightforward to implement\nRESTful behaviour.=\r\n\n\n&gt; Does anyone have any suggestions or want\n&gt; to tell me that using IIS an=\r\nd/or .NET for REST doesn&#39;t make sense?\n\nOn the contrary - it makes absolute=\r\n sense - &quot;Death to WebForms!&quot; I\nsay... (the evil child of .NET)\n\n&gt; I like t=\r\nhe idea of using GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE because the action\n&gt; being perf=\r\normed is obvious.  One article I found (on this very list)\n&gt; suggests using=\r\n GET and POST makes more sense for untrusted (browser)\n&gt; clients.  If this =\r\nis the case, then how does one define in a POST that\n&gt; it is actually a DEL=\r\nETE or PUT?  I&#39;m also curious to know if any\n&gt; XMLHttpRequest implementatio=\r\nns even support PUT and DELETE.\n\nDon Box has caused some discussion around =\r\nthis in the .NET community\nrecently with postulating that there is a &quot;Lo-Re=\r\nst&quot; and a &quot;Hi-Rest&quot;\nstyle (see\nhttp://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/20=\r\n06/03/18/20235.aspx)\n\n&gt; If you haven&#39;t already guessed, I&#39;m not very well v=\r\nersed in the HTTP\n&gt; realm.  Are there any good HTTP resources out there for=\r\n someone like me?\n\nStep 1: Get familiar with the W3C docs, especially:\n\n&quot;HT=\r\nTP/1.1: Method Definitions&quot;\nhttp://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec=\r\n9.html\n\n&quot;HTTP/1.1: Header Field Definitions&quot;\nhttp://www.w3.org/Protocols/rf=\r\nc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.1\n\n&quot;HTTP/1.1: Status Code Definitions&quot;\nhttp:=\r\n//www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html\n\n&quot;HTTP/1.1: Request&quot;\nhttp=\r\n://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec5.html#sec5\n\n&quot;HTTP/1.1: Response=\r\n&quot;\nhttp://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec6.html#sec6\n\nStep 2: Feel =\r\nfree to wander around my REST category in delicious:\nhttp://del.icio.us/ala=\r\nn.dean/rest\n\nHope that helps :-)\n\nAlan Dean\nLead Developer, OnlineTravel.co=\r\nm\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
