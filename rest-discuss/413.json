This message\n&gt; &gt; server can be secured as much as lucas wants.\n&gt; &gt; (Or we can reuse the existing mail server).\n&gt;\n&gt; As usual, I don&#39;t see what SMTP brings to the table. It doesn&#39;t satisfy\n&gt; Lucas&#39; extreme requirements and it doesn&#39;t simplify anything.\n\nPeople already maintain secured mail servers.\nMail gets past the firewall.\nMail looks a lot like Lucas&#39; protocol.\n\n&gt; &gt; ...\n&gt; &gt; If the app lives on a client behind the firewall,\n&gt; &gt; then it maintains either a persistent GET or a POP\n&gt; &gt; connection to the mailserver and recieves messages\n&gt; &gt; when they arrive.\n&gt;\n&gt; What does POP supply that HTTP wouldn&#39;t? Just a gateway to legacy\n&gt; clients?\n\nAs I said, I like the persistent GET better than\nPOP (lower latency and no-polling).  I am just\nmaking an architectural observation.\n\n\n-Alex-\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
