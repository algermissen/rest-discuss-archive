The server can check\nfor the &quot;delete-reason&quot; and, if not found, throw a 400  (possibly\n424-failed dependency).\n\nThe downside is that it takes two steps. However, it does restore\nproper support for the DELETE method.\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Sep 29, 2008 at 13:37, Subbu Allamaraju &lt;subbu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; More broadly speaking, such a sidekick could be used for a number of other\n&gt; use cases where the HTTP&#39;s uniform interface is inadequate.\n&gt;\n&gt; In this particular use case, using a sidekick resource to delete a resource\n&gt; as suggested by Mike has some limitations worth noting:\n&gt;\n&gt; a.
