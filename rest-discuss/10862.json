The application state is in the client.\nIt&#39;s not the same thing as =\r\nthe resource state on the server (which is\nhow I interpreted your descripti=\r\non). The simplest way to think about\nit is as a web of connected resources =\r\nbeing a state machine. The\nclient navigates the state machine by executing =\r\nGETs -- the current\nstate of the application is determined by the resource =\r\nrepresentation\nit is currently &quot;viewing&quot; (it&#39;s actually defined by multiple=\r\n resource\nrepresentations at one time, such as images and scripts linked fr=\r\nom an\nHTML doc, but let&#39;s ignore that complexity for now). The hyperlinks i=\r\nn\nthe representation are the possible transitions through the state machine=\r\n.\n\nBut the state machine has more to it -- the client can change the\nstate =\r\nmachine as well as navigate it. A POST allows a client to add a\nstate (and =\r\nusually navigate to that new state in one step). A PUT\nallows a client to c=\r\nhange a state and a DELETE lets it remove a state.\nThe changes that a clien=\r\nt can make at any time are also governed by\nthe representation that it is c=\r\nurrently viewing. This is usually done\nthrough forms embedded in the repres=\r\nentation.\n\nAt least that&#39;s my take on it...\n\nAndrew Wahbe\n\n--- In rest-disc=\r\nuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;mike amundsen&quot; &lt;mamund@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve posted a =\r\nshort article (@1000 words) on REST that encapsulates my\n&gt; own understandin=\r\ng of the style.
