Data design is usually easier, or at least\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt; more obvious.\n&gt;  &gt; There is no difference b/w the two: both documents and data\n&gt;  &gt; structures are designed to fit a problem space. You might prefer one\n&gt;  &gt; approach over another, because you are more comfortable with it, but\n&gt;  &gt; that&#39;s a personal matter and not a technical issue.\n&gt;\n&gt;  compare / contrast:\n&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;book&gt;\n&gt;       &lt;title&gt;Read this book&lt;/title&gt;\n&gt;       &lt;quantity&gt;1&lt;/quantity&gt;\n&gt;       &lt;author&gt;Bob the Dog&lt;/author&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;/book&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  {\n&gt;       &quot;title&quot; : &quot;Read this book&quot;,\n&gt;       &quot;quantity&quot; : 1,\n&gt;       &quot;author&quot; : [\n&gt;           &quot;Bob the Dog&quot;\n&gt;       ]\n&gt;  }\n&gt;\n&gt;  Note the embedded data is more self-descriptive than the XML; I can tell\n&gt;  just from looking at the title value, that it&#39;s a string; that the\n&gt;  quantity is a number, and that the author is a list (multi-valued), with\n&gt;  one string element.  None of which you could infer from the XML.\n\nAs was said, you&#39;re putting your preferences in front of fact.\n\nA schema aware XML could provide the data types, far more so than json.\nAs for self descriptive?
