According to [1] (section 3.3), the &#39;@&#39; character is\n&gt; &gt; legal in the URI path and does not require escaping.\n&gt; &gt; [1] http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt \n&gt; I didn&#39;t check rfc 2396, but rfc 3986 obsoletes it. Reading from\n&gt; &quot;Reserved\n&gt; Characters&quot; section[1] it appears that you should percent encode the\n&gt; &#39;@&#39;\n&gt; character, but I could be misreading. Can anyone on the list with more\n&gt; experience tell me if I&#39;m interpreting it incorrectly, and if so why?\n\n&quot;@&quot; is legal in most parts of a uri, since it is part of the pchar set.\n\nAs for the RESTfulness or not of dream, I suppose I have some comments.\nI am reading\n&lt;http://doc.opengarden.org/Articles/REST_for_the_Rest_of_Us&gt;.\n\nMy initial reactions:\n* In REST it is likely that multiple resources will be served from a\nsingle defined set of state, ie a service. For example an object or a\nset of objects are likely to have several resources associated with them\nthat act as the network interface to these objects. I would suggest that\ninstead of &quot;Each Dream service (being) a resource&quot;, each dream service\nshould make a set of resources available. \n* Returning a dream blueprint to users of the system doesn&#39;t read to me\nas useful. If the blueprint exposure is an internal deployment\nmechanism, this is ok. The blueprint appears to be an internal document\nthat allows particular methods on particular resources to be mapped to\nother method invocations on internally-defined objects. This is fine,\nbut should not normally be communicated to users of the interface. Users\nshould see published lists of URIs that meet particular requirements the\nuses may have. Perhaps a cut-down form of the blueprint would be more\nappropriate than one that exposes internal classes and the like.\n* It looks like access to HTML headers and the like may be limited.\nWhere is the url returned in a POST&#39;s Location header in\n&lt;http://doc.opengarden.org/Dream_SDK/Tutorials/Address_Book&gt;?\n\nOn the whole the framework doesn&#39;t look particularly RESTful or\nnon-RESTful. It would be up to a particular blueprint and implementation\nto conform or not conform to REST principles. If it is designed for\ninteraction with HTTP and allows appropriate access to HTTP headers I\ndon&#39;t see any obvious problems on the surface.\n\nBenjamin\n\n\n"}}
