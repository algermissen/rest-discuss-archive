In response to criticism \n&gt; [3], I am looking for constructive suggestions as to how to make this \n&gt; interface more compatible with REST.\n\nWhile I don&#39;t really have any suggestions, I would like to throw in a\nthought from here - I *think* I would like to be able to tell whether\nthe data that I threw at the validator was valid RSS or not by looking\nat the status code. This requires a slight rethink of the model Sam has,\nwhereby the URI represents a container that you&#39;re *supposed* to throw\nvalid RSS at, and receive either:\n\na 200 status with no message body if the RSS is valid\n\nor\n\na non-200 status back (with the details in the message body) if it&#39;s not. \n\nThing is, I can&#39;t figure out what the status code should be. I first\nlooked at status code 415 (Unsupported Media Type) but I suspect that\nwould mean that &#39;application/rss+xml&#39; was *generally* not supported at\nthat URI, rather than just *invalid* &#39;application/rss+xml&#39;. \n\nSo - is trying to get away from the &#39;homogenisation&#39; of all results into\na 200 status code an appropriate thing to do here (or anywhere)? \n\nThanks for any comments\ndj\n\np.s. If I didn&#39;t know Sam better I would suspect this conundrum is \ndeliberate ;) Either that, or my brane is too addled from festive food.\n\n"}}
