The goal is to allow all of our\ncustomers t=\r\no access our api so they can get information regarding\ntheir account/transa=\r\nctions. \n\nCreating the resources seem fairly straight forward. For example,=\r\n each\ncustomer can access a list of their transactions via a URL such as: \n=\r\nhttp://webapi.ourdomain.com/customer/123/transactions\n\nThe question I have =\r\nis how to I secure the application such that\ncustomer 123 only has access t=\r\no /customer/123/* ??\n\nI am developing the application using the RESTEasy fr=\r\namework running\nin Tomcat. I am familiar with basic servlet authentication.=\r\n However,\nwe are likely to have more and more customers and do not want to\n=\r\nmodify the web.xml and redeploy for every new customer. \n\nIs there an appro=\r\nach to configuring multiple client authentication\nwithout having to redeplo=\r\ny each time? \n\nThanks,\nJeff\n\n\n"}}
