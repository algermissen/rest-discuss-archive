This ambition has come to be known as \n&gt; &#39;orchestration&#39; or &#39;choreography&#39;: the analogy with the way in which skilled \n&gt; musicians and dancers co-ordinate their actions while carrying out \n&gt; predetermined instructions is entirely deliberate. The possibilities are \n&gt; entrancing... but at this very moment new difficulties appear.&quot;\n\nThe idea that programmers won&#39;t be involved spawns the idea that\nprogramming won&#39;t be involved and that&#39;s obvious nonsense.\n\nBut clearly there is scope, given our discoverable world, for a webapp\nto build process based webapps. Personally, I think that&#39;s much more\nlikely with REST based services than it is with WS-*.\n\nOr perhaps I should say that I believe a reliable system that doesn&#39;t\ncost the earth to fix when it does fail, is more likely with REST than\nwith WS-*.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
