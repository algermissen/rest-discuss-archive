Fielding wrote:\n&gt; Don&#39;t read too much into what is obviously a poor choice of words.\n&gt; What they meant to say is that some services correspond to a range\n&gt; (template) of URIs for which guessing the potential values in that\n&gt; range is a perfectly reasonable thing to do, even if there turns\n&gt; out to be no resource for a given guess. There are no guarantees\n&gt; on the Web.\n\nIf you have a hypermedia application client/agent that interprets the\nresources it receives and then uses that resource as the basis for\ndetermining the available state transitions supported by the server, why\nwould you need to bother with guessing (or relying on a URI template)\nfor an automated agent?\n\nMaybe I&#39;m wrong, but I see URI templates as a pragmatic shortcut so that\nagent authors don&#39;t need to bother with interpreting the hypermedia they\nreceive.  This makes writing agents more in line with standard modes of\nthinking about software design and implementation, e.g. to accomplish a\ntask, you make calls to functions with known parameters in an order\ndetermined by the caller to trigger state transitions and/or receive\nsome expected output.\n\nHowever, if that&#39;s the way you approach development of a hypermedia\napplication where the service has the opportunity - by design - to tell\nyou about the available state transitions and the location of other\nresources that it thinks are related/relevant to the current resource,\nhow is your agent really part of a hypermedia application?\n\nAs Nick pointed out, there aren&#39;t many systems out there that do this\n(interactive Web browsers being a notable exception).  I think this is\none of the drivers for the sem-web initiatives, but I also think there&#39;s\nvalue in trying to leverage this approach today to build more robust\nsoftware systems that can gracefully handle changes in the service\nimplementation.\n\nast\n-- \nAndrew S.
