The only difference is \n&gt; that\n&gt; in 2) the server can unilaterally enforce the scheme.\n\nThe 2) would have to be a POST, as the PUT request contains the URI of the \nresource. A PUT request means &quot;make the resource &#39;uri123xyz&#39; look like this \ncontent&quot; - the client has to already know the URI.\n\n\n"}}
