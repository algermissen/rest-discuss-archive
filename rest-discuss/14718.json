Roy confirmed that (recent post on atom-protocol list)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Really? Can you link to that? Was it the &quot;MUST a collection be returned as an Atom feed?&quot; thread?\n\nYep. http://www.imc.org/atom-protocol/mail-archive/msg11487.html\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I didn&#39;t read any of Roy&#39;s comments that way... or maybe I don&#39;t understand what you mean by &quot;AtomPub&#39;s predefined flow&quot;.\n\nThe requirement that a GET on a collection returns an Atom feed. That is unRESTful coupling because the client must not rely on such information but react to whatever it gets at runtime.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Do you mean the Service -&gt; Feed -&gt; Entry hierarchy?\n\nYes, that&#39;s what it comes down to.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; You said yourself in that thread that &lt;collection&gt; and &lt;image&gt; played conceptually similar roles. Isn&#39;t Page -&gt; Image a similar two-level hierarchy? What is wrong with that?\n\n&lt;collection href=&quot;&quot;&gt; points to &#39;a collection&#39;, that is ok. But predefining the media type that comes back from the collection is not. Might well be RSS or text/uri-list\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I guess what I&#39;m wondering is if AtomPub really defines an \n&gt; &quot;application flow&quot; or do client writers mistake the hierarchy for one?\n\nA truly RESTful client would do a GET on the collection and treat any response as &#39;correct&#39; from a server POV (except for non-Collection representations, for\nexample an audio file).\n\nOnly if we do that the server&#39;s independent evolvability is preserved.\n\nJan\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Andrew\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
