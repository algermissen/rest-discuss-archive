I simply cannot see how you can get from one\nsituation (of using RESTful application state on the client and\nhypermedia to determine all state transitions) to the next\nsituation of needing distributed agreement of transaction semantics\nwherein the client has to tell the server how to manage its own\nresources.\n\nMost likely, the system you are thinking of is just doing\nCRUD operations on multiple servers.  Each of those actions\nmight be based on a RESTful architecture.  When all of them\nare done and the client makes a final request to approve or\ncancel the changes, it might be interacting with a TM-style\nmanager resource that tells all of the other services to commit\nthe associated changes to a more persistent or public set of\nresources, just like a staging server might be used to prepare\ncontent prior to publication.   The sum of all those actions\nmight be equivalent to an ACID transaction.\n\nNone of that matters to the REST client.  As far as the client is\nconcerned, it is only interacting with one resource at a time\neven when those interactions overlap asynchronously. There is\nno &quot;transaction protocol&quot; aside from whatever agreement mechanism\nis implemented in the back-end in accordance with the resource\nsemantics (in a separate architecture that we don&#39;t care about\nhere).  There is no commit protocol other than the presentation\nof various options to the client at any given point in the\napplication.  There is no need for client-side agreement with\nthe transaction protocol because the client is only capable of\nchoosing from the choices provided by the server.\n\nIf I am missing something, please let me know, but for now\nI consider &quot;rest transaction&quot; to be an oxymoron.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
