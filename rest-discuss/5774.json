It would be appropriate if for example the \nresponse was also going to be application/xml+rdf, the request was \ncorrect, but the request said that only text/html was an acceptable \nresponse.\n\nI&#39;d reserve 409 for a case where the request was valid, but not \nappropriate in this particular case.\n\nOtherwise I&#39;d go for 400.\n\n"}}
