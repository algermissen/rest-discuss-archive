The same occurs for\nthe response.\n\nThis approach insures that the client and server will\noperate in a RESTful yet more decoupled manner.\n\nRoger Costello &lt;costello@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I would like to create a REST resource which serves\n&gt; up XML and receives XML. For those clients at a \n&gt; browser the XML will be styled into HTML\n&gt; via an XSLT stylesheet.  Suppose that this\n&gt; styling results in an HTML form that the user fills\n&gt; in to create a Purchase Order.\n[snip]\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
