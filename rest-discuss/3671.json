You say that they\n&gt; cannot share a common URI, but appear to list that as option #1.\n\nHmm.. yeah.  That is confusing.  Sorry.  What I meant was that potentially\neach person accessing the resource must be individually identifiable. Which\nis a better format:\n\nhttp://user:pwd@domain/path\nhttp://domain/path/nonce\n\n&gt; It&#39;s  also unclear whether you just want user-agent caching or shared\n&gt; caching (e.g., in proxies); I&#39;ll assume the latter.\n\nYou are correct.\n\n&gt; If that&#39;s the case, I&#39;d recommend option #1 with\n&gt;    Cache-Control: public, must-revalidate, max-age=0\n&gt; This allows a cache to keep a copy of the representation, but forces it\n&gt; to validate each request on the origin server, thereby maintaining\n&gt; access control. (BTW, I would not recommend using no-cache, as some\n&gt; implementations may still incorrectly interpret this as having the\n&gt; semantics of no-store).\n\nAha!  This was the answer I was looking for.  I suspected this was the\nbetter approach, but I did not know the Cache-Control details.\n\n&gt; A more efficient approach would be to cache the authentication state on\n&gt; intermediaries, rather than just the representations; this would allow\n&gt; them to avoid the round-trip back to the origin server every time. I\n&gt; wrote up an Internet-Draft [1] about this a while back, but the major\n&gt; drawback is that it won&#39;t work with Digest authentication. I don&#39;t know\n&gt; of any implementations.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hope this helps,\n&gt;\n&gt; 1.  http://www.mnot.net/papers/draft-nottingham-http-auth-cache-00.txt\n\nThanks!  I&#39;ll take a look.\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
