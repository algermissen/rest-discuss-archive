Hence the need for at least a SHOULD on the\n&gt; &gt; Location header.\n&gt;\n&gt; Agreed. I was trying to lower the bar for minimal implementations. I\n&gt; think that Mike&#39;s idea of an unsub URI might not be a terrible fallback\n&gt; for if software doesn&#39;t support DELETE.\n&gt;\nIt&#39;s not really my idea - just pointing out a common way its done in todays\nworld.\n\n\n\n"}}
