But they are probably overkill. I would just\n&gt; use an attribute with an &quot;href&quot;. \n&gt; \nI&#39;ll have a look at those then, thanks.\n\n&gt; &gt; If I used query parameters and hyperlinks, would that make\n&gt; &gt; sense, or should I go back to slashes then?  For example:\n[...]\n&gt; \n&gt; It all boils down to whether you expect the client to want to \n&gt; construct those URIs. If it will always use the XML files for \n&gt; navigation then you have complete freedom and would probably\n&gt; use the slashes.  If the client is going to want to sometimes\n&gt; do navigation without going through the XML files then you\n&gt; should use query params.\n&gt; \nQuery parameters it is then.  Is there a verdict about whether\nboth types are allow, but the client can only use slashes when\nfollowing hyperlinks, otherwise query parameters?\n\n&gt; &gt; ... To create user1, I might do\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; POST /visp/users?v=xyz\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;?&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE viml SYSTEM &quot;viml.dtd&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;viml&gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &lt;user username=&quot;user1/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;/viml&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Right!\n&gt; \nSay I create a website at the same time.  In the response,\nwould it be OK for the domain attribute to be there as well\nas the href?\n\n...\n   &lt;user username=&quot;user1&quot;&gt;\n     &lt;website domain=&quot;www.customer.com&quot;\n              href=&quot;/visp/website?v=xyz&u=user1&d=www.customer.com&quot;/&gt;\n   &lt;/user&gt;\n...\n\nPerhaps not make it a website element, but a generic link:\n\n...\n   &lt;user username=&quot;user1&quot;&gt;\n     &lt;child href=&quot;/visp/website?v=xyz&u=user1&d=www.customer.com&quot;/&gt;\n   &lt;/user&gt;\n...\n\n&lt;thinking-out-loud&gt;\nOh no, then I&#39;m going to have to define a separate doctype for\neach of my services.  Unless I add a type attribute.\n&lt;/thinking-out-loud&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; Well, in a sense my clients own the namespace, in that they\n&gt; &gt; choose the usernames, domains, etc.  Or am I getting my\n&gt; &gt; terminology wrong now?\n&gt; \n&gt; I would say that your clients own their names and those\n&gt; names are combined by the server into the URI namespace.\n&gt; In a content management situation it is only the human\n&gt; being doing the publishing who knows why they put it in\n&gt; /financial instead of /development. \n&gt; \nAgreed.  The client owns some of the names, but I (the domain\nname owner) am still saying how and where they can be used.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Problems I have with my own design:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  - If I were a client I would expect to be able to send a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    whole profile and have everything provisioned at once.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    This is not insurmountable, just more effort (and some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    thinking about transactional guarantees, if any).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; POST can handle that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not sure how changing to a POST solves this one.  Perhaps\n&gt; &gt; I should break the hierarchy out of the DTD and define everything\n&gt; &gt; at the top level.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry, I meant to say that a POST could actually create more than one\n&gt; resource. I don&#39;t think it violates HTTP semantics to have it \n&gt; do so. We could probably argue about that though.\n&gt; \n&gt; This issue of batch data sending has arisen before...there are three\n&gt; reasons to want it: 1. client convenience, 2. reducing network latency\n&gt; and 3. atomicity.\n&gt; \nYes, but 1 and 3 mean more work for me.  But possibly not\nas much as I first thought -- if I do the design right.\n\n&gt; &gt;...\n&gt; &gt; I think this is what I was missing, I was thinking at\n&gt; &gt; the wrong level of identification because I had specific\n&gt; &gt; ideas about how POST and PUT should be used.  I saw\n&gt; &gt; adding a service as requiring a 201 (Created) response,\n&gt; &gt; which I would get from a PUT.\n&gt; \n&gt; Note that POST can generate a Created response too. \n&gt; \nYes, I saw that too late.  I&#39;m now thinking in a sort of\ndirectory and file (or SQL INSERT and UPDATE) analogy and\nthat&#39;s helped me get out of my PUT = create mindset.\n\nThanks very much for your comments, I very much feel like I&#39;m\ngetting somewhere!\n\nRegards,\n  Andrew\n\n"}}
