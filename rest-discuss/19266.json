The common\nway to achieve this is to use a URL for the rel value and expose a\ndescription document there.\n\nThis works for any kind of interaction (other than hitting entry points)\nand is why there is, usually, no need for an API to use any custom media\ntypes at all.\n\nCheers,\nM\n\r\n--047d7b3a7fb4aebe0704d56e12a2\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;p dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nOn 11 Feb 2013 05:05, &quot;Jan Algermissen&quot; &lt;&lt;=\r\na href=3D&quot;mailto:jan.algermissen@...&quot;&gt;jan.algermissen@...&lt;/a&gt;=\r\n&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =A0&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Hi,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; t=\r\nrying to wrap my head around the implications of using generic patch media =\r\ntypes (e.g. json-patch[1]) vs. specific ones, e.g. application/vnd.bigco.cu=\r\nstomer-patch.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Generic JSON patch looks sort of fine, but =\r\nI can make myself stop feeling it&#39;s tunneling out of band knowledge.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; When the client constructs the patch document, it makes ass=\r\numptions about the (abstract) structure of the target resource that is esse=\r\nntially out of band knowledge.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; You might argue, that the =\r\nclient will have learnt the structure from a previous GET...&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; GET /customers/42&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Accept: application/vnd.bigco.customer+json&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 200 Ok&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Content-Type: application/vnd.bigco.custo=\r\nmer+json&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ETag: &quot;...&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ... and that unde=\r\nrstanding the *specific* media type (and having an ETag) acts as a counter =\r\nmeasure for the patch format being generic.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Alas ...
