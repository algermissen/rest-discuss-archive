For quite sometime I thought that WebServices\n&gt;should be more URI based, so I was glad to find that\n&gt;there is the whole theory behind that :). While I am\n&gt;trying to catch up with the REST literature I have a\n&gt;question of a more practicle  nature. I am wondering\n&gt;if there is an outgoing Open Source effort(s) which\n&gt;have a goal to build a web services infrustucture\n&gt;around REST principles.\n\nNot as such, at least as far as I am aware, but there are webapp\ninfrastructures that are better or worse suited for REST development. For\nexample, Apache Jakarta Struts, while being a very popular and robust MVC\ninfrastructure, is completely ill-suited for REST since the URL and actual\ncontents of a resource may have no relation to one another (struts overuses\nthe servlet RequestDispatcher API). Apache Cocoon, for another example, is\nreasonably useful for REST - it uses a sitemap to map urls to pipelines of\nprocessing components. On the other hand, it&#39;s aimed more at web sites than\nwebapps, thus may not be suitable as a &quot;web services&quot; infrastructure.\n\nWhat other webapp infrastructures have people used for REST projects that\nturned out well or poorly?\n\n- donald\n\n\n"}}
