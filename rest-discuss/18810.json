Maybe that is out of band knowledge, but then again, knowing w=\r\nhat @method=3D&quot;POST&quot; means\ncould be considered out of band too.   It has to=\r\n be written down somewhere and agreed to.  So the sharing of the semantics\n=\r\nwidely is key to interoperability.  Hence a public link relations registry.=\r\n   It is the shared semantics that allows us to\nprogram user agents to do p=\r\nredictable things when they come across a particular hypermedia construct.\n=\r\n\nMaybe it is important that when a GET is done on a resource, that the resp=\r\nonse metadata also declare the available methods.\nMessage metadata is autho=\r\nritative.\n\nBut you should not have to do that GET, because it is a waste of=\r\n bandwidth, and the representation format has already\ndefined (in the regis=\r\ntry) and declared (in the instance in which you find the href) the (possibl=\r\ny implicit) method availabilities.\n\n&gt; 3. It is important to understand that=\r\n the rel is the relation the resource identified by the link&#39;s URI, has wit=\r\nh the actual resource/uri/document. It is not good if you use rel to denote=\r\n other information, like saying rel=3D&quot;CreateWithPost&quot; to hint the agent to=\r\n use the link&#39;s URI with a POST to create something. That is not the intend=\r\ned use and it is a bad practice.\nIt seems reasonable to me, I don&#39;t see why=\r\n it is a bad practice.  It looks a lot like the atom:link@rel=3D&quot;edit&quot;, or =\r\nhtml&#39;s @method=3D&quot;POST&quot;.\n\nCheers,\nPeter\n\n\n________________________________\n=\r\nFrom: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com [mailto:rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com] On=\r\n Behalf Of paul_k_moore\nSent: May 3, 2012 11:00\nTo: rest-discuss@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com\nSubject: [rest-discuss] Re: Rel attributes?\n\n\n\n\nWilliam\n\nThis is very=\r\n useful - thank you.\n\nJust to confirm my (refined) understanding here, I co=\r\nnsider the meaning of &#39;rel&#39; to be an orthogonal concern to the HTTP methods=\r\n.\n\nTo expound slightly, I had erroneously conflated the HTTP methods (avaia=\r\nlble at the target URI) into the meaning of &#39;rel&#39;. If we consider the follo=\r\nwing two examples:\n\nExample 1: Use of a &#39;rel&#39; such as &#39;http://relations.exa=\r\nmple.com/order&#39; reasonably conveys to the user-agent that there is somethin=\r\ng &#39;order&#39;-like at the target URI. It is then up to the client (the client i=\r\nntent) to follow this rel (using an implicit GET request) to retrieve the r=\r\nepresentation of the &#39;order&#39;-like thing (as rendered in a specific media-ty=\r\npe).\n\nExample 2: Use of a &#39;rel&#39; such as &#39;http://relations.example.com/new&#39; =\r\nto (unreasonably) convey that the user agent can POST an item of the type c=\r\nommunicated by it&#39;s current context. This is the problem, I don&#39;t need to &#39;=\r\nsay&#39; to the user-agent that it can POST at a specific URI, because the avai=\r\nlable HTTP methods tell me what I can do with the resource. What I need to =\r\ndo is examine the permitted methods (either by inspection of the &#39;Allow&#39; he=\r\nader, or an OPTIONS request) AND not try to convey the permutations of meth=\r\nod in the &#39;rel&#39;.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nThanks in advance\n\nPaul\n\n--- In re=\r\nst-discuss@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:rest-discuss%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;William=\r\n Martinez Pomares&quot; &lt;wmartinez@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi nikonguy74!\n&gt; Just to comp=\r\nlement what Jan is saying:\n&gt; 1. Links represent resources you can work with=\r\n. The idea of links is that you can usually follow them (issuing a GET oper=\r\nation), but then there are lots of questions you may have about them: what =\r\ndo I do with the actual resource (say, web page) I&#39;m in? What is this link =\r\nreferring to? What other operations apart from GET can I execute with it? C=\r\nan I add query parameters to it? What media type will it return? What media=\r\n type may it expect if I can issue a POST?, etc...\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. rel is an attribu=\r\nte to add more information about a link. I denotes a value, keyword, hint o=\r\nf what relation the link has with the current resource/IRI. Say you are in =\r\na book page, that is your current resources and it has a URI. A link with r=\r\nel=3D&quot;next&quot; will hint that following that link will get you to the next pag=\r\ne of the book.\n&gt;\n&gt; 3. It is important to understand that the rel is the rel=\r\nation the resource identified by the link&#39;s URI, has with the actual resour=\r\nce/uri/document. It is not good if you use rel to denote other information,=\r\n like saying rel=3D&quot;CreateWithPost&quot; to hint the agent to use the link&#39;s URI=\r\n with a POST to create something. That is not the intended use and it is a =\r\nbad practice.\n&gt;\n&gt; 4. You may need actual business intelligence in your clie=\r\nnt. If you are looking at a blog comment, a rel=3D&quot;parent&quot; will tell you th=\r\ne links points to the actual blog post. Having that information, you can st=\r\nart asking that parent for information, or even send a comment to it using =\r\nPOST operation. That is natural simply because much of this interaction is =\r\nalready designed in the specs, and the agent may not need to be statically =\r\nprogrammed, but it will need intelligence.\n&gt;\n&gt; 5. So, you have there standa=\r\nrd metainformation (like how to handle media types, the semantics of POST a=\r\nnd PUT, the semantics or link and rel), etc. Plus, you have business specif=\r\nic semantics (the actual value of the rel may mean something applicable onl=\r\ny to, say, banking applications). With that info you can program intelligen=\r\nt clients.\n&gt;\n&gt; 6. Finally, some other &quot;link&quot; tags like anchor and image are=\r\n special links that have a standard meaning and established processing. If =\r\nyou found an &lt;img&gt; tag you automatically know that link is referring to an =\r\nimage, and if you are in HTML page in a browser, the supposed processing it=\r\n to fetch that image with a GET and display it based on context and additio=\r\nnal attributes. All that is told by the tag name, and everybody in the worl=\r\nd knows it. So, links are difficult to understand at first but once you hav=\r\ne it clear they are simple to use. Only don&#39;t expect the link rel attribute=\r\n will tell you everything.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers\n&gt;\n&gt; William Martinez.\n&gt; --- In rest-d=\r\niscuss@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:rest-discuss%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Jan Algermis=\r\nsen &lt;jan.algermissen@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Mar 19, 2012, at 6:40 PM, niko=\r\nnguy74 wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I know one of the first questions i had was on re=\r\nl link. I understand the basic premise behind rel attributes(to provide a g=\r\neneral documentation for how to interact with the link provider).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; T=\r\nhe premise of the rel attribute on links is (in the case of the HTML or Ato=\r\nm media types) to provide information about the meaning of the link beyond =\r\n&#39;this is a link&#39;. If you register your rel name in the IANA registry, you c=\r\nan use the short name you registered, e.g. &#39;next&#39; or &#39;up&#39;. If you did not r=\r\negister your rel, you need to provide a URI. Simply for the matter of makin=\r\ng your rel unambiguous.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If that URI points to a human readable page=\r\n explaining the relation, then that is even better.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There is no mag=\r\nic (not even in REST :-) that removes the need to implement in code (or con=\r\nfigure) what the user agent should do when it sees your link rel value.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;link rel=3D&quot;http://foo/customerDetails&quot; ... /&gt; is conceptually the sa=\r\nme as &lt;link rel=3D&quot;working-copy&quot; .../&gt; and also as HTML&#39;s &lt;img src=3D&quot;...&quot;/=\r\n&gt; or AtomPub&#39;s &lt;collection href=3D&quot;...&quot;/&gt;. It is just hypermedia ... that a=\r\n user agent needs to be programmed to do something with ... in order to hav=\r\ne it do something with it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; IOW, your browser downloads that image b=\r\necause it is programmed to do so. This same concept also applies to other h=\r\nypermedia - your user agent component will act on the hypermedia it comes a=\r\ncross in the way it is programmed (or configured) to do.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; No magic.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The effect of the hypermedia constraint is actually more felt in th=\r\ne obligations you have as a client side programmer (to react to the hyperme=\r\ndia you actually come across instead of the one you presume to come across)=\r\n than it is felt in the aspect of loose coupling.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; REST mostly makes=\r\n explicit that there isn&#39;t any control over the server side in networked sy=\r\nstems. REST encourages you to deal with that rather than magically solves a=\r\n problem that cannot be solved. And on top of that, REST provides a number =\r\nof mechanism that optimize for *dealing with* the problem (e.g. content neg=\r\notiation).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; HTH,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jan\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The question is what would yo=\r\nu see if you go to the rel link?

It is not=\r\n good if you use rel to denote other\n information, like saying rel=3D&quot;=\r\nCreateWithPost&quot; to hint the agent to use the link&#39;s URI with a POST to=\r\n create something.

If we consider the following t=\r\nwo examples:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nExample 1: Use of a &#39;rel&#39; such as &#39;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://=\r\nrelations.example.com/order&quot;&gt;http://relations.example.com/order&lt;/a&gt;&#39; reason=\r\nably conveys to the user-agent that there is something &#39;order&#39;-like at the =\r\ntarget URI. It is then up to the client (the client intent)\n to follow this=\r\n rel (using an implicit GET request) to retrieve the representation of the =\r\n&#39;order&#39;-like thing (as rendered in a specific media-type).&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nExample=\r\n 2: Use of a &#39;rel&#39; such as &#39;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://relations.example.com/new&quot;&gt;ht=\r\ntp://relations.example.com/new&lt;/a&gt;&#39; to (unreasonably) convey that the user =\r\nagent can POST an item of the type communicated by it&#39;s current context. Th=\r\nis is the problem, I don&#39;t\n need to &#39;say&#39; to the user-agent that it can POS=\r\nT at a specific URI, because the available HTTP methods tell me what I can =\r\ndo with the resource. What I need to do is examine the permitted methods (e=\r\nither by inspection of the &#39;Allow&#39; header, or an OPTIONS request)\n AND not =\r\ntry to convey the permutations of method in the &#39;rel&#39;.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nDoes that m=\r\nake sense?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThanks in advance&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nPaul&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n--- In &lt;a href=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:rest-discuss%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;=\r\n, &quot;William Martinez Pomares&quot; &lt;wmartinez@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Hi nikonguy74!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Just to complement what Jan is saying:&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; 1. Links represent resources you can work with. The idea of links i=\r\ns that you can usually follow them (issuing a GET operation), but then ther=\r\ne are lots of questions you may have about them: what do I do with the actu=\r\nal resource (say, web page) I&#39;m in? What\n is this link referring to? What o=\r\nther operations apart from GET can I execute with it? Can I add query param=\r\neters to it? What media type will it return? What media type may it expect =\r\nif I can issue a POST?, etc...&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 2. rel is an attribute to=\r\n add more information about a link. I denotes a value, keyword, hint of wha=\r\nt relation the link has with the current resource/IRI. Say you are in a boo=\r\nk page, that is your current resources and it has a URI. A link with rel=3D=\r\n&quot;next&quot;\n will hint that following that link will get you to the ne=\r\nxt page of the book. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 3. It is important to understand t=\r\nhat the rel is the relation the resource identified by the link&#39;s URI, has =\r\nwith the actual resource/uri/document. It is not good if you use rel to den=\r\note other information, like saying rel=3D&quot;CreateWithPost&quot; to hint=\r\n the agent\n to use the link&#39;s URI with a POST to create something. That is =\r\nnot the intended use and it is a bad practice.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 4. You ma=\r\ny need actual business intelligence in your client. If you are looking at a=\r\n blog comment, a rel=3D&quot;parent&quot; will tell you the links points to=\r\n the actual blog post. Having that information, you can start asking that p=\r\narent for information, or even send\n a comment to it using POST operation. =\r\nThat is natural simply because much of this interaction is already designed=\r\n in the specs, and the agent may not need to be statically programmed, but =\r\nit will need intelligence.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 5. So, you have there standar=\r\nd metainformation (like how to handle media types, the semantics of POST an=\r\nd PUT, the semantics or link and rel), etc. Plus, you have business specifi=\r\nc semantics (the actual value of the rel may mean something applicable only=\r\n\n to, say, banking applications). With that info you can program intelligen=\r\nt clients.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 6. Finally, some other &quot;link&quot; tags =\r\nlike anchor and image are special links that have a standard meaning and es=\r\ntablished processing. If you found an &lt;img&gt; tag you automatically kno=\r\nw that link is referring to an image, and if you are in HTML page in a brow=\r\nser,\n the supposed processing it to fetch that image with a GET and display=\r\n it based on context and additional attributes. All that is told by the tag=\r\n name, and everybody in the world knows it. So, links are difficult to unde=\r\nrstand at first but once you have it\n clear they are simple to use. Only do=\r\nn&#39;t expect the link rel attribute will tell you everything.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; Cheers&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; William Martinez.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; --- In &lt;a href=3D&quot;=\r\nmailto:rest-discuss%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, Ja=\r\nn Algermissen &lt;jan.algermissen@&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Mar 19, 2012, at 6:40 PM, nikonguy74 wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I know one of the first questions i had was on rel=\r\n link.

If you register your rel name in the =\r\nIANA registry, you can use the short name you registered,\n e.g. &#39;next&#39; or &#39;=\r\nup&#39;. If you did not register your rel, you need to provide a URI. Simply fo=\r\nr the matter of making your rel unambiguous.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I=\r\nf that URI points to a human readable page explaining the relation, then th=\r\nat is even better.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; There is no magic (not even=\r\n in REST :-) that removes the need to implement in code (or configure) what=\r\n the user agent should do when it sees your link rel value.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;link rel=3D&quot;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://foo/customerDetails&quot;&gt;h=\r\nttp://foo/customerDetails&lt;/a&gt;&quot; ... /&gt; is conceptually the same as &=\r\nlt;link rel=3D&quot;working-copy&quot; .../&gt; and also as HTML&#39;s &lt;img =\r\nsrc=3D&quot;...&quot;/&gt; or AtomPub&#39;s &lt;collection href=3D&quot;...&quo=\r\nt;/&gt;. It is just hypermedia ... that a\n user agent needs to be programme=\r\nd to do something with ... in order to have it do something with it.&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; IOW, your browser downloads that image because it is=\r\n programmed to do so. This same concept also applies to other hypermedia - =\r\nyour user agent component will act on the hypermedia it comes across in the=\r\n way it is programmed (or configured) to do.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; N=\r\no magic.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The effect of the hypermedia constrai=\r\nnt is actually more felt in the obligations you have as a client side progr=\r\nammer (to react to the hypermedia you actually come across instead of the o=\r\nne you presume to come across) than it is felt in the aspect of loose\n coup=\r\nling.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; REST mostly makes explicit that there is=\r\nn&#39;t any control over the server side in networked systems.
