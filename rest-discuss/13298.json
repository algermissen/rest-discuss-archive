What I liked  \n&gt; about REST was that the interactions can be predefined\n\nYou cannot &#39;predefine&#39; interactions in a RESTful system. You can only  \ndefine link traversal semantics (qua media types or link relations).\n\nThere is no need to (and you must not) standardize anything else.\n\nNote for example, that all client side expectations that constitute  \nthe Atom Publishing Protocol are essentially expressed as link/ \nhypermedia semantics along the lines of &quot;If a client comes across some  \nhypermedia that links to a resource in this and that way it may assume  \nthis and that about the effect that an HTTP method call will have&quot;.\n\nThere is no contract besides link semantics.\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt; and you can snap on media types as needed by specific clients.  Like  \n&gt; HTTP conneg handle the needs of various clients.\n&gt;\n&gt; With a middleware service I&#39;d want to focus on the resource and link  \n&gt; relationship definition.  Define a few example media types where  \n&gt; appropriate but don&#39;t require anything.  This allows implementations  \n&gt; a bit of flexibility to define their own format and use HTTP  \n&gt; conneg.  An example could be the management interface of a  \n&gt; middleware service. Really areas where you&#39;re not gonna get a lot of  \n&gt; agreement on what the representation should be and you really don&#39;t  \n&gt; want something that is the lowest-common-denominator or something  \n&gt; that is bloat.\n&gt;\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Bill Burke\n&gt; JBoss, a division of Red Hat\n&gt; http://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n\n"}}
