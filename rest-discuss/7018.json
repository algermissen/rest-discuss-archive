WTF?  I mean, this problem&#39;s as\n&gt; old as the web, distributing named userspace directories /~someuser/ across\n&gt; multiple servers has long been a problem *with a solution* that doesn&#39;t\n&gt; inconvenience users like this!\nI noticed that Amazon&#39;s S3 storage system recently did something\nsimilar. However, there is more to &#39;user directories&#39; than\npartitioning the URI across back end machines. Another name for\n&#39;domain&#39; is &#39;authority&#39;. When you host web applications, many security\nconsiderations are based on the &#39;authority&#39; of content within that\napplication - the domain name. Cookies and script for example both are\nconstrained by the browser to operate within the originating\nauthority. By using the same host name for all applications from all\norganizations, this partitioning by authority isn&#39;t possible.\nI haven&#39;t seen any reports of cross-site scripting attacks or cookie\npeeking, but I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s what is possible when many\napplication authors are put into the same authority/domain.\n\nI agree with you though that routing to multiple back-end hosts for\nscale and availability doesn&#39;t require additional DNS names. It may be\nsimple and effective in many situations, but it isn&#39;t the only strong\napproach.\n\n"}}
