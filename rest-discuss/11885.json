Since GET \nreturns an entity representing the current state of a resource, I don&#39;t \nthink there is any clear meaning of this in return to a GET (and by \nextension a HEAD). The only methods defined in 2616 that it makes sense \nfor to my mind are POST, PUT and DELETE, though it is correct that 2616 \ndoesn&#39;t give a list of appropriate methods, as it has to be applicable \nto the addition of methods to HTTP by extensions or later versions.\n\n&gt; I had remarked in a blog  [1] that 202 is a good response to the GET\n&gt; the user agent performs on the Location header from a previous 303.\n\nI would disagree. The 202 should come from the POST or the PUT instead \nof the 303, to indicate they pending state in response to the POST or \nPUT. Returning 202 to the GET indicates the GET has caused something to \nhappen that may or may not be fully dealt with later. Since GET \nshouldn&#39;t cause anything to &quot;happen&quot;, this indicates the semantics of \nGET have violated.\n\nIf there were a clear reason to favour 303 to a GETtable resource \nindicating the current processing state over 202, then the resource \nrepresenting this processing state should be represented with a 200 \nrather than a 202.\n\n&gt; Widespread interpretation of 202 for GET this way would be dang\n&gt; useful, does anyone else think so, or object ?\n\nObject. 202 means something might or might not happen, GET promises \nnothing will happen.\n\n\n"}}
