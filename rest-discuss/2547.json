There are many reasons\n&gt; why you want to do this:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) The client should be explicitly aware of resource creation. When\n&gt; the client PUTs a resource they have no way of actually knowing\n&gt; whether they&#39;re simply updating a resource or creating a brand new\n&gt; resource. These are two very different things and you should force\n&gt; the client to acknowledge the distinction using POST.\n\nUmm.  I thought the difference between a 200 response for updating of an\nexisting resource and a 201 response indicating the creation of a new\nresource dealt with that.  I am not trying to argue for the use of PUT, mind\nyou.  I&#39;m just not sure that your statement is true.\n\n&gt; 2) Because of the principle of URI opacity, it&#39;s in poor taste to\n&gt; let the client assign URIs to new resources. Only the server should\n&gt; know about URI construction.\n\nWith the exception of Query Strings, of course.  Beyond that, I mostly\nagree... more on this in a separate post...\n\n&gt; 6) I think the RFC is just being flexible. AFAIK, POST as always\n&gt; meant APPEND TO DOCUMENT/PROCESS DOCUMENT and PUT as always meant\n&gt; WRITE.\n\nI think also that the RFC is carrying around some old &quot;static hypertext\ndocument&quot; baggage.  In that context (and ignoring REST for the moment), it\nwould make sense to have a verb that allowed easy maintenance of html files\nsitting on a remote server.  The only reason PUT didn&#39;t catch was due to the\nexisting, well established FTP network and tools.  There was no incentive to\nswitch to PUT, add security headaches to the HTTP server, etc. when FTP\nalready provided that without changing a thing...\n\n&gt; So, for hopefully the last time, I&#39;d say use POST to mean resource\n&gt; creation and PUT to mean update.\n\nClarification... POST can also be used to update an existing resource.  The\ndifference(s) between a POST and PUT update are:\n\n1) POST does not directly cause the resource to be updated, while PUT does.\nyes, I know that neither actually does it directly, bit we conceptually\nthink of them being indirect and direct (respectively).\n2) POST is meant to mutate, or partially update, a resource while PUT is\nmeant to entirely replace the resource.  yes, it would be possible for POST\nto effectively perform a replace as well.\n\nI have had some thoughts on this too... again, I&#39;ll elaborate in a follow-up\nmessage...\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
