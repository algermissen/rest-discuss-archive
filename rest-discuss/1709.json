You won&#39;t find any\n&gt; &gt; mention of TCP in RFC 2616 (I hope - I don&#39;t have it handy) for example,\n&gt; &gt; but XHTML couldn&#39;t exist without XML.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;HTTP communication usually takes place over TCP/IP connections. The\n&gt; default port is TCP 80 [19], but other ports can be used. This does not\n&gt; preclude HTTP from being implemented on top of any other protocol on the\n&gt; Internet, or on other networks. HTTP only presumes a reliable transport;\n&gt; any protocol that provides such guarantees can be used; the mapping of\n&gt; the HTTP/1.1 request and response structures onto the transport data\n&gt; units of the protocol in question is outside the scope of this\n&gt; specification.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; But you can imagine a similar state for XHTML (in a world where there\n&gt; were multiple competing markup language syntaxes):\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;This does not preclude XHTML from being encoded in any other syntax.\n&gt; XHTML only presumes a concept of &#39;element&#39; and &#39;attribute&#39;. Blah blah\n&gt; blah blah.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; In fact it is very trendy these days to define markup languages in terms\n&gt; of the &quot;infoset&quot; and say that &quot;any mapping from any syntax to the\n&gt; infoset is legal.&quot; So you could imagine an XHTML this is an extension to\n&gt; the &quot;infoset&quot; but the infoset would be a layer on top of XML itself.\n&gt; (after all, it has been implemented on top of relational databases etc.)\n\nFWIW we do something similar, and imho more convincing, with RDF. RDF is\ndefined in its own world of edge-labelled graphs, with any mapping to XML\n(or to unicode/text) being fine. And there _are_ non-XML syntaxes that\nwork for exchanging RDF, so there&#39;s definitely some layering going on. Flipside\nof that is disconnection: by remaining aloof from nitty gritty of the\n&#39;lower&#39; layers, the loftier layer risks reinventing useful stuff from\nbelow. In SOAP&#39;s case, content negotiation etc.; in RDF&#39;s case, query\nmechanisms (XPath, XQuery etc).
