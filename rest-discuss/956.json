An XML document is a data structure;\nthe hyperstructure of the Web is a data structure.  Some data structures can\nencode algorithms --- for example, an XSLT transform is an XML data structure\nthat is also a Turing-complete algorithmic language.  The hyperstructure of the\nWeb is not an algorithmic language.\n\nIt is well-known that algorithms can represent things that cannot be explicitly\nrepresented without computation.  If URIspace is intended to contain all possible\ninformation --- and I assume that it is --- then non-generative naming and\nhypermedia are not sufficient by themselves to refer to all the things URIspace\nis intended to contain.  Generative names are not Turing-complete algorithmic\nlanguages either, of course, but they do provide a mechanism by which references\nto objects may be computed.  Without generative names, the Web can contain things\nthat cannot be referred to without a priori knowledge of the thing.\n\nGive a person a fish, and you&#39;ve fed him dinner.  Teach a person to fish, and\nyou&#39;ve fed them for life.  Give a person a URI, and you&#39;ve given him a reference\nto a resource.  Teach a person to make URIs to your resources, and you&#39;ve given\nhim references to all of them.\n\nJust a thought before bed.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
