I think I have a vague sense of what it \n&gt;&gt;&gt;is,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;but I&#39;m not sure I understand why its important.  I took a look at\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Fielding&#39;s thesis, but I didn&#39;t see much at all on visibility.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;What it said was pretty good though, even just this sentence;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&quot;Visibility in this case refers to the ability of a component to \n&gt;&gt;monitor\n&gt;&gt;or mediate the interaction between two other components. &quot;\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Why it&#39;s important?  Hmm...\n&gt;\n&gt;There are several places where it comes into play:\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n[. . .]\n\nSo is it fair to say that visibility is about a third party&#39;s ability to \nunderstand the intent or meaning of a message or an interaction?  And \nincreasing visibility is about making it as easy as possible for a third \nparty to figure out the intent/meaining of a message?\n\nAlso, does visibility imply the ability of any arbitrary third party to \nunderstand a message, or does it just mean the ability for some \nparticular third party to be able to understand the message.  In other \nwords, is visibility, to a ceratin extent, application specific (and by \napplication I dont mean HTTP, I mean my particular web app built on top \nof HTTP)?\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n\n\n"}}
