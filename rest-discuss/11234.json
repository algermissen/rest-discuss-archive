This is perhaps the way you would like the world to be.  \nBut REST is just about resources and representations. You may think  \nsomething ending in a slash/ refers to a directory, but it could also  \nbe a concept, a building, a person, an ontology, or any other number  \nof things...\n\n\n&gt; Its better than &quot;kind&quot; imho, but what I don&#39;t like about this is that\n&gt; it re enforces the notion that the URI template thing ( or pretty\n&gt; URLs) is very important and should match directly to something in your\n&gt; actual system.\n\nPretty URLs are very useful for maintaining a site. But what is pretty  \nto you may not be to someone else, and you will never be able to  \ncontrol anything other than your own site. By all means do try to do  \nthings in an intuitive way, but don&#39;t confuse that with the much more  \ngeneral nature of REST.\n\nHenry\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Devdatta\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] http://www.agilemodeling.com/style/packageDiagram.htm\n&gt;\n&gt; 2008/9/2 Alexander Johannesen &lt;alexander.johannesen@...&gt;:\n&gt;&gt; On Tue, Sep 2, 2008 at 11:47, Stefan Tilkov  \n&gt;&gt; &lt;stefan.tilkov@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m trying to describe the process of RESTful application (or\n&gt;&gt;&gt; interface) design. Maybe I should just leave it &quot;decide which  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; kinds of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; resources you want to expose&quot;, but I was wondering whether this  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;kind&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; thing\n&gt;&gt;&gt; merits its own term.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Good question. I think the answer is &#39;yes&#39;, but as such not defined\n&gt;&gt; within the REST scope itself.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I tend to favor DDD (Domain-driven Design) these days, so every\n&gt;&gt; primary entity and their immediate entities have a guaranteed  \n&gt;&gt; resource\n&gt;&gt; exposure, whether I have an actual pre-defined use for them or not.  \n&gt;&gt; (I\n&gt;&gt; know this sounds strange and even bad practice to a lot of people,  \n&gt;&gt; but\n&gt;&gt; it has saved the day in too many projects for me to ignore their\n&gt;&gt; usefulness :) After that there&#39;s some heavy thinking about &quot;what kind\n&gt;&gt; of stuff you want to expose&quot; which normally ends up in a few good\n&gt;&gt; workshops. Not sure that &quot;kind&quot; can even be typified, but I guess\n&gt;&gt; there&#39;s that useful portmanteau of &quot;things&quot; and &quot;actions&quot; that can be\n&gt;&gt; defined a bit (and this resonates well with the minimal REST\n&gt;&gt; interface).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Alex\n&gt;&gt; --\n&gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Project Wrangler, SOA, Information Alchemist, UX, RESTafarian,  \n&gt;&gt; Topic Maps\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------ http://shelter.nu/blog/  \n&gt;&gt; --------\n&gt;&gt;\n\n\n"}}
