I can even call OPTIONS on the resource first to see \n&gt; if it allows me to alter the order.  For new orders, GET and PUT can be \n&gt; returned.  For canceled or shipped orders, just GET is returned.  And at \n&gt; any time I can GET /orders/new, /orders/canceled, /orders/shipped, etc.  \n&gt; Trying to alter any of those resources returns 405 Method Not Allowed.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, I can see making things like /canceled etc. writable, if your \n&gt; requirement was to treat an order cancellation as a thing unto itself \n&gt; (Wall St. probably works that way), and you wanted to allow users to \n&gt; track a cancellation and allow the business to report easily on \n&gt; cancellations.  But that doesn&#39;t seem to work here, where an order can \n&gt; &quot;move itself&quot; into other states, like shipped.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, where did I go off the rails?\n\nThere is nothing wrong with a collection changing in-between\nGETs. CANCELLED and SHIPPED bins are shared resources and unless a client\ncan have exclusive control over them, it simply has to expect that\nthey may change without its knowledge.\n\n\nYS.\n\n"}}
