I tried to describe that in my last (IIRC) message.\n\n&gt; The terms in this space are very overloaded, but call it a Commitment \n&gt; (in the speech act or REA sense, not in the database sense) or a \n&gt; Promise (related to but not quite the same as the E-Lang creature of \n&gt; the same name)?\n&gt; \n&gt; The speech act or REA meaning of Commitment is a promise to perform \n&gt; an event in the future.  When the event occurs, it fulfills the \n&gt; promise (or doesn&#39;t, as the case may be.)  A Commitment can have a \n&gt; time constraint.\n&gt; \n&gt; The implementation could be similar to Offer-Acceptance:  the \n&gt; Commitment has a URI to which the promisor POSTs the promised event.\n\nYep, it would be really good for that.  We need some good APIs for\nclient web *server* integration, so that you can create these\nmailboxes/futures/promises really easily.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
