So, I believe the most natural\nsolution would be to encode the resource scoping information in the URI\nlike this:\n\nGET /computers/1+2+3+4+5+6/temperature\n\nbut of course this doesn&#39;t scale beyond a certain limit (the URI gets to\nlarge and hits the limits of the most popular HTTP servers).\n\nThe alternative would be to first save your subset of computer IDs on\nthe server by creating a new temporary resource with a PUT or a POST and\nthen reference it in a GET. However this looks cumbersome, and leads to\n2 requests when 1 would do it.\n\nPlus, if the service was meant to be read-only it wouldn&#39;t even be\npossible.\n\nWhat would be a possible RESTful approach here?\n\nThanks,\n\nFree Ekanayaka\n\nPS: it seems that other people already have raised this issue, for\nexample the real-life problem I described is a variation of the sample\nproblem described here:\n\nhttp://blog.labix.org/2009/07/23/accessing-restful-information-efficiently\n\n"}}
