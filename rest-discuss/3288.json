Isn&#39;t\nthat\n&gt; what the OPTIONS method is for?  Shouldn&#39;t you be able to do an OPTIONS\nrequest\n&gt; on the resource itself and have whatever meta information returned?  That\nway\n&gt; there&#39;s no need for two resources with links back to each other.\n&gt;\nHuh. I thought I looked at OPTIONS and it wasn&#39;t appropriate... don&#39;t know\nwhat I was thinking. Maybe I was looking only at what methods were\nallowed...\nThis seems like the best approach so far.\n\n\nHere&#39;s the text from the RFC. The only downside is responses are not\ncacheable.\n====\nOPTIONS\nThe OPTIONS method represents a request for information about the\ncommunication options available on the request/response chain identified by\nthe Request-URI. This method allows the client to determine the options\nand/or requirements associated with a resource, or the capabilities of a\nserver, without implying a resource action or initiating a resource\nretrieval.\n\nResponses to this method are not cacheable.\n\nIf the OPTIONS request includes an entity-body (as indicated by the presence\nof Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding), then the media type MUST be\nindicated by a Content-Type field. Although this specification does not\ndefine any use for such a body, future extensions to HTTP might use the\nOPTIONS body to make more detailed queries on the server. A server that does\nnot support such an extension MAY discard the request body.\n\nIf the Request-URI is an asterisk (&quot;*&quot;), the OPTIONS request is intended to\napply to the server in general rather than to a specific resource. Since a\nserver&#39;s communication options typically depend on the resource, the &quot;*&quot;\nrequest is only useful as a &quot;ping&quot; or &quot;no-op&quot; type of method; it does\nnothing beyond allowing the client to test the capabilities of the server.\nFor example, this can be used to test a proxy for HTTP/1.1 compliance (or\nlack thereof).\n\nIf the Request-URI is not an asterisk, the OPTIONS request applies only to\nthe options that are available when communicating with that resource.\n\nA 200 response SHOULD include any header fields that indicate optional\nfeatures implemented by the server and applicable to that resource (e.g.,\nAllow), possibly including extensions not defined by this specification. The\nresponse body, if any, SHOULD also include information about the\ncommunication options. The format for such a\n\nbody is not defined by this specification, but might be defined by future\nextensions to HTTP. Content negotiation MAY be used to select the\nappropriate response format. If no response body is included, the response\nMUST include a Content-Length field with a field-value of &quot;0&quot;.\n\nThe Max-Forwards request-header field MAY be used to target a specific proxy\nin the request chain. When a proxy receives an OPTIONS request on an\nabsoluteURI for which request forwarding is permitted, the proxy MUST check\nfor a Max-Forwards field. If the Max-Forwards field-value is zero (&quot;0&quot;), the\nproxy MUST NOT forward the message; instead, the proxy SHOULD respond with\nits own communication options. If the Max-Forwards field-value is an integer\ngreater than zero, the proxy MUST decrement the field-value when it forwards\nthe request. If no Max-Forwards field is present in the request, then the\nforwarded request MUST NOT include a Max-Forwards field.\n\n\n\n"}}
