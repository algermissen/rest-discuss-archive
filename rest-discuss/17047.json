In order to do anything useful with the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; data, the client needs to know how to parse and attach semantic meaning to\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the data. In the same vein, the client would need to understand the semantic\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; meaning of form elements in order to correctly place data in the proper\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; elements when POSTing a request. I don&#39;t really see how an autonomous client\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can be built without some sort of out-of-band knowledge of those semantics.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Am I missing something?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;  no\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Clients, whether autonomous or not, should be informed of the semantics (or\n&gt;&gt; media type) of the message by the server.  This is done using the\n&gt;&gt; content-type header.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In an m2m situation xhtml, by itself, is rarely a useful media type.  Xhtml\n&gt;&gt; provides hypermedia application description semantics (&lt;a&gt;, &lt;link&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &lt;form&gt;) and document structuring semantics.  The document structuring\n&gt;&gt; semantics are of little direct use in most m2m scenarios.  However, one can\n&gt;&gt; define new media types that extend xhtml.  These extensions would inherit\n&gt;&gt; the application description semantics and add domain specific semantics to\n&gt;&gt; certain elements in the document.  You could serve the same octet sequence\n&gt;&gt; as `application/xhtml` to web browsers or as `application/vnd.myapp` to\n&gt;&gt; specialized autonomous clients.   The specialized media type would inform\n&gt;&gt; the autonomous client how to extract the information it cares about (either\n&gt;&gt; simple properties of the resource, simple relationships to other resources\n&gt;&gt; or complex instructions for further requests) from the representation.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I assume this is determined at runtime, right?  How does the client know\n&gt;&gt; what properties, relationships or complex instructions provide information\n&gt;&gt; on how to extract information?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; A client knows that the meaning of a message is because it has been taught\n&gt; (coded, configures or whatever) to understand the media type of that\n&gt; message.  When a client makes the request it can inform the server of the\n&gt; media types it is capable of handling use the `accept` request header.  An\n&gt; autonomous client would set that to `application/vnd.myapp`.  The server\n&gt; would (usually) respond with a representation conforming to the\n&gt; specification of `application/vnd.myapp`.  For example, the specification\n&gt; might say something like the representation is an xhtml representation and\n&gt; any element with a @class containing &#39;person&#39; can be treated as a person\n&gt; entity.\n\nIs this a joke? take xhtml redefine the meaning of @class to use \nambiguous string tokens in order to type entities (which are represented \nas what exactly in the message?) and serve it up as \napplication/vnd.myapp == &quot;RESTful&quot;??\n\nreally?\n\n"}}
