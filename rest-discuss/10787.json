In \nother technology cycles it might have be fine, but there was enough \nsolid criticism of the WS-* approach from very early on that it&#39;s hard \nto position moving away from it as a learning or evolutionary matter.\n\nAnd I can relate with Sean&#39;s statement on where the (mobile) telco \nindustry is going. I can&#39;t see SOAP based S/MMSCs and their ilk being \naround for the long haul. Mobile operators have become quite savvy on \nweb architecture, they just don&#39;t go about it as much as the webcos.\n\nBill\n\n"}}
