This although seems a bit like using the SOAP\n&gt;     &gt; &quot;action&quot; header and tunneling everyhting through a POST.\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; This is RPC, not a resource system.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Ok - Why do you say that?\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello Will,\n&gt;\n&gt; If you add control (action) information within anything else but http \n&gt; headers or verb, you break the uniform interface: the action depends \n&gt; on something that only your system can understand.\n&gt; It is not visible to intermediate layers what that request represents.\n&gt;\n&gt; Summing up, you lose visibility and you break the uniform interface\n&gt;\n&gt; You can create custom proxies that understand this kind of messages, \n&gt; but why do it if you already have the current ones in the real world \n&gt; working for you?\n\nThe proposal was to use content-type to indicate the nature of the POST, \nso it is equally visible - and this seems a more appropriate use of the \nuniform interface than partial updates with PUT.\n\nIf you take the approach of splitting up the user resource into more \ngranular &#39;sub-resources&#39;, but yet you continue to expose the main user \nresource as a composite resource that derives state from these new \nsub-resources; there is an equal overall loss in visibility:\n\nGET /user/1234\n...\n...\n  &lt;address uri=&quot;/user/1234/address&quot;&gt;London, UK&lt;/address&gt;\n...\n...\n\n\nPUT /user/1234/address\n&lt;address&gt;Paris, France&lt;/address&gt;\n\n\nGET /user/1234\n...\n...\n  &lt;address uri=&quot;/user/1234/address&quot;&gt;London, UK&lt;/address&gt; [??]\n...\n...\n\n\nThe above lacks visibility since the user resource&#39;s (composite) state \nhas been udpated &quot;invisibly&quot; as far as the system is concerned.\n\nObviously the solution here is to avoid composite resources and stick to \nhyperlinks only - most people use composite resources, however, because \nthey &#39;make things easier&#39; and/or it avoids the overhead that comes with \nthe increased number of HTTP requests required.\n\n- Mike\n\n"}}
