I wanted to correct a persistent\nmisinterpretation that Roy Fielding said something against CGI or\nagainst &quot;excessive gatewaying&quot;. Hopefully he&#39;ll correct me if I&#39;m wrong\nbut I think that his opinion is that gatewaying (CGI or whatever) is the\nright way to integrate non-Web systems with the Web and is a core part\nof web architecture. You have repeatedly cited that message in a manner\nI believe to be incorrect and I felt it was necessary to inform you (no\nmatter what the topic of discussion).\n-- \nCome discuss XML and REST web services at:\n  Open Source Conference: July 22-26, 2002, conferences.oreillynet.com\n  Extreme Markup: Aug 4-9, 2002,  www.extrememarkup.com/extreme/\n\n"}}
