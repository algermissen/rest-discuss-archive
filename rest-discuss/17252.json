And cloud storage services like Amazon S3 are nice examples of\n&gt; RESTful service. Likewise we&#39;ve seen some nice work in the version\n&gt; control space [2] that fits well w/ REST&#39;s use of Hypermedia as the\n&gt; Engine of Application State constraint. One could venture to say that\n&gt; the success of these technologies on the Web has largely been the\n&gt; result of the thought that has gone into REST.\n\nIndeed, I didn&#39;t intend to discredit the importance of REST, rather \nposition it as something to built on, a subset of what&#39;s needed for \nfull web architecture and network / component / application \nconsiderations. There is much scope wrt the CoD constraint, and much \nusage that is still undocumented / not understood thoroughly. Likewise \nmuch discussion of applying REST to the cloud storage APIs, for \ninstance S3 is more RPC over HTTP than REST, and REST is what you \nwould apply to the various cloud APIs in order to standardize them / \nmake them fully interoperable in a RESTful way. As for version control \nI was thinking more along the lines of git/hg/svn over http, however \nrfc5829 is a good example.\n\nOut of interest have you read the dissonance chapters (2&3) or CREST [1] ?\n\n[1] http://www.erenkrantz.com/CREST/\n\nBest,\n\nNathan\n\n"}}
