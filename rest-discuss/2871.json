That number is \nin the millions. The number of people who &quot;agreed&quot; on the details of \nHTTP are in the hundreds. I don&#39;t see how you can plausibly argue that \nthere is an O(2^N) relationship there. Much more often, the majority of \nthe people who adhere to a standard learn about it long after the \nstandardization process is done. They buy the books that describe the \nstandard (see also HTML). They don&#39;t even really &quot;agree&quot; to use it -- \ncertainly not bilaterally, anyhow! They just use what everyone else is \nusing, sometimes without even really wanting to!\n\nI really don&#39;t by the thesis that standards are created (or even \nadopted) through &quot;agreement&quot; between implementors and users.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
