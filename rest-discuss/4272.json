[deletia]\n.. &gt; Does this violate principle #4 above?  What other\n.. &gt; solutions would there be otherwise?\n.. \n.. I think, generally, the messages should contain this type of action. \n.. URIs really should describe resources -- fixed, tangible \n.. things ... not\n.. processes.  Messages can be POSTed to resources:\n.. \n.. What about...\n.. \n..

Location: /account/1/change/1\n\nTo me this seems worse than putting that operation name in\nthe URL, because you&#39;re instead putting it in the document\nbody, which seems even more RPC-ish.\n\nPerhaps it is a matter of nomenclature as Paul pointed out. In \nfact it&#39;s creating a merge-transaction resource, but to me \nthat &quot;-transaction&quot; suffix is implied and isn&#39;t necessary to \nadd to the uri.  The behavior of the\n\n \n.. One nice thing about this is it becomes more clear where to put\n.. something like /account/##/changes/ ... on the resource \n.. which contains\n.. it.\n\nI actually have a similar resource\n \n  /account/#/history\n\nbut isn&#39;t used to handle the processing of change request, only\nreturn a representation of the history of the account.\n\n\n"}}
