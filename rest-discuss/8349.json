In particular, it is very useful when the UA\n&gt; is *not* a browser. This is often the case in an enterprise\n&gt; environment where you are exposing services for integration purposes,\n&gt; i.e. I am using it instead of WS-* in the enterprise. I am willing to\n&gt; be corrected, but I get the sense that many on this list are targeting\n&gt; browsers over the web - a quite different proposition.\n&gt; \nServices was definitely the context I was thinking about, particularly\ndata services.\n\nRod Smith of IBM hosted a small enterprise mashup summit in San Francisco\nyesterday.  One of the (inevitable) topics that came up was the use of REST \nversus WS-*/SOAP data services.  I was surprised to hear that in general, \ncompanies prefer the simplicity of REST and use it widely, but consider SOAP\nas more &#39;reusable.&#39; In this particular context, &#39;reusable&#39; actually meant having\na readily available description of the service,  something that REST \nservices are perceived to be lacking.   ARK was also mentioned during the day,\nthe first time I heard of it.  (Norman&#39;s post this morning was the second.)\n  \n&gt; For me, the critical aspect of a content-negotiation implementation is\n&gt; to have a representation format that is the superset of all\n&gt; information about the resource (both data and metadata). I typically\n&gt; use RDF for this purpose. Then, if an alternate representation format\n&gt; is requested, the task is simply to cut down the data to the subset\n&gt; required for the alternate representation.\n\nThis seems like a good approach. Most of the data cases I&#39;m working with \nseem to fall into a model where the metadata is an extension of the data, \nalthough that may not always be true.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Alan Dean\n&gt; http://thoughtpad.net/alan-dean\n\n\n-- \nmikeyp@...                                                    http://www.snaplogic.org\n\n"}}
