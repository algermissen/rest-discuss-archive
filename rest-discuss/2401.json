If they are\nallowed to refresh when they see fit, that would demand a pretty strict \ninterpretation of safety.\n\nAll that being said, I still think the Google interface should be \nGET-able even without a strictly idempotent GET.  Their choice of \n1000 hits is right on the hairy edge of where it would even matter to a \ncasual developer (the audience they seem to be targeting right now).\nFor this audience it is effectively idempotent.  Had they chosen \nsomething like a million hits the limit would probably never get hit\nby anyone, and requiring a POST would be overly strict.\n\nNot being able to do some of the XSLT stuff I&#39;ve been doing with Xoomle\nand Amazon makes the current Google API less than useful. :[\n\nThanks all,\n\n- Jeff\n\n\n\n"}}
