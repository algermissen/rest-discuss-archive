In order for the client to select among\n&gt; the potentially numerous URIs for the object, you should describe the\n&gt; reason that there are multiple URIs and the advantages of each.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Paul Prescod\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
