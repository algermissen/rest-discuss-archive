Lots of books with comflicting descriptions of\n&gt;&gt; good REST would be bad.\n&gt;\n&gt; Good in some ways.\n&gt;\n&gt; The core idea of REST is simple. It&#39;s relatively simple to point out \n&gt; basic flaws in the core description of REST. Of course that doesn&#39;t make \n&gt; it impossible for people to write books, but an orchestrated campaign of \n&gt; book-burning is probably outside of our capabilities :) Bad books can&#39;t \n&gt; be prevented (why we have the term bullshildt in the first place, hey \n&gt; Shildt&#39;s publishers say he&#39;s an authority too) only good ones encouraged.\n&gt;\n&gt; Outside of that, when dealing with concrete cases matters will very \n&gt; quickly get into cases where differences of opinion will enter and also \n&gt; where matters outside of REST will have to be addressed (you can&#39;t \n&gt; cookbook without going beyond REST, your very first example will have to \n&gt; include some server settings or some code or at least some markup and \n&gt; immediately you&#39;ve got something there that isn&#39;t just REST).\n\nCome on fella&#39;s. This is a bit silly.\n\nThe central aim is a good one: collect a lot of experience in a more\nformal, recipe/cookbook way.\n\nThat&#39;s step 1.\n\nIf we then find that we violently disagree about some patterns\n(actually, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s very likely) then we&#39;ll deal with that\nthen.\n\nBut for now brain dump is required somewhere.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   \n\n"}}
