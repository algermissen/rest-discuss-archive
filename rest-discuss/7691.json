I’m trying to find it. IIRC, it suggests pretty\n&gt;  &gt; using the URLs as above with multiple formats served on the primary\n&gt;  &gt; URL based on the Accept header. It might have also involved 302s.\n&gt; \n&gt; I guess the issue here comes down to URI proliferation for a single\n&gt; resource. Mike Schinkel was asking about this recently; I think this is\n&gt; a case where a) multiple URIs one resource makes some kind of sense, b)\n&gt; it&#39;s becoming an idiomatic design pattern for web apps anyway. There is\n&gt; the accept/content-* machinery but no-one (statistically speaking) uses\n&gt; that stuff to obtain &quot;the pdf&quot; or whatever.\n\n&quot;print this page&quot; falls under the idiom as well. Any usability people on \nthe list?\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
