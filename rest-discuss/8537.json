I&#39;m not sure what to make of it,\n&gt; \n&gt; Hmm, can you explain your intention a bit further? I am having trouble \n&gt; seeing your issue.\n\nWhy am I targeting a server instead of the resources?\n\n&gt; The coupling you talk about seems to me to be the coupling between the \n&gt; code that uses the library and the media type the library is implemented \n&gt; for.\n\nI was thinking of API creep away from uniformity and towards implicit \nidentity:\n\n   doc = s.get_document_for_user(docid, user)\n\nSuddenly the client API is usable for only one domain/problem. It might \neven end up sharing interfaces or exceptions with a server API. I was \nalso thinking about treating the server as though it were actually in \nthe same address space/stack.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
