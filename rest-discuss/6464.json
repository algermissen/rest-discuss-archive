When I do a PUT, I expect the server to \n&gt; modify the \n&gt; resource I target based on the *representation* I send. If that \n&gt; representation happens to be of type \n&gt; application/x-www-form-urlencoded, \n&gt; so be it. In general, I would expect a server to just store \n&gt; the content, \n&gt; and do nothing more. \n\nYour origin server handling the PUT is the main responsible of the\nprocessing that takes place. It could store the input in a database, in the\nfile system or in a content repository for example. What matters is that is\nrespects the general HTTP PUT semantics and that it has a consistent\nbehavior across the application.\n\n&gt; Of course if the resource being authored happens to have a \n&gt; specific type \n&gt; that can be represented as a set of name/value pairs (a \n&gt; property map), \n&gt; the server could parse the body, extract the data and persist it in a \n&gt; different way. But that&#39;s an edge case, not the general one. \n&gt; But doing \n&gt; that although the nature of the resource is being something \n&gt; else (say, \n&gt; an MP3), would be a violate the semantics of PUT. \n\nAgreed.\n \n&gt; That is, a toolkit that blindly parses \n&gt; application/x-www-form-urlencoded \n&gt; content upon PUT IMHO has a severe bug. What it should do is \n&gt; allow the \n&gt; code that implements PUT to have that content parsed *optionally*. \n\nExactly, and that&#39;s what happens with Restlets. By default, you use the\ninput representation unchanged with Call.getInput(). It&#39;s only if you invoke\nCall.getInputAsFrom() that it attempts to parse the content.\n\nCheers,\nJerome\nhttp://www.restlet.org\n\n\n"}}
