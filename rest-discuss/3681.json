I would like to expose this in a naive \nfashion to via a RESTful interface;  i.e., assuming something like\n\nGET /Entity --&gt; a representation of the extent (all instances of class \n/ rows in associated table)\nGET /Entity?id=xxx --&gt; a represenation of the particular instance of \nEntity with id=xxx\nPOST /Entity &lt;-- some representation of an Entity --&gt; creates new \n/Table?id=yyy, redirects to it\n\nIt would be nice to have:\n\n(1) a declarative way to describe the ER table.  There are many of \nthese that generate DDL and object stubs or code\n(2) a declarative way to map the ER model to a resource model / URI \nnamespace\n(3) a runtime framework which glues the two together\n(4) preferably Python, but patterns / research in this area of any type \nis good\n(5) abstraction of view / controller and app workflow to generate UI \nfrom declarative description a plus\n\nWaterken looks interesting, but the capability stuff is \novercomplicating unless it solves a specific problem you&#39;ve got.\n\nKuhlman&#39;s FSM stuff is close, but no cookie:  modeling workflows, not \nan ER or object model.\n\nAnyone one else?\n\njb\n\n\n"}}
