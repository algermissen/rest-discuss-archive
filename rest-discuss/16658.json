Using +json simply doesn&#39;t square with that definition, but it has\n&gt; nothing to do with me in any fashion, regardless of benign intent on the\n&gt; part of whomever suggests otherwise.\n&gt;\n&gt; Even if we assume json-schema is approved as written, how do I look up\n&gt; the sender intent of application/vnd.foo+json? Discussing alternatives\n&gt; or improvements to the IANA registry is non-sequitir if we can&#39;t agree\n&gt; on the fundamental reason behind such changes, which is that such\n&gt; identifiers are *not* self-descriptive *unless* they&#39;re registered.\n&gt;\n&gt; What is it about json-schema that automatically defines a processing\n&gt; model such that *everything* ending in +json is automatically self-\n&gt; descriptive despite not being registered? That sounds to me like\n&gt; saying that *everything* ending in +xml is automatically self-\n&gt; descriptive by virtue of having schema languages -- that just *isn&#39;t*\n&gt; the definition of self-descriptive, which requires registration.\n&gt;\nThe JSON Schema I-D doesn&#39;t attempt to make any normative claims on\nsuch processing model, it merely indicates that the schema *can* be\nthe target of the schema reference (whether the reference be a media\ntype parameter, relation, documented, or ESP-based), and suggests a\ncouple ways that the schema can be referenced. The I-D quite candidly\nindicates that it can&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t enforce any normative mechanism\non other JSON media types for if and how they reference a schema.\n\nThanks,\n\n- -- \nKris Zyp\nSitePen\n(503) 806-1841\nhttp://sitepen.com\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.9 (MingW32)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org/\n \niEYEARECAAYFAkyb2xIACgkQ9VpNnHc4zAzFDQCdHLUfxeIjnEdg9NWhYQxAIK2e\n9EUAnRseerCOjrHz67P1JFAWtbkBuz8g\n=jOvB\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n\r\n--------------000903000007010403080808\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta content=&quot;text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1&quot;\n      http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body bgcolor=&quot;#ffffff&quot; text=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- &lt;br&gt;\n    Hash: SHA1 &lt;br&gt;\n    &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    On 9/23/2010 4:22 PM, Eric J.
