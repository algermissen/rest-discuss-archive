It assumes that you are navigating through the data in the same\nway that you navigate through linked HTML pages.\n\n&gt; and that the retrieved resource provides a mechanism, such as an \n&gt; HTML form, that has an action that has the value of the resource&#39;s \n&gt; URI, and allows the client to append query parameters to retrieve \n&gt; further resources relative to that location?\n&gt; \n&gt; In this way the path section of the URI would be generated by the \n&gt; server, and the query string by the client.\n&gt; If this same URI was completely generated by the client, not \n&gt; relative to another resource within the path hierarchy, would it be \n&gt; more &#39;correct&#39; to put all parameters including the source location \n&gt; coordinates within the query string?\n\nAnother way to find a route might be to have a URI for routes.\n\n  GET /route\n\nThis resource contains a potentially infinite number of routes from all\nsources to all destinations. You then provide parameters to it to\nlimit the number of routes displayed. Perhaps the source and destination\nappear as dropdowns.\n\n  GET /route?source=tadwell&destination=norwich\n\nThe URI for a particular route may just be a hierarchy of locations.\n\n  /route/tadwell/bairnsdale/norwich\n\n(The place names are arbitrary and for demonstration only as\n they are more understandable than the XY coords. )\n\nJust an idea,\nDonald.\n\n\n"}}
