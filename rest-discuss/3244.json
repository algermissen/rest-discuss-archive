Specifically, I am talking about the ability for a URI\nauthority to indicate in a computer-readable format the composition rules of\na given URI?  For instance, suppose there was a document that looked\nsomething like (loosely based on regex):\n\nhttps?://example.invalid/(isbn)\nisbn = {regex pattern for ISBNs}\n\nThis would have two uses:\n\n1) Allows the client to infer structure and create &quot;valid&quot; URIs that were\nnot explicitly given to them by the server.\n2) Be able to extract information out or URIs that are explicitly given to\nthem by the server (obviously with a bit of human help).\n\nIf Jon had been given something like the above, he could have just told his\nprogram to find the part that matches &quot;isbn&quot;.  If Amazon chose to change the\n(preferably, add a new) URI pattern to something like:\n\nhttps?::/example.invalid/somepath/(isbn)/(nuflag)\nisbn = {regex pattern for ISBNs}\nnuflag = &quot;new&quot; | &quot;used&quot;\n\nJon&#39;s program would keep working because it still new where to find the\nappropriate information.  This would allow looser coupling and high\ncohesion.  Just a thought....\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\nFrom: &quot;Bill de h�ra&quot; &lt;dehora@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Seairth Jacobs wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The problem here is not that Jon extracted information out of the URI.\nThe\n&gt; &gt; problem is that Jon is relying on Amazon to not change it&#39;s URIs in a\nway\n&gt; &gt; that will break his technique.  Had Amazon said &quot;one can extract ISBNs\nfrom\n&gt; &gt; our URIs thus&quot;, then no one would be saying that what Jon did was a\nhack.\n&gt; &gt; This all goes back to the/my thought that as long as the server (or\nserver&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; authority) dictates how a given URI is composed, then it should be\nperfectly\n&gt; &gt; fine to extract information out of the URI.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yep. Low cohesion, high coupling.
