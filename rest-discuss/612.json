HTTP 1.1 assumes\n&gt; persistent connections by default, but that&#39;s not the same as assuming a\n&gt; streaming response returning notifications of state updates.  You still\n&gt; need a way for the user to request these updates.\n\nThats fine, I think.  If you offer notification,\nyou create URLs which represent the stream of\nchanges to some other URL (or collection of URLs).\nThe recipient then gets a chunk encoded stream of\nupdate messages.\n\n&gt; KnowNow does this because all their URIs are topics that behave in a\n&gt; particular way.  But that&#39;s not the case for an arbitrary URI.\n\nBasically the &quot;topic&quot; is the set of changes to a\nURL.\n\nHere is what I think the GET Events Protocol\nlooks like:\n\n1. The client PUTs a list of URLs on which it\nwants notification to some location.  (The client\nmay want to GET this list later and make changes).\n\n2. The server replies CREATED and sends back a\nlocation header with a notification URL at which\nthe client can recieve the notifications it just\nrequested.\n\n3. The client GETs this notification URL.\n\n4. The server sends a mime multipart\n   with each part being either:\n   * the new contents of each URL together with a\n     content-location header telling the client\n     the URL from which this data originates\n   -or-\n   * a message of content-type:\n     message/external-body; access-type=&quot;URL&quot;\n     and the URL that changed.\n   -or-\n   * a message of content-type application/x-diff\n   (The content is some representation of just\n    the diff that the recipient can use to\n    recreate the original)\n\n-Alex-\n\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
