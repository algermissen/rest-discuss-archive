You should have a form that\n&gt; requires explicit confirmation by the user.\n&gt; The reason is that I can submit someone else&#39;s email and the link in\n&gt; the email might be followed by the curious victim, or even by software\n&gt; that pre-fetches URLs. I then have a &#39;confirmed&#39; email but would be\n&gt; the only one with the credentials.\n\nNot if the credentials involve a password that was mailed only to the\nto-be-verified email address, but your other points stand.\n\nI still like the scheme I outlined above, but haven&#39;t figured out how\nto apply it to Lazy Registration.\n\nThe best I&#39;ve done is this: Say you have your standard\nbottom-of-the-blog-entry comment form, and your prospective member\ndecides to comment. You don&#39;t want to ship them off to another page,\nleast of all one you only give them the URL to in an email, or they&#39;re\nliable to decide it&#39;s all too much effort. The nice low-threshold form\nis right there, and it&#39;s one blog commenters are conditioned to\nalready: they type their name, email, and maybe web address in the\nboxes, type their comment, hit the button... et voila, they&#39;ve just\nLazily Registered\n\nNow, in my case I send them their initial password, rather than a GET\nlink, and if they now want to do anything that requires authen,\nthey&#39;re going to get to enter it on a web form anyway, to be POSTed or\nPUT somewhere. It&#39;s maybe stretching the definition a little to, as\npart of the authen, go and mark them as &quot;confirmed&quot; (since it&#39;s not\nnecessarily part of the resource they&#39;re creating/editing), but it&#39;s\nthe best I&#39;ve come up with, and it requires the minimum amount of\nintrusiveness.\n\n"}}
