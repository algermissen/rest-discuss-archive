If we\nbelieve that hiding the network is a Bad Thing (one of the arguments of *some*\npeople evangelising REST is that it doesn&#39;t hide it) then we have to conclude\nthat WSDL is a Bad Thing. The description of &quot;very attractive&quot; is quite apropos\ntherefore because hiding the network is very attractive; as are all\nanti-patterns.\n\nOn the other hand, just because we shouldn&#39;t hide it, do we need to look at it\nall the time? We don&#39;t want every piece of code that calls into a REST service\nto be primarily dealing in networking details, do we? (And if we do, to what\nextent - do I really want to know I received a 304 instead of a 200, or just\ninvisibly benefit from the inherent performance gain).\n\nOf course, since using a REST service tends to be simpler than using a SOAP\nservice (in and of themselves, before we add differences in tool support to the\nmix) there is less need for wrapping and hiding of the type WSDL uses.\nAs long as I can do some sort of HTTP with whatever I&#39;m using to develop I can\nquickly use a REST service - and build whatever degree of abstraction into this\nthat seems appropriate for the task in hand. \n\nWith the stock ticker that seems to be the &quot;hello world&quot; of web services I just\nneed to concatenate the stock symbol to the service URI and do a simple search\non the returned data. With a more complicated service I&#39;d probably want to\nremarshall into some sort of OOP or Generic+OOP equivalent - but then I might\nvery well want to re-wrap the model of a more RPC-style service to better match\nhow I use it anyway.\n\nMore complicated services gain the most from WSDL. But these services generally\nstill require a relatively large degree of orientation to start using. While\nsome are saying that this will be reduced or removed by a layer on top of WSDL\n(and on top of that, and on top of that) in the meantime this is still very\nimportant. If this part of the complexity grows faster than the part of the\ncomplexity removed by WSDL then the overall comparison still favours REST over\nSOAP+WSDL.\n\nOn balance REST+WSDL seems inferior to REST to me right now.\n\n-- \nJon Hanna\n&lt;http://www.hackcraft.net/&gt;\n&quot;�it has been truly said that hackers have even more words for\nequipment failures than Yiddish has for obnoxious people.&quot; - jargon.txt\n\n"}}
