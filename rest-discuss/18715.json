Linked Data, in using RDF with HTTP, encounters this issue\n&gt; but does not cause it.\n\ni strongly disagree. the issue has been punted to HTTP by RDF, and \nanother attempt was to punt it to URIs using hash URIs. the issue does, \nhowever, originate in RDF and its goal to be able to clearly separate \ntwo ontologically different classes of HTTP-identified resources, the \ninformation and the non-information resources. on the web, this is not \neven an issue that exists: you identify by URI whatever you deem \nappropriate, and if you need to distinguish described and description \nresources, you introduce describedby/described relations and manage them \nand serve them to whoever is interested and you&#39;re done. the current \ndebate around this issue is caused by the fact that for 1% of the web, \nthe semweb/linkeddata community, not being able to clearly distinguish \nbetween information and the non-information resources is a very real \npain. for the 99% of the web, however, it is not even a problem, and if \nsome community decided it wants to be really disciplined about it, it \ncould start using describedby/described (and maybe even register those \nlink relations, one of them actually already is), and the problem is \nsolved on the web without having to change the web. so the issue is \ndefinitely not one that is inherent to HTTP, it is one that is caused by \nthe specific way in which RDF has decided to use HTTP identifiers.\n\ncheers,\n\ndret.\n\n-- \nerik wilde | mailto:dret@...  -  tel:+1-510-2061079 |\n            | UC Berkeley  -  School of Information (ISchool) |\n            | http://dret.net/netdret http://twitter.com/dret |\n\n"}}
