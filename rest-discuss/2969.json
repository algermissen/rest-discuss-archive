For quite sometime I thought that WebServices\n&gt; should be more URI based, so I was glad to find that\n&gt; there is the whole theory behind that :). While I am\n&gt; trying to catch up with the REST literature I have a\n&gt; question of a more practicle  nature. I am wondering\n&gt; if there is an outgoing Open Source effort(s) which\n&gt; have a goal to build a web services infrustucture\n&gt; around REST principles.\n\nREST web services are the natural intersection of HTTP and perhaps its \nsuccessor protocol and various data encoding strategies like RSS, the \nsemantic web, SVG and XML in general. Any toolkit that combines the most \nappropriate data encoding for your problem domain with HTTP \nfunctionality is an open source REST tool. Examples include Zope, \nQuixote, Redfoot, Mason and the various J2EE tools.\n\nI&#39;m not saying that there is no room for new toolkits but my personal \nopinion is that if you combine a perfect toolkit for your data format \n(e.g. an RSS parser or RDF engine) with the perfect HTTP platform for \nyour language, you get a REST toolkit out of the combination &quot;for free.&quot; \nAnd further, it is somewhat dangerous (not entirely wrong, but somewhat \ndangerous) to try to tie the encoding and architecture/protocol more \nclosely.\n\nhttp://www.prescod.net/rest/encoding\n\nPerhaps an XML+HTTP+URIs package would be a good idea regardless. But it \nwouldn&#39;t be a REST toolkit unless it also supported totally unstructured \ndata.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
