By &quot;client&quot; I mean the &quot;thing running the\napplication&quot; -- perhaps &quot;distributed user-agent&quot; is the right terminology\nhere. Consider an application that consists of multiple hypermedia formats,\ncould be VoiceXML + CCXML or Atom + HTML. It could be the case that the\nmarkup is processed by a single process or it could be that different\nprocesses are handling the individual markup languages and coordinating\nsomehow. The server is just seeing the HTTP requests and shouldn&#39;t really\ncare how the user agent is internally constructed. Of course as I mentioned\ncookies break this -- it&#39;s another way that they are not ideal.\nVoiceXML/CCXML systems can sometimes be broken into as many as 3 separate\ncomponents all making requests related to a single application session: the\nCCXML processor, the VoiceXML processor and a speech processor (performing\nspeech recognition and fetching grammar files). Some of the related\nprotocols have mechanisms to try and coordinate cookies: e.g.\nhttp://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-speechsc-mrcpv2-20#section-6.2.15\n\n&lt;http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-speechsc-mrcpv2-20#section-6.2.15&gt;Anyways,\nit&#39;s just food for thought.\n\nActually, at second glance, CCXML seems more akin to Xforms -- is it an\n&gt; MVC application the server transfers to the user agent?  MVC on the\n&gt; user agent is a powerful REST design pattern that can be adapted to\n&gt; m2m.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Eric\n&gt;\n\nThat&#39;s maybe one way to think about it. It is a finite state machine that\ncommunicates via messages/events to resources in an underlying client\nplatform. Events cause state transitions, transitions handlers can send\nmessages back to the platform or place HTTP requests to transition to a new\npage (or do various other things).
