I&#39;m proposing a 1-3 page \n&gt; concise description, with examples.\n\nThe trouble is REST isn&#39;t just one implemented thing. Because it&#39;s an\narchtitectural style you need a myriad of examples.\n\nI wish the REST wiki was better and could collect the various articles that\npeople write (I wrote one for example:\nhttp://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2006/02/23/using-rest-with-ajax.html)\n\n\nMaybe the thing to do is contribute yourself, to the REST wiki, a\ndescription of REST as you understand it and then we can all help you edit\nit.\n\nI might add a few ARRs for example.\n\n\n--\nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n\n"}}
