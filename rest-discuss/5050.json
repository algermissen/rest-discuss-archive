As a family, they didn&#39;t look like\nmuch, but they got=\r\n on with things. Indeed some would say that they had\nbeen second thoughts s=\r\nince grand-parents, Netscape, Microsoft, Apache\nand Berners-Lee, preferred =\r\nto fawn and monopolistically squabble over\ncousins, Blink and Marquee Tag, =\r\nthe mobile duo, Java Applet and\nActiveX, and the gruesome but quietly effic=\r\nient twins, CSS and\nJavaScript. Let&#39;s not forget the ugly outlier, the Beha=\r\nviour, and that\nperennial favourite of old Sir Tim, Semantic Purity. Still =\r\nthose\npragmatic matchmakers, Fielding and Andreesson got together,\nsacrific=\r\ned a few goats on the altar of sloppy expediency and dotcom\nhubris respecti=\r\nvely and got the marriage together. The good Reverend\nHTTP was the officiat=\r\ning priest. Thus they called for a great many\nfestivities and plenty palm w=\r\nine and Schnapps was consumed by the\nmerry populace. Yahoo! and Google, the=\r\ny ululated as they devoured the\nfatted Browser calf.\n\n[snip]\n\nhttp://korant=\r\neng.blogspot.com/2005/05/unloved-html-button-and-other.html\n\nWorking as I a=\r\nm in the bowels of (x)forms land, I have been wondering\nhow exactly we are =\r\ngoing to tighten things up so that we no longer\ngive the vast majority of a=\r\npplication authors enough rope to shoot\nthemselves in the foot, to mix my m=\r\netaphors.\n\nThis is a general issue also with REST, a style much misundersto=\r\nod\neven if fiercely advocated on this and other forums.\n\nMy conclusion is t=\r\nhat View Source is the thing. I&#39;m going to try to\nrefrain from further inte=\r\nrventions and instead make sure that there is\nenough quality code out there=\r\n to convince harried hotshot programmers\nto do the right thing. The REST wi=\r\nki needs serious additions in this\nlight.\n\nI do like a good flamefest thoug=\r\nh, it clears the air, but these days I\ndoubt the efficacy of that approach =\r\nand the things exposed by Google&#39;s\nWeb Accelerator give me pause.\n\nAnyway l=\r\net me stop preaching to the choir... \n\nShow me the code, right?\n\n-- \nKorant=\r\neng\n--\nKoranteng&#39;s Toli - the blog edition\nhttp://koranteng.blogspot.com/\n\n"}}
