Currently=\r\n, we have nice pattern matching on HTTP\nmethods and URIs, but still lack co=\r\nntent-type matching.  Well, 2 out\nof 3 is not a bad start.\n\nThe unit of com=\r\nmunication is messages, which contain a status code,\nheaders, and a body.  =\r\nMessages are modeled after HTTP messages,\nalthough they are not tied to any=\r\n specific implementation, making the\nDream runtime more portable.\n\nFinally,=\r\n RESTful design is promoted by providing guidelines (such as\nREST for the R=\r\nest of Us) and examples.  The framework itself permits\ndevelopers to implem=\r\nent non-RESTful services, just like an\nobject-oriented language facilitates=\r\n non object-oriented code.  The\nquestion of restricting design freedom is a=\r\n tough one.  It seems that\neven the best arguments are met with unusual, bu=\r\nt necessary exceptions\nto the rules.\n\nMy ongoing goal for Dream will be to =\r\nfacilitate tapping in to the\nexisting richness of HTTP and make it easier f=\r\nor developers to build\napplications with it.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n- Steve\n\n----------=\r\n----\nSteve G.
