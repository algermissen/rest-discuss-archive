REST is de=\r\nfined by\n&gt; &gt; four interface constraints:\n&gt; \n&gt; - identification of resources=\r\n;\n&gt; \n&gt; - manipulation of resources through representations;\n&gt; \n&gt; - self-des=\r\ncriptive messages; and,\n&gt; \n&gt; - hypermedia as the engine of application stat=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; you get the idea that this is about GET, DELETE, POST or PUT? Wh=\r\nere\n&gt; does ot talk about verbs?\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;m not sure what &quot;ot&quot; means.  A self-d=\r\nescriptive request includes a\nrequest method.  You can&#39;t have a request wit=\r\nhout one.  An intermediary\nSHOULD mark as expired, any resource for which i=\r\nt has seen a DELETE\nrequest, regardless of content-type or cache headers or=\r\n anything else.\nThe reason an intermediary knows this, is because a DELETE =\r\nmethod is\nself-descriptive, by virtue of the request method.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, in =\r\nyour interpretation of the semantics of a REST-style\n&gt; architecture, taken =\r\nthen it&#39;s not all about the web, and so it&#39;s not\n&gt; the same as HTTP, what&#39;s=\r\n the role of media-types? For what you said,\n&gt; there&#39;s no use to them.\n&gt; \n\n=\r\nDon&#39;t misunderstand the purpose of a media type.  Without setting\nContent-t=\r\nype: application/xhtml+xml, none of my XHTML 1.1 content would\ntrigger the =\r\nXML parser in browsers, but would instead be rendered as\nHTML.  The applica=\r\ntion/xhtml+xml media type informs clients, servers\nand intermediaries that =\r\nthe content of the entity is HTML as XML.\n\nA media type of application/jpg =\r\ntells a client to use its JPEG library\nto render the image.  If a server on=\r\nly outputs PNG, then the presence\nof application/jpg in the request message=\r\n lets the application know\nthat it needs to transform the image and save it=\r\n as a PNG.  You don&#39;t\nneed HTTP to have a media type, in fact they&#39;re deriv=\r\ned from MIME types\nused by the SMTP protocol.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I can have my server dis=\r\ntinguish different operations for the same\n&gt; verb by using different media-=\r\ntypes. Is that unrestfull?\n&gt; \n\nAbsolutely, beyond any shadow of a doubt.  I=\r\nf you need different\noperations you use different methods.  If you have one=\r\n method that\nmeans one thing for some resources, and something else for oth=\r\ner\nresources, then you do not have &quot;a consistent set of semantics for all\nr=\r\nesources&quot; you have semantics that vary by resource depending on media\ntype.=\r\n  This is expressly forbidden, and not anywhere near as\ncontroversial as th=\r\ne pushback against it in this thread would indicate.\n\n:-)\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The actual f=\r\nunction performed by the POST method is determined by the\n&gt; server. Is that=\r\n unrestfull also?\n&gt; \n\nNo, the semantics of POST are pretty loose.  In REST,=\r\n you describe a\nuniform interface for your resources.  That means you pick =\r\none meaning\nfor POST for your API and stick with it for all your resources.=\r\n  That\nmeaning mustn&#39;t already be covered in another method -- POST can nev=\r\ner\nmean DELETE because the semantics of deletion are already assigned to\nth=\r\ne DELETE method.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
