You can&#39;t assume that clients \noutside your system (ie most of them) will understand the processing \nassumptions built into your URIs; in the HTTP case, the protocol \nprovides somewhat for obtaining representations based on a mimetype.\n\nBut it does once again highlight the difficulty of the URI opacity \naxiom (cue Jeff Bone), tho&#39; I /think/ I saw TBL describe it as \nmerely being a good practice recently; maybe it&#39;s been downgraded.\n\nBill de h�ra\n\n\n\n"}}
