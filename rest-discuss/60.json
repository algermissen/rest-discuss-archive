You pay\nwith some ugliness to support web browsers.  Such\nis life.)\n\nYou also said:\n&gt; (the response is the same)\n\nNote true.  The simple MIME-RPC response:\n\n   HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\n   New York\n\nIn contrast, the REST would be:\n\n    HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n    Content-type: text/xml; charset=utf-8\n\n    &lt;state xmlns=&quot;http://foo.com/bar/namespace&quot;&gt;New York&lt;/state&gt;\n\nThe MIME-RPC response is much simpler.  The client\nis not required to parse XML and resolve a\nnamespace just to get at the answer.\n\nThe same arguments apply to your other examples\nso I won&#39;t expand on them here.  Nothing in\nMIME-RPC stops you from delivering an a text/xml\nas a response rather than a multipart/mixed.  I\nthink it depends on the application which makes\nthe most sense.\n\n&gt;  * rather than &quot;wasting&quot; the HTTP URL slot with /some/resource, the\n&gt; resource is the thing you are acting upon\n\nThis is a poor argument.  see above.\n\n&gt;  * when you&#39;re doing something idempotent, use GET, not POST\n\nI now realize that REST seems to want a new\nprotocol that isn&#39;t either HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1.\n\nClaim: idempotent requests should use GET\n\nReality: Many idempotent requests, e.g. SQL\ndatabase queries, can&#39;t be sent with GET, because\nthey are too large or entail too much structure.\n\nClaim: REST supports asynchronous messaging\n\nReality: REST appears to require use of HTTP and\nHTTP does not support asynchronous requests.\n\nClaim: Applications should define new HTTP methods\n\nReality: This is very difficult to deploy for many\nusers and there is no standards process for\ndefining these methods (limiting interop).\n\nOf course real life HTTP deployments may change\nand maybe the HTTP spec will evolve, but, right\nnow, the REST you describe appears to be\nincompatible with deployed infrastructure.\n\n&gt;  * use XML for structuring text rather than MIME.\n&gt;    * more compact\n&gt;    * easier to read\n\nVery debatable.  In the states example, the\nMIME-RPC response was easier to read and shorter.\nIn the baseball example, the multipart/mixed\nactually had fewer characters than the text/xml\nexampe.  Readability is in the eye of the\nbeholder.\n\n&gt;    * can use schema for validation\n\nWhen that is relevant to your application,\nMIME-RPC does not prevent you from using XML.\nHowever, in the states and baseball examples, I\ndon&#39;t think the validation is so useful.\n(Note: I a putting aside for the moment, my\ngeneral doubts about schema validation technology)\n\nMIME-RPC gives you the flexibility to do what you\nneed to do.  When you need to talk to web\nbrowsers, it supports you.  When you want RPC, it\nsupports you.  When you want to do asynchronous\nmessaging, it supports you.  When you want to do\nREST, it suppports you as well.\n\nI guess I just think that there are times when\nREST is incompatible with your needs, but MIME-RPC\nhelps you.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
