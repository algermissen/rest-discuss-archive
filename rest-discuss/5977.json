This is typically not the case. A back-end database\n&gt; has a schema with possibly very little resource-dicated structure.\n&gt; Resources represent subsets of the data stored in that schema, but the\n&gt; set of resources and the database schema should be free to change and\n&gt; evolve indepdendently.\n&gt;\nI want to second this. A REST proponent recently recommended to me  \nthat I base my access control on URIs, whereas I am more inclined to  \nassociate access control with database entities. Even though I&#39;m  \nbuilding a web application, and even though HTTP is a really great  \nprotocol, the web and HTTP are not the end of history. Some day other  \ntechnologies will come along and I&#39;ll want to serve up our content in  \nnew ways. An article is a database entity, therefore, and the URI of  \nthat article (the article &quot;resource&quot;) is *mapped* to the entity. HTTP  \nis one way of accessing and interacting with our database entities. I  \nbelieve the way to use REST in design is when you are looking at your  \nweb application from the client&#39;s perspective. From the outside, how  \ndoes the application behave? Does the back button work properly? How  \nwell can the application leverage HTTP caching?\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nEditor-in-Chief\nArtima Developer\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n"}}
