It&#39;s not entirely clear to my why it&#39;s desirable in the \n&gt;general case (why does it matter?).\n&gt;\n\nIt matters because there is another resource involved whether one \nacknowledges its presence by assigning it a URI, or not.  It does not matter \nto a user-agent, it matters to the definition of content negotiation.  When \na resource is negotiated, it is not a box of apples containing a Red \nDelicious apple and a Golden Delicious apple.  It is a box of apples which \nhas been divided into one container (bin) for Red Delicious apples and \nanother container for Golden Delicious apples.  To dereference an apple one \nis reaching into a box of apples, yes, but one is reaching into one bin or \nthe other, and those bins (boxes) should be identified with URIs in a REST \nsystem simply because they&#39;re resources.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;How is that relevant to the client? Also, what&#39;s the definition of an \n&gt;&quot;endpoint&quot;?\n&gt;\n\nNot sure where I said any of this is relevant to the client?  The semantics \nof the mapping for a REST resource is static, as can be shown using basic set \ntheory and simple two-circle Venn diagrams. When the semantics of the mapping \nfor a resource can&#39;t be defined in such fashion, I say that makes it non-\nstatic and hence, an endpoint.\n\n-Eric\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Best regards, Julian\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
