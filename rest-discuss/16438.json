REST, as I understand, is a style. You can build it with whatever\n&gt; you want. We need to apply the &quot;practicality&quot; principle (do things in\n&gt; a practical way) and avoid the Golden Hammer Syndrome. \n&gt; \n\nNo, you can&#39;t build whatever you want with REST.  There are problem\nareas out there for which REST is not a solution.  REST is what it is,\nnot what it isn&#39;t.  Where REST is impractical, the advice here always\ncomes down to, &quot;then don&#39;t use it.&quot;\n\n&gt; \n&gt; 4. REST is free to be used privately, or so I feel it. Only a few\n&gt; guys and me. There is nothing I can find that forces me to use the\n&gt; WEB in general and to take into account all and each of the nodes\n&gt; that are connected to it. \n&gt; \n\nNobody has ever maintained otherwise.  But, if you&#39;re sending HTTP over\nthe Internet, well, that&#39;s the definition of the Web.  If you don&#39;t care\nabout anyone else re-using your system, then why bother with REST?  If\nyou do care, then you can&#39;t ignore all those other nodes out there,\nbecause REST is all *about* those other nodes out there.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 5. Not all is written, yet. It is not true the current &quot;standards&quot;,\n&gt; official or ad hoc, are the only ones that will ever be, no new kids\n&gt; allowed.\n&gt; \n\nNobody has ever maintained otherwise.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 6. If I use the web, doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m entering the big and only one\n&gt; networked application, that I should agree with all the existing\n&gt; nodes in the web the way I send my messages (and the ones that will\n&gt; be in the future too!).\n&gt;\n\nNobody has ever maintained otherwise.  But, you cannot achieve the goals\nof REST without self-descriptive messaging.  Which, on the Web, means\nagreeing to use IANA-registered standard media type identifiers.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; And here (as with everything else) I can be wrong: I see the web more\n&gt; as a framework, a supporting implementation for trillions of\n&gt; networked, individual apps.\n&gt;\n\nOnly a small subset of which may be considered RESTful.  Being RESTful\nis neither a requirement for, nor a result of, using the Web.  Nor is\nusing the Web a requirement of REST.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; There I can use others services, create my own, be a global provider\n&gt; or simply build a small page for my family to see mi baby&#39;s pictures.\n&gt; I see no practical use to have a full body of standards watching over\n&gt; me and punishing if I post the pictures using my own, non-patent, 4D\n&gt; format.\n&gt;\n\nNo standards body is going to punish you for this, nor is there any Web\nrequirement to use IANA-registered standard media types.  You simply\nwon&#39;t achieve the goals of REST this way, because you&#39;re violating the\nself-descriptive messaging constraint.\n\nIf the beneficial effects of self-descriptive messaging aren&#39;t required\nby your system, then why bother with a style that requires it?  If the\ngoals of your system are incongruous with the goals of REST, then just\ndon&#39;t use REST -- there&#39;s nothing wrong with that!\n\nJust don&#39;t point to such a system and insist that it&#39;s REST, then\nrespond to criticism by saying that REST is &quot;just a style&quot; and\ntherefore its constraints may be freely ignored... because that&#39;s NOT\nREST.  REST is design-by-constraint, not unbounded creativity.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; 7. Example? We work on a testing system that builds thousands of\n&gt; nodes, for a few minutes, to load test servers. That is a network of\n&gt; testing nodes, on the cloud, talking between them with proprietary,\n&gt; efficient formats.\n&gt;\n\nIf the system&#39;s goals are incongruous to REST, then don&#39;t use REST.\nIt is not a requirement of using the Web, that you implement the\nconstraints of REST.\n\nIt *IS* a requirement of REST that your messaging be self-descriptive,\nwhich, on the Web, means IANA-registered standard types *are* required.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Once all that info is gathered, it is served in standard formats to\n&gt; clients. That is practical. RESTful? May be, but who cares? It is\n&gt; working and working fine.\n&gt; \n\nI certainly don&#39;t care.  I don&#39;t know how folks get confused on this\npoint.  There is no best architectural style, only the architectural\nstyle that&#39;s best for your system.  If your goals are incongruous with\nthe goals of REST, then REST is clearly inappropriate to your needs.\n\nThe only thing anyone here cares about is that the term REST be reserved\nfor systems that actually follow the REST style -- which does NOT\ninclude HTTP-over-the-Internet systems which ignore the IANA registry,\nor use registered types that aren&#39;t actually standards.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
