The problem I&#39;m describing is that users would have \n&gt; to authenticate at the root of the visible hierarchy, so that pages \n&gt; which are still accessible but which look different can know the auth \n&gt; info.  For pages where authentication is optional that makes no sense.\n\nthis is a different problem that has already benn discussed here. If the\npasge is accessible to everybody, but look different for each user, this\nis not an authentication problem, but a personnalisation or\ncustomization, which is not the purpose of http auth.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
