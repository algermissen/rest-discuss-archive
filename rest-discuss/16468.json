I&#39;ve asked\n&gt; this question before and I&#39;m not sure I got an answer.\n&gt;\n\nActually, I think I attempted it but got it wrong...\n\nSelf-descriptiveness was met with Atom (on the Web, i.e. HTTP over the\nInternet) the second its first media type identifier was approved by\nIANA, because it pointed to an IETF-sanctioned standardization process\nfrom the get-go.\n\nToken of admittance in hand, Atom entered the &quot;gray area&quot; and is now as\nRESTful as anything else due to its ubiquity.  Initially, though, Atom\nwasn&#39;t &quot;in browsers&quot; or in server-side CMS software like WP, or allowed\nto pass PUT and DELETE traffic through most firewalls.\n\nThis ubiquity is what allows the network effects of serendipitous re-\nuse and anarchic scalability.  There&#39;s no guarantee your opaque\nidentifier will be allowed to pass PUT and DELETE traffic through\nfirewalls, when Atom had to evolve this ability through the adoption of\nAtom Protocol, and even HTML and Atom aren&#39;t guaranteed passage?  The\ndegree of certainty is an order of magnitude higher for ubiquitous\ntypes, though.\n\nBut, this isn&#39;t a FUD argument.  Consider the practical matter of DNS\nlookahead caching -- Google did that study last year where they\nintroduced 1/10th sec. latency to some transactions, and calculated the\ncost to their bottom line.  Which led them to release their own desktop\nDNS accelerator.\n\nThis product type relies on ubiquitous identifiers which re-use\nstandard methods and link relations, to determine which links to ignore.\nHow can such a product be expected to know what a &quot;link&quot; is, or what\nmethod it may relate to, (or how to handle fragments, for other types\nof intermediary), or whether it&#39;s just an identifier, or resolve\nrelative URIs if it doesn&#39;t know the local lingo for a base URI?\n\nNow that it&#39;s out there, DNS lookup acceleration technology is yet\nanother serendipitous re-use of ubiquitous media types, leading to even\ngreater anarchic scalability on today&#39;s Web than existed a decade ago.\nHow does that technology work, if it can&#39;t determine what a link is, or\nwhether or not the data type uses standard link relations, because the\nidentifier you&#39;re sending isn&#39;t both registered and ubiquitous?\n\nUsing ubiquitous identifiers on the Web taps your system into that\ndeployed architecture, decreasing overall latency for end-users,\nespecially for systems spanning (sub)domains.  Some of those systems\nmay sniff your content and decide it&#39;s just like HTML anyway, but you\ncan&#39;t bank on that like you can on re-using ubiquitous types.\n\nIf and when a new standard comes along which fills a large enough need\nthat it&#39;s widely and quickly adopted, its RESTfulness will increase as\nits recognition by the deployed Web architecture increases, which is\nanarchic and serendipitous.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
