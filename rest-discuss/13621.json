My point was not to say URI \ntemplates are better than forms.\n\nMy point was that transmitting a &quot;form&quot; (quotes) is usually not useful \nto a machine-based client as the &quot;discovery&quot; phase happened when the \nprogrammer coded the client.\n\nPersonally, I don&#39;t like the &lt;link&gt; or Link header format.  IMO it \nshould be something like:\n\n&lt;link name=&quot;...&quot; description=&quot;http:/...&quot; href=&quot;http://...&quot; type=&quot;&quot;/&gt;\n\nWith description being an explicit URL.  The client could ask for a \nspecific rendering media type.  In the current format (correct me if I&#39;m \nwrong)  it seems like the &quot;rel&quot; attribute is overloaded.\n\nSolomon Duskis wrote:\n&gt; Sure, HTML forms are usually entered by a human, but there&#39;s nothing \n&gt; inherently part of the &lt;form&gt; elements that I selected that requires \n&gt; human intervention. I do concede that HTML elements include &quot;checkbox&quot; \n&gt; and &quot;radiobutton&quot;, but those don&#39;t have to be used in a &lt;form&gt; element \n&gt; meant for machine usage.  It wouldn&#39;t be all that difficult to come up \n&gt; with a set of &lt;form&gt; elements that would be better suited for machine \n&gt; interactions \n&gt; \n&gt; The main point in favor of HTML forms:\n&gt; \n&gt;     * The server wants a specific ACTION (rather than a document\n&gt;       relationship)\n&gt;     * The server expects a specific HTTP METHOD (rather than using out\n&gt;       of band information to guess the method)\n&gt;     * The server gives a NAME for the action (rather than a relationship\n&gt;       type for the action)\n&gt;     * The server gives a DETAILED BREAKDOWN of what it expects,\n&gt;       potentially including constraints\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The main detractions of &lt;link&gt; + &quot;rel&quot;:\n&gt; \n&gt;     * ATOM&#39;s &lt;link&gt; generally indicates a relationship between\n&gt;       documents.  rest-discuss has tried to overcome quite a few issues\n&gt;       related to ACTIONS.\n&gt;     * rel stands for relationship, right?  &quot;rel&quot; would have to define\n&gt;       how a universal ACTION like CustomersByZip relates to the current\n&gt;       document, not what the action is\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not going to give up on this issue.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Solomon\n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, Oct 2, 2009 at 9:48 AM, Bill Burke &lt;bburke@... \n&gt; &lt;mailto:bburke@...&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     Solomon Duskis wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;         Using link doesn&#39;t seem all that natural to me.

Machine based clients are already going to know how to\n&gt;     fill out the &quot;form&quot; ahead of time so the rendering information isn&#39;t\n&gt;     needed when transmitting representations.  Only the link (or link\n&gt;     template) is interesting to a machine based client.\n&gt; \n&gt;     I don&#39;t know what the convention is, but links can and do provide\n&gt;     URLs for their description.  That description URL, is, IMO the\n&gt;     appropriate place for &quot;form&quot; metadata.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Well, at least, that is my theory on how things might or should work....\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     -- \n&gt;     Bill Burke\n&gt;     JBoss, a division of Red Hat\n&gt;     http://bill.burkecentral.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
