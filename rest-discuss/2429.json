For instance, you may have an online document which\nshow\n&gt; &gt;in English for uri1 and French for uri2.  Same resource, different\n&gt; &gt;representations.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Your mistake is thinking that the document is the resource.  In this\n&gt; case, it is not.  Using your scheme, the resource identified by uri1 is\n&gt; &#39;the document rendered in English&#39;.  The resource identified by uri2 is\n&gt; &#39;the document rendered in French&#39;.\n\nOkay, change it from &quot;an online document&quot; to &quot;a resource&quot;.  I think the\nexample was perfectly valid.  Of course, it was pointed out that this\nparticular example gets into the issue of the &quot;Accept-Language&quot;.  The point\nI was making was that it&#39;s perfectly legitimate to have a single resource\nthat returns different representations (where only the entity is different).\nTherefore, you could not depend on content-type, content-length, or the\nentity body itself  (or any combination of them) to confidently state\nwhether two URIs point to the same resource or not.\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
