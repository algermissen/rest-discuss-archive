This has nothing to do with\n&gt; dereferencing algorithm=\r\ns.\n\nCould you highlight where the specification, which allows delegation of=\r\n semantics of reserved characters to the dereferencing algorithms, talks ab=\r\nout syntax?\n\n&gt; Actually, if a person decides to have &quot;http://server/[{ident=\r\nifier}]&quot; as\n&gt; a URI (and here I presume that &quot;valid delimited url&quot; [sic] me=\r\nans a URI),\n\nAgain, the rfc mention that those reserved characters MAY be u=\r\nsed as delimiters, either by the dereferencing algorithm or the scheme. I w=\r\non&#39;t get into the debate of http uris used as urls or urns, so will give yo=\r\nu that one. For your other points, excpt for you highlighting the rfc &quot;rese=\r\nrves&quot; delimiters that are not used in http, I don&#39;t see where your point is=\r\n? I&#39;d really like for you to expand on your claims.\n\nAre you considering th=\r\nat the dereferencing algorithm is *not* a subordinate of the scheme, and th=\r\nat as such any reserved character in URIs that is not used by the scheme ha=\r\nve to stay reserved for some reason I missed?\n\nS\n\n\n\n"}}
