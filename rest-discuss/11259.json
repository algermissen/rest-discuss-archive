Such as I have a Product which manages various customer accounts and I have a URL such as, http://localhost:6060/api/customers which lists all the customers. Now I have a customer named ABC, then I have to add a URL http://localhost:6060/api/customer/ABC to detail all information about the customer and to do more operations like Edit, activate, etc., with the customer by accessing all traffic to http://localhost:6060/api/customer/ABC to my webservice.php which is available under http://localhost:6060/api/, \n\nI believe this is doable, but don&#39;t exactly know how. If anybody can point me to a document on the above, it will be great.\n\nThanks for all your help,\n\nRegards,\nJayavasanthan J\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
