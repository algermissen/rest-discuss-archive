Just because the resource accepted a\nparticular\nset of data last week does not mean that it will this week.\n\nThe equivalent in HTML is to GET the form, fill in the fields and then POST\nthe data to\nthe URL identified in the form. If the fields have changed then the user\nwill adjust their\ninput accordingly.\n\nWhen implementing a REST style Web Service, the application should GET the\nform,\nconstruct an appropriate entity body (XML or whatever else) and POST the\nentity body\nto the URL identified in the form. In this case the form is a RDF form (or\nperhaps a\nmicroformat). It should not do a &quot;blind&quot; POST to the resource.\n\nIs this the point you are trying to make?\n\nDonald.\n\n\n\n                                                                           \n                                                                           \n                                                                           \n                                                                           \n\n\n\n\n\nOn Nov 29, 2005, at 8:05 PM, Matt Garland wrote:\n\n&gt; The only expectation I see is that POST will return some kind of\n&gt; response correlated to the request.\n\n&#39;correlated to the request&#39; means &#39;correlated to *the intent* of the\nrequest&#39;, right?\nThe problem is that HTTP provides no means to communicate to the\nserver any such intent (extended semantics beyond &#39;process this&#39;).\nAll you can expect is that the server will return some kind of\nresponse correlated to your request to just process you data.\n\nIf you successfully POSTed an order to some Web resource a while ago\nand today want to POST another one, do you\n\n- POST again to the same resource because you bookmarked it from last\ntime\n\nor\n\n- go to the site again, step through the application along the\nhyperlinks you will be given *today* until you are guided to the\nplace to POST to *this time*?\n\nThe Web application has to tell you (or the non-human client\ncomponent) at runtime where to send your data instead you you making\nassumptions about the nature of a resoource beyond the semantics od\nthe uniform API.\n\nIt is this denial of assumptions of a client about a resource that\nmakes it possible for the resources to evolve without breaking\nassumptions.\n\nHTH\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n&gt; That expectation would be met by\n&gt; any web server, providing substitutability. All of the other client\n&gt; expectations appear to be resting squarely on the status code and\n&gt; Content-Type provided by the server.\n&gt;\n&gt; The phrase I emphasized seems to imply that there is no correlation at\n&gt; all between the request and the response, while RFC 2616 indicates\n&gt; that the 200 response to a POST means the response body is &quot;an entity\n&gt; describing or containing the result of the action&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; I do suppose there&#39;s nothing in that statement that indicates the\n&gt; action triggered by a POST request has anything to do with the POST\n&gt; request&#39;s body; is that what you&#39;re getting at?\n&gt;\n&gt; C: POST /foo/portfolios/\n&gt; C: Content-Type: application/portfolio\n&gt; C: ...portfolio...\n&gt;\n&gt; S: 201 Created\n&gt; S: Location: http://example.com/foo/portfolios/42\n&gt;\n&gt; Does the value of the Location header in that response have any\n&gt; relationship at all to the portfolio in the body of the POST request?\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n_______________\nJan Algermissen, Consultant & Programmer\nhttp://jalgermissen.com\nTugboat Consulting, &#39;Applying Web technology to enterprise IT&#39;\nhttp://www.tugboat.de\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
