Of course someone might argue that because the content on \nthe\n: different pages is so similar I should not create different resources; I\n: should only have one. But I think that would be being pedantic in trying \nto\n: optimize the caching benefit in exchange to the detriment of usability.\n\nSeparation Of Concerns suggests that your sites (and your life) will\nbe simpler if you decouple the thing you are seeking from the conversation\nyou had along the way.  That&#39;s not being pedantic either.\n\nWalden \n\n\n"}}
