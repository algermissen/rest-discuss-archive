Please clarify...\n&gt; \n&gt; Clarification: the question mark means I&#39;m guessing. I&#39;m not\n&gt; referring to anything existing like the APP (which I haven&#39;t delved\n&gt; deeply into just yet), just the general case for MOVE.\n&gt; \n&gt; Entry is a resource, part of entry&#39;s representation includes the\n&gt; feed&#39;s identification. Server gets the entry PUT back to it, sees that\n&gt; the difference is the feed, and so it moves it. Internally it may be\n&gt; nothing like just changing a &quot;feed&quot; field in an &quot;entries&quot; table, but\n&gt; as far as the client is concerned, that&#39;s what you want to change\n&gt; about the resource, so that&#39;s what it looks like.\n&gt; \n&gt; There&#39;s other ways to move things that still don&#39;t require a MOVE\n&gt; action to be created. If all else fails, DELETE from the old, POST to\n&gt; the new.\n\nWell, there are a few problems with that.\n\n1) AFAICT, there is no feed information in the entry. Thus, APP would \nneed to add that. Too late.\n\n2) Even if it were there, APP would need to define what it means to edit \nit for clients to be able to rely on it.\n\n3) And even then, it&#39;s not really clear how this would work for entries \nthat are supposed to appear in multiple feeds.\n\nSo you&#39;d end up with lots of additional specification text to define a \nfunctionality that is already defined in a separate related standards \ntrack IETF spec.\n\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n"}}
