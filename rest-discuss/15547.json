We have chose=\r\nn to treat a list as a collection of row elements.  A browser-based client =\r\nwill support editing of the list in a tabular view.  In addition to adding =\r\nand removing entire rows, users will also be able to edit individual fields=\r\n within a row.  We would like to support a Save button that saves all chang=\r\nes (possibly across multiple rows) on the current screen in one http reques=\r\nt.\n\nOur current thinking is that we would send back a collection containing=\r\n only the rows to be updated (or inserted/deleted). However (without gettin=\r\ng down into the details) the back-end will need to be able to determine whe=\r\nther individual fields in each row actually need to be updated, so there is=\r\n some question as to how to represent whether or not an individual field ha=\r\ns been changed.  We would like to use the same document type both for getti=\r\nng the list entries and posting changes back to the list. \n\nDoes anyone hav=\r\ne any pointers to some examples of MIME types or application protocols that=\r\n support this sort of model? \n\n--Chuck\n\n\n"}}
