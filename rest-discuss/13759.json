The root URI of a system publishes a set of\n&gt; links that applications can follow at runtime.  This sounds very\n&gt; similar to a &quot;Naming Service&quot; and it solves similar problems, but it\n&gt; is different in that the services themselves act as the mechanism for\n&gt; service registration.  Things become much more dynamic and decoupled.\n&gt; Services can change, on the fly, which other services the client is\n&gt; routed to.\n&gt;\n\n&gt; Links allow your URIs to become totally opaque as well.  That way you\n&gt; can redesign your URL schemes as your application evolves and not\n&gt; worry as much about breaking clients.\n&gt;\n&gt; Links are also somewhat self describing.  Like a schema URL in an XML\n&gt; document Links also define where you can find out information on how\n&gt; to interact with them.\nLinks, yes. The problem is which one is the Root URI in a distributed\nset of REST services? Sounds like a centralized Naming service again,\neach Service registering itself into The_Root_URI. Am I missing something?\n\nBest regards,\nNina\n\n"}}
