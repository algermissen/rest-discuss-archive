If not, it might worth looki=\r\nng at the previous discussions there, as a lot of the different use cases a=\r\nnd needs are mentioned there. The JSON referencing mechanism that we use in=\r\n Dojo does indeed lack extensibility, but I think we had made significant e=\r\nffort towards a more extensible mechanism for hyperlinking in JSON with a m=\r\neta-specification that uses JSON Schema to define hyperlink structures [2] =\r\n(and provides a superset of the capabilities of Subbu&#39;s proposal as well. D=\r\niscussions on restful-json have cooled off lately, but I&#39;d be glad to conti=\r\nnue working on evolving a JSON hyperlinking mechanism, as I think we have a=\r\n good foundation now.\n\n\n[1] http://groups.google.com/group/restful-json\n\n[2=\r\n] http://groups.google.com/group/restful-json/browse_thread/thread/cf4b0bd4=\r\n44f5fd83\n\nThanks,\nKris\n\n\n"}}
