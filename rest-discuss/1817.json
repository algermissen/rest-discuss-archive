It seems a fundamental feature\n&gt; &gt; of the generic interface that a client can request events with GET, as\n&gt; &gt; long as those events stop when the connection drops.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, but if the events are themselves requests you are tunnelling http in \n&gt; http.  If that&#39;s not evil I wnat to know why not.\n\nIt is, but event notifications received on a GET aren&#39;t requests,\nthey&#39;re responses.  There&#39;s no tunneling going on.\n\n&gt; As always, I really really object to adding new methods.  There&#39;s a reason \n&gt; why I want to go _below_ HTTP to make mods like this.\n\n[snip]\n\n&gt; You have to specify it as a new protocol because it would break existing\n&gt; implementations.  However I read the spec fairly carefully to find\n&gt; anything about this new protocol that was in conflict and found absolutely\n&gt; nothing.  The RFC requires nothing at at the transport layer.\n\n[snip]\n\n&gt; My working plan is to use the HTTP Upgrade: response header with a value\n&gt; for the new protocol of &quot;AC-HTTP&quot;.  &quot;AC&quot; meaning &quot;alternating current.&quot;\n\nThose 3 paragraphs above seem contradictory to me.  In the last one,\nyou say that you&#39;re using the Upgrade header, and naming it akin to\nHTTP, both which suggest that your protocol is an application protocol.\nYet your first and second paragraphs suggest that it&#39;s below an\napplication protocol.\n\nIf by &quot;Upgrade&quot; header, you were referring to your AC-HTTP, and\nusing its upgrade mechanism to upgrade to HTTP, then I think we&#39;re in\nsynch - at least I understand what you&#39;re suggesting.  But it doesn&#39;t\nseem so.\n\nAnyhow, I believe that the application protocol idea is the right\napproach, and also this protocol should be an HTTP extension.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
