Or it should, or it\ncan, be applied to the more general space of network-based software\narchitectures, thus including intranets (network based apps that runs\nexclusively inside a company) and extranets (the use of private\nnetworks and/or the public infrastructure of the internet to connect a\nlimited number of companies - considering limited does not equal\nsmall)?\n\nBecause if it is indeed only applicable to the Web - and please note\nthat Web != Internet - to making websites that are going to be used by\nhumans using a browser, most of the discussions here don&#39;t really make\nsense. Otherwise, some people assumptions when they deal with the\nissues presented on this list are, to say the least, limited. Or plain\nwrong, not to say the least. Now I do understand that one or the other\napproach may have to do with each one background, people who&#39;s work is\nlimited to the web may have a different point of view than others who\nworked over several areas and platforms along the years.\n\nFor instance, what is the sense in saying &quot;Media type identifers\ninform clients what codec or engine to use for deciphering the\npayload&quot; if my clients are *not* browsers? And also please someone\ncorrect if I&#39;m wrong by saying &quot;ubiquitous&quot; != &quot;standard&quot;...\n\nWhile it is true that intermediaries don&#39;t look inside the msg to\nperform their function, why is that true also for servers that are not\nweb-servers? If I have a application/mystuff+xml, all the\nintermediaries understand what they need to understand - they read\nthis as application/xml. Why should the server be limited to this,\nknowing that I, as a architect/designer, although I  *do not* have\ncontrol on intermediaries I *do* have control over the server? The\ncoupling using application/xml or application/mystuff+xml is, from\nthis point of view, exactly the same. And I do see advantage of using\n&quot;application/mystuff+xml&quot; on content-negociation *on the server side*,\nbecause like that I can even put that content-negociation on my\n*server-side connector* - which I also control, thus relieving the\nserver from workload, improving balancing, implementing scalability\nand effectively implementing layered design - but of course all this\nis just impelementation.\n\nAlso, and all please excuse my rant but these things must be said...\nwhy some people on this list insist in treating people sometimes like\nmorons and sometimes like little kids in the classroom in front of the\nmaster? Shouldn&#39;t we all consider the others as pairs, even if the\nknowledge of some are superior to the one of others? Aren&#39;t we all\nprofessionals? What&#39;s the &quot;you kids&quot;? I&#39;m trying not to say harsh\nwords, but do I have to publicize that I develop software for the past\n30 years, 27 of then as a professional, 20 of then as a independent\nconsultant / contractor? That I started to do web sites since the\nearlier 90&#39;s and I kept working on the web (although not exclusively)\nuntil as recently as 2007, when I designed and implemented a web-site\nlogin method using telephony - where you had to call a number to be\nauthorized to enter the site and you will be logged in until you hang\nup the call. Should I also say that I did a web site to a chicken\ndelivery service - I didn&#39;t put that on my CV since I made it to a\nfriend and it was not a paid job - or actually it was, I got paid in\nchickens... I even designed myself many animated gif&#39;s... How&#39;s that\nfor publicity? I don&#39;t know, maybe it&#39;s just me that dislike being\ntreated with this kind of disdain?\n\nNevertheless, I really think that this list should clarify the\nquestion I talked above, because frankly if REST is only about the\nweb, I am plain wrong in my approach and it is better for me to\nunderstand that now and move on to other technologies. And I think\nothers will benefit from that clarification also.\n\n\n\nOn 12 August 2010 07:19, Eric J.

Clients are limited by how\n&gt; recent their codec/engine is for the given type, or how fully they\n&gt; implement that type. Media type identifiers are _not_ meant to say\n&gt; anything about the nature of the payload. Doing so would introduce\n&gt; coupling, violating the layered-system constraint, and result in more\n&gt; media types than anyone could possibly keep up with, defeating the\n&gt; whole purpose of self-descriptive messaging.\n&gt;\n\n"}}
