If so, what would the dialogue look like,\n&gt; would it involve a 302 or a 417 response, and can you even have a\n&gt; Location header with a 417 response?\n\nI would think so. The server would immediately send the 302 with the \nLocation header.\n\nOne related problem is that the Java servlet API doesn&#39;t really allow \nservlet based servers to do the right thing here. It would be really \nnice if there&#39;d be some progress on that. \n(&lt;http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4812000&gt;).\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n"}}
