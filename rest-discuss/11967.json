So I’ll take an English translation of a French page,\n&gt; &gt; but if it is available in both English and German I want either\n&gt; &gt; English or German depending on which one is the original version.\n&gt;\n&gt; This isn&#39;t a choice of language per se, it&#39;s a choice of original\n&gt; version over translation.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;en&quot; is a choice of language, &quot;original version&quot; is not.\n\nSo where’s the conneg header that lets me pick original vs\ntranslation? If there isn’t one, the effect is the same – there\nare too few variables going into conneg.\n\n&gt; &gt; At other times the different language versions differ\n&gt; &gt; significantly, even though they inform about roughly the same\n&gt; &gt; things, in which case I might want to look at several of\n&gt; &gt; them.\n&gt;\n&gt; Reading several translations of something is a different task\n&gt; to reading something without thinking or caring about whether\n&gt; or not it has other translations out there. As a different task\n&gt; for the user, it has different requirements for the tech.\n\nI may want to perform either task on the same set of documents at\nvarious times, so the server must be capable of accommodating\nboth cases. So as far as I can tell, my point stands.\n\n&gt; &gt; Also, if I hit the conference WLAN in Denmark I don’t want to\n&gt; &gt; have to fight to get Google in something other than Danish.\n&gt;\n&gt; The problem with Google is that while it does language con-neg\n&gt; it does Geo IP first.\n\nI know. I picked that as a general example of server-driven\nlangauge choice. In fact I bet that what Google does works better\nfor a majority of users than relying on language conneg would,\nsince the latter requires digging around several layers deep in\nthe preferences of the browser, so most people never find it and\nmost of those who do don’t know that it sometimes actually has an\neffect and what that effect is, and hence won’t touch it anyway.\n\n(As with many of the more advanced features of HTTP, UA UI is the\nbiggest reason they’re not getting traction.)\n\nEither way, the effect of Geo IP is much the same as conneg: it\nis usually a pain to work around if the server makes the wrong\nchoice on your behalf. And that’s the point I was getting at.\n\n&gt; &gt; Make the different language versions easily, cleanly\n&gt; &gt; addressable and stick a bunch of flag icons on your page,\n&gt; &gt; then call it a day.\n&gt;\n&gt; The mapping between flags and languages harmless in some cases,\n&gt; but in other debated with AK-47s, pipe bombs the torturing of\n&gt; people imprisoned without trial and so on. In this regard at\n&gt; least, it doesn&#39;t scale.\n\nRight, please disregard the flags part, which was a half-baked\nafterthought. (Use textual links, as Leonard proposed.) I stand\nby the rest.\n\nAll of your charges are valid insofar as my argument wasn’t\nparticularly solidly constructed, but I stand by my overall\nthrust that language conneg as per RFC 2616 is a complicated but\ninsufficient solution to a non-problem that is actually a feature\nwith many advantages.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
