If I created a\n&gt; resource &#92;ordershipper and POST&#39;d a document to it, what would make that\n&gt; any more of a resource?\n\n\nIt&#39;s anything that your implementation cares or depends on; and that\ndepends on the context.\n\nLet&#39;s apply this to your lightswitch example in another email. Imagine\nif there are thousands of lightswitch, each controlling a pixel in a\nLED message board[1]. There is a software running on the board that\nwill take in a text and figures out which switches to toggle so as to\ndisplay the text on the board.\n\nTo the board software, the lightswitches are important resources.\n\nBut on a highway, there are many many such boards. All those boards\nare centrally managed by a controller software. The operator of the\ncontroller decides what text gets to send to which board.\n\nThe controller software shouldn&#39;t care about the lightswitches within\nthe boards. To it, the boards are the resources and there is no need\nto know the status of the individual lightswitches.\n\nIn fact, for the sake of genericism, it should not know that there are\nlightswitches at all. It still has to work with a board using a\ntechnology that can display some text without toggling any\nlightswitches.\n\n\nYS.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes: \n[1]  http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/wz/technologies/michigan/images/figure3.jpg Original document: http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/wz/technologies/michigan/index.htm\n\n\n\n\n"}}
