But just  \n&gt; saying &#39;use prose&#39; does not address 3. above. This was one of the  \n&gt; points made by Steve Jones: given that WS-* has a rigid interface  \n&gt; description language &#39;built in&#39; while the use of REST means you have  \n&gt; to come up with a means of describing interfaces yourself is a huge  \n&gt; selling point for WS-*. Not that having such things as WSDL and BPEL  \n&gt; is desireable from a networked systems point of view but when a non  \n&gt; technical person has to make a business decision about WS-* vs REST,  \n&gt; the latter is more likely to &#39;loose&#39; if you first have to come up  \n&gt; with a style for documenting the interfaces. And even worse would be  \n&gt; the position of &#39;Nah, you don&#39;t need that. Just let everyone write  \n&gt; it up&#39;.\n\n\nSorry, but I think it is a flawed assertion to say that &quot;WS-* has a  \nrigid interface description language &#39;built in&#39;&quot; which somehow makes  \nit better. Just because it has been sold like that does not make it  \ntrue. I would love to see a developer who wrote a client application  \nby just looking at the WSDL, or a business person who was not asked  a  \nsingle clarification about some operation or a field is supposed to  \nwork.\n\nSubbu\n\n"}}
