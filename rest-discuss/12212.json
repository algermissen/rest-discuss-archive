Historically, it seems to me that \nindustry was geared more towards providing proprietary, black box, \natomic solutions and tooling. An environment where interoperability is \nconstrained purposefully by stake-holders&#39; natural desire to control \nsupply (propreitary standards), and demand (controlling/owning state). \nAs I understand it, a lot of the properties of RESTful architecture \nactually play against the forces of this desired environment quite \ndirectly - decentralisation existing as the apparent antithesis of value \ncreation.\nI actually believe this process to have been a necessary part of an \non-going evolution, where concentrations of value provided the fuel and \ncombustion required to &#39;build up speed&#39;.\n\nNow; it seems that a combination of the information age, the semantic \nweb, and open source/standards are breaking barriers and ecouraging new \nbusiness approaches to building distributed systems - spurred on by the \ncurrent and future state of the world economy, no doubt.\n\nSo (to me anyway!) it appears the controlling factors have been more \neconomic, political, and social, than directly technical.\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n&gt; I&#39;ll just say that of all the REST constraints, the statelessness one\n&gt; is the least well understood.  Cookies and URL rewriting and similar\n&gt; approaches are not necessarily violations of REST, nor are they bad\n&gt; decisions.  If you read the text closely, it talks about statelessness\n&gt; as being the easiest to build from the server perspective, which is\n&gt; obviously true.  But &#39;ease of building&#39; is by no means the only\n&gt; criteria for evaluating one part of a system.\n&gt;\n&gt; There are a large number of very scalable and performant web sites\n&gt; that retain state on the server.  If you want a very high performant\n&gt; web site, you have to move a bunch of state into a cache of some kind,\n&gt; beit memcached, APC, or any of the many other solutions.  You then\n&gt; have to tie the client into a server that holds the client&#39;s cached\n&gt; state.  These systems are definitely more complicated than a stateless\n&gt; web server, but it&#39;s all about making trade-offs in building\n&gt; distributed systems.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Dave\n&gt;   \n\n"}}
