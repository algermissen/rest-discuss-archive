To compare, if I were to document REST as it is\n&gt; done today, I&#39;d probably ignore HTTP PUT/DELETE and I&#39;d say that GET/POST\n&gt; can be used interchangeably except for some bookmarking applications where\n&gt; GET is a little better.  \n\nThat&#39;s a severe misrepresentation of the way the Web is used today. GET\nis used whenever safe references are important. Bookmarking is a tiny\nexample. I can send you this link because of GET:\n\nhttp://search.bea.com/query.html?qt=REST\n\nI didn&#39;t bookmark it and probably you won&#39;t either. That fact that I can\nemail it to you -- communicate it to you -- is what is important. You\ncan interoperably, using any Web client, anywhere in the world,\ndereference that link. Bookmarking is a side effect of that general\nimprovement in interoperability. I am confident that BEA&#39;s web designers\nunderstand this issue because they work with these safe information\nreferences (&quot;hyperlinks&quot;) all day.\n\n&gt; ... And I&#39;d say that CGIs are great.  \n\nCGIs *can be* great. I may be wrong, but I think that you&#39;re\ninterpreting something from this mail by Roy Fielding. I&#39;ve seen this\npost misinterpreted (IMO) in other places so I&#39;m going to address it\nonce and for all.\n\n * http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2002Apr/0181.html\n\nNote the last sentence: &#39;The fact of the matter is that\nmost CGI scripts are not HTTP compliant.  Most CGI scripts, in fact,\nprovide interfaces to applications that suck. The &quot;G&quot; stands for\nGateway.\nWhat people should realize is not that &quot;CGI scripts should be banned&quot;,\nbut rather that if the CGI script is written such that it behaves\nlike a proper Web interface, then it won&#39;t suck.&#39;\n\nCGI is a *gateway* interface. You can either use it to just publish some\nfunctionality through a URL (tunnelling) or you can use it to build a\nproper gateway between your software and the Web: URIs for all\nresources, hyperlinks as the engine of application state, etc. Some of\nthe most REST-ful applications in the world are CGI and many of the\nleast are not.\n-- \nCome discuss XML and REST web services at:\n  Open Source Conference: July 22-26, 2002, conferences.oreillynet.com\n  Extreme Markup: Aug 4-9, 2002,  www.extrememarkup.com/extreme/\n\n"}}
