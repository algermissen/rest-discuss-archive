There\nare a few ways in.  If you&#39;re interested in the httpd project, start\nhere, any browser will do:\n\nhttp://charger.bisonsystems.net/\nhttp://charger-admin.bisonsystems.net/\n\nOr, you can jump into the project directly, but compatibility is\ncurrently limited to Firefox:\n\nhttp://charger.bisonsystems.net/xmltest/index.xht\n\nYeah, there&#39;s a button to push.  Sorry, I&#39;m working on Xforms capability\nin an unobtrusive fashion, but development of same is required to be\nobtrusive.\n\nNormally, I restrict all the internals stuff to localhost access, but\nfor this demo I&#39;ve created the charger-admin alias.  Don&#39;t worry, the\nwhole thing is read-only, so you can&#39;t do any damage.  (I hope...  :-)\n\nThe purpose is to demo a whole buncha stuff.  The only links that work\n(apart from the directory browser) are the ones in body content, and\nthe &#39;View&#39; menu (the button for which takes you back into the directory\nbrowser, btw), but the variants are under construction so there&#39;s\nnothing to see there at this time.\n\nDrilling down to individual posts, comment threads, and standalone\ncomments does work.  And, all from one XSLT stylesheet.  That&#39;s the\npart where the application logic and XHTML template are cached on the\nclient, and based entirely on standard elements and link relations.\nThe applicability of this, of course, goes far beyond the demo&#39;s nature\nas a weblog.\n\nSandbox API is next, after the /date service is finished (a simple REST\nservice to transform ISO 8601 date strings into human-readable form).\n\nAll further notes are there in the project.  Q&A taken here, on-topic\nto the RESTful nature of the design (and proposed design, as described\nby the Accept and Allow headers).  I haven&#39;t figured out what I want to\ndo with OPTIONS on this project, yet.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
