There is no guarantee that\n&gt;&gt;http://example.com/customer/2345 is the next unused resource name. I\n&gt;&gt;contend there is no way to _reliably_ determine what the next unused\n&gt;&gt;resource name is.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;There are large number of unused resources, what is your definition of \n&gt;&#39;next&#39;, and what is the significance of sequence for these resources?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&#39;next&#39; : next in the sequence.\n\nOften data modellers choose sequences without good reason.\nFor example 1: Slashdot users get the number numerically,\nindicating some kind of seniority.\nFor example 2: Bug databases love to use sequences as identifiers\nbecause it is an immediate way of noticing recent activity.\n\nWhat if we were modelling a position in a queue?\nResource &quot;http://example.com/queue/44&quot; has to wait less than\n&quot;http://example.com/queue/45&quot;. In this case sequential resource\nnames seems natural and non-sequential resource names seems\na little artificial although quite workable.\n\nI suppose non-contiguous sequential resource names are a possibility\nlike, http://example.com/something/20051008.132202.997783. Name\ncollisions are unlikely but sequencing errors are almost guaranteed,\nespecially when clients have unsynchronized clocks.\n\nIn general, (it seems to me), there are only two ways to manage\nresource naming for PUT.\n\n1) Some agreement on naming scheme between server and all clients.\n\n2) The server always names the new resource, and clients always PUT\nto some collection resource (or resource creation proxy) that provides\nthe final name.\n\nIn the above 2) is really a special case of 1). The only difference is that\nin 2) the server can unilaterally enforce the scheme.\n\n&gt;With PUT, the client could decide the URI to use & have an algorithm for \n&gt;determining some  (locally) unused URI - but it seems that you need some \n&gt;sort of sequencing or pre-approved set of URI. Perhaps the server could \n&gt;pre-allocate a large number of URI that satisfy the requirements & the \n&gt;client could GET that list. The client might be able to use a request header \n&gt;of &quot;if-none-match: *&quot; to prevent a collision.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
