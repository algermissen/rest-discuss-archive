It seems to me that, like generic\ninterfaces, the separation of naming and &quot;routing&quot; and client-local control\nof all interactions are essential features of the Web.  I need to think more\nabout it, though, if I&#39;m going to make a more compelling argument than\nanalogy to bang paths.\n\nNow, having said that, I&#39;m *all for* composition.  IMO, tho, compositional\nmetaphors need to leave the request originator in control of the whole\nend-to-end interaction.  I think this is essential for loose coupling,\nindependent development, etc.  All the stuff we&#39;ve come to know and love.\n\nOr, if intermediaries are to control interaction, they should have *full*\ncontrol of the interaction and this should be invisible to clients.  I&#39;ve\nlong wanted a mechanism by which the owner of, say, foo.com could &quot;mount up&quot;\nremote pieces of URI address space in his own space, ala:\n\nhttp://foo.com/\n  bar/ --&gt; http://bar.com\n  baz/ --&gt; http://baz.com\n\nFurther, if foo.com provided an interface by which bar.com and baz.com could\n&quot;register&quot; themselves in foo.com&#39;s space, then you&#39;d have some enabling\ntechnology that could help solve many problems, namely the &quot;publish from\nbehind the firewall&quot; problem.
