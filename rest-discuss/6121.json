HTTP clearly doesn&#39;t have state,\n&gt; the shopping basket model clearly could benefit from it (however defined),\n&gt; so is it that each application makes the boundaries, and simply uses HTTP\n&gt; where appropriate at the response stage?\n\nYes.\n\nHTTP couldn&#39;t hope to have answers to these questions so it leaves\nthem unanswered.
