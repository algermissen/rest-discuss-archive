ACLs are difficult to manage and open you\nup to all sorts of subtle security vulnerabilities. If you&#39;ve ever\nwritten code that uses ACLs, chances are you&#39;ve written code that\nis vulnerable to a Confused Deputy attack.\n\n&gt; If I am looking at a page with my January\n&gt; bank account history, I would like some way to\n&gt; navigate back to the main menu....\n\nThere are solutions to this, but first I&#39;ll point out that this\nissue doesn&#39;t apply to software programs.  &quot;Web services&quot; address\nprogram to program communication. Programs have a stack and a heap\nto help them keep track of what they&#39;ve got and what they&#39;re\ndoing. A program doesn&#39;t &quot;navigate back&quot;, it just dereferences a\nvariable.\n\nIt&#39;s also easy to implement &quot;navigate back&quot; from within a web\nbrowser interface to the application. The simplest answer is just:\n&quot;Use the &#39;back&#39; button to navigate &#39;back&#39;.&quot;. A step up from there\nis using frames. You can keep your main menu in a small frame\nalong the left or top of the screen. The main menu is then always\naccessible to the user. If you don&#39;t like frames, you can use XSLT\nto build a composite page on the server. The XSLT code can suck in\nXML from a variety of capability URLs and then display a composite\npage that includes navigation tools.\n\nEverything really is at your fingertips. Having the security model\nintegrated right into the programming model really simplifies\nthings. Imagine building an application that aggregates\ninformation from a bunch of different applications. With a\ncapability-based security model, you just suck in the XML and do\nyour thing. In an ACL model, you&#39;ve got the additional headache of\nmanaging credentials and authentication protocols with each\ndifferent application.\n\n&gt; If I am the WSJ, how do I restrict access while\n&gt; at the same time allow users to refer to the same\n&gt; document?\n\nYou were the one who suggested this design, not me. This is now\nthe third time that I have said that this is a bad idea. You would\nnot use the capability model to solve this problem.\n\nThere&#39;s a long explanation that I could go into on this, but I&#39;ll\njust give you the punch line. The WSJ scenario is *not* an access\ncontrol problem, it is a DRM (Digital Restrictions Management)\nproblem. The capability model is used for solving access control\nproblems, not DRM problems.\n\nTyler\n\n"}}
