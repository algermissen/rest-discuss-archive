The media-type must define how to discover  \n&gt; relationships between resources; and how the client can build  \n&gt; requests to interact with the server.  HTML and AtomPub do this  \n&gt; already.  Urge the audience to use these instead of rolling their own.\n\nI can&#39;t help but disagree about AtomPub (I think you mean to say  \nAtom). It provides a payload format with some generic metadata and  \nlinks, but it does not take away the need to define media types to  \ndescribe the contents of atom:content. So, if a server uses Atom to  \ndescribe a user, it needs to use some media type to describe that the  \ncontent is a user and not, say, a car.\n\n&gt; [25] Standardization\n&gt; I can&#39;t agree with this.  REST states constraints, but does not  \n&gt; define further specifics.  For WOA, I totally agree, because now it  \n&gt; includes HTTP, HTML, AtomPub, RDF, URIs, etc.\n&gt;\n\nYou had to bring in &quot;W&quot; again :) I still think that the distinction  \nyou are trying to make is not necessary. I also find it very  \ndistracting as encourages fluff around REST. There is enough fluff on  \nthe &quot;S&quot; side.\n\nSubbu\n---\nhttp://subbu.org\n\n\n"}}
