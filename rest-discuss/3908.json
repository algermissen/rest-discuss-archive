If &quot;whatever information&quot; means ALL information without data\n&gt; loss, the client can reasonably interpret the response to a GET to *BE* the\n&gt; server&#39;s representation. (Obviously when the client sends an Accept\n&gt; header, it accepting non-fidelity to the server&#39;s actual representation,\n&gt; but that is really beside the point here. GET without an Accept header\n&gt; implies fidelity).\n&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;\n\nSo suppose that a messaging system can accept in a POST mime/rfc822,\nxmtp,rss-rdf fragments, latex letter, etc. and stores messages in an\nrbds. What is the &quot;without data loss&quot; server representation... the SQL\n??\nand if if parse all those formats to deal with message objects, having\nmethods and so on... what is the &quot;without data loss&quot; server\nrepresentation? the serialized object ?\n\n\n&gt; In what sense does POSTing an RNA notification imply a request that it be \n&gt; accepted as a new subordinate of the inbox?\n&gt; What does it mean for a notification to be a new subordinate of an inbox?\n&gt; \n\nWhat does it mean for /you/ for a resource to be subordinate to an other\n? it is not related to the uri, since they are opaque. It is not a\n&#39;index&#39; question, since a file is subordinate to a directory (see rfc)\nand when you get a directory (at least in Apache) you get an index and\nnot the content. Do you mean that Apache violate http ?\nSo what is subordination ? For me, it is just a kind of &quot;relational\nintegrity&quot; in rdbs (foreign keys, on.. cascade, trigers...) \nan message(mid,from,date,body) table is subordinate to a\nbox(title,id,desc) by sub(box.id,message.mid). You can select an index\n(i.e. just all the ids of messages in the box) or an archive (all\nmessages) and to delete a box mean to delete all messages it contains.\nBut boxes and messages have there own namespaces (uri in the rest world)\nThis is how I understand subordination. (I don&#39;t mean that ressources\nmust be stored in an rdbs, it is just an analogy).\n\n\n"}}
