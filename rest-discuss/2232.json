Scalability becomes less of\na problem and more of an attribute of the architectural style of your\nsolution, because session is distributed across all the clients that access\na server&#39;s services.\n\nIn many existing web applications, sessions take up lots of memory, cause\nstate management headaches, and make clustering/load balancing more\ncomplicated/expensive than it needs to be.  Perhaps curing these evils will\neventually become a selling point (to distributed programmers, not marketing\ntypes) of the RESTful approach.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Mark Nottingham [mailto:mnot@...]\nSent: Monday, August 26, 2002 3:26 PM\nTo: Mark Baker\nCc: rest-discuss\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] Beating my head against the &quot;session management&quot;\nwall\n\n\nThat&#39;s an important distinction that I didn&#39;t make (and hadn&#39;t fully\nappreciated until Mark pointed it out) -\nclient state in itself isn&#39;t bad, it&#39;s enshrining it in the protocol\ninteractions that brings the problems.\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Mark Baker&quot; &lt;distobj@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;Mark Nottingham&quot; &lt;mnot@...&gt;\nCc: &quot;rest-discuss&quot; &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, August 26, 2002 12:13 PM\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] Beating my head against the &quot;session\nmanagement&quot; wall\n\n\n&gt; I agree with Mark completely.\n&gt;\n&gt; The main problem is that the current generation of browsers don&#39;t\n&gt; provide sufficient functionality to allow the client-side to maintain\n&gt; the necessary state required for some operations.  We&#39;ve talked about\n&gt; shopping baskets here before; their state should ideally be maintained\n&gt; at the client, not the server.  But currently there is no means for\n&gt; handling this on the client.\n&gt;\n&gt; But you could imagine browsing through a web site, dragging off\n&gt; products you want and dropping them in a local folder, then at some\n&gt; point dragging that folder and dropping it onto the &quot;checkout&quot;\n&gt; symbol within the web page.  No session required.\n&gt;\n&gt; I wonder how far you could take &quot;file upload&quot; in this direction?  And/or\n&gt; some Javascript to provide the local containers ...
