One of the rules of my personal site is that a GET on \nhttp://www.hackcraft.net/images/forestr/ will return a particular image \nthat is used as a background detail on a few pages. I haven&#39;t broken GET \nby imposing a rule beyond those in HTTP, I&#39;ve just defined how I use it.\n\nWebDAV uses HTTP in a particular way. It&#39;s perfectly reasonable to \nexpect it&#39;s use of PUT to be compliant with HTTP&#39;s definition of PUT \n(it&#39;s a bug otherwise) but completely unreasonable to expect how it uses \nPUT to define how all HTTP applications use PUT.\n\nI think the semantics of PUT are neither &quot;replace&quot; nor &quot;merge&quot; but \nrather &quot;assert&quot;.\n\nThe semantics of GET are also assert.\n\nClient is interested in a resource, GET causes the server to return a \nrepresentation of the resource. Server is therefore making assertions \nabout that resource.\n\nClient holds an opinion about the resource, PUT causes the client to \nsend a representation about the resource. Client is therefore making \nassertions about that resource.\n\n&quot;Replace&quot; and &quot;merge&quot; don&#39;t come into it. If our resources are files \nthen they might (and in that case &quot;replace&quot; is the only sensible \ninterpretation, but that still doesn&#39;t tell us whether one or many files \nare replaced).\n\nWith the vast majority or requests though the resource is not a computer \nfile. &quot;Replace&quot; and &quot;merge&quot; don&#39;t even have any real meaning with many \nresources.\n\n\n"}}
