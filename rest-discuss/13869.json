If this\n&gt; is an accepted practice, and without knowing what representations could be\n&gt; relevant to applications over the course of time; does it make sense to ever\n&gt; use negotiated representations for GET requests? Does the distinction\n&gt; between resource and representation have any practical value? Arguably not\n&gt; if this is the case.\n\nI would argue that there is no distinction between resource and\nrepresentation. If a resource has multiple representations, and they\nare not equal, then there&#39;s a problem. If they&#39;re not the same, the\noptions shouldn&#39;t be offered up at all. There can certainly be\ndifferent &quot;views&quot; of a resource, in different formats, but I do not\nthink any of these views should be considered canonical for the\nresource.\n\nThe format of the resource is really up to the client to choose.\nAsking an application to process a JSON formatted request when it can\nonly handle a XML formatted request isn&#39;t really useful.\n\nIf a server is going to serve up multiple representations, it will\nideally also accept them back.\n\nBut, you can see where this can cause problems, notably with lossy conversions.\n\nConsider:\nhttp://example.com/image.png\nhttp://example.com/image.jpg\nhttp://example.com/image.tiff\n\nSome could consider these the same resource, but clearly the JPEG is\nnot the same as the PNG, or, potentially, the TIFF.\n\nI would like to think that GET and PUT should be a commutative operation.\n\nFor example, you would like to hope that this is true, when practical\n\nA = GET http://example.com/resource Accept: application/xml\nB = GET http://example.com/resource Accept: application/json\nPUT http://example.com/resource Content-Type: application/json $B\nC = GET http://example.com/resource Accept: application/xml\nA.equals(C) == true\n\nClearly, though, that won&#39;t be the case if you GET and PUT a JPEG, the\nPNG will likely change due to the fact that the JPEG is lossy.\n\nBut it&#39;s hard to not argue that a JPEG is not a &quot;representation&quot; of\nthe PNG, it&#39;s just not the canonical representation.\n\nSeems to me that it would be better to somehow make it clear whether a\nreturned representation is the actual resource, rather than a\nprojected view of the resource that is, essentially, &quot;read only&quot;.\n\n\nFor example:\n\nGET http://example.com/resource Accept: image/png works fine.\n\nBut\n\nGET http://example.com/resource Accept: image/jpeg fails\n\nHowever,\n\nGET http://example.com/resource?view Accept: image/jpeg works because\nwe define the ?view attribute as a concept used to get non-authorative\nrepresentations of a resource, and the fact that the client used the\n?view attribute &quot;acknowledges&quot; that is what they&#39;re getting.\n\nClearly, this can get messy, but that&#39;s what I have buzzing around in my head.\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n(willh@...)\n\n"}}
