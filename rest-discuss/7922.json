A while ago I saw David Heinemeier-Hanssons\nbrillian=\r\nt keynote at RailsConf in summer 2006 [1]. He described the\nnew Rails 1.2 f=\r\neatures, including REST as a new way of programming\nwith Rails. After watch=\r\ning that video I dove deep into stuff about\nREST like videos, blog entries =\r\nand articles about this fascinating\ntopic. That way I found this wounderful=\r\n group a few weeks ago. It&#39;s a\npleasure to read your posts!\n\nNow I got stuc=\r\nk. Perhaps the following question is something somebody\nasked before in thi=\r\ns group, but I&#39;m afraid I couldn&#39;t find neither the\nquestion nor the answer=\r\n within the ~8000 posts of this group.\n\nDavid said in the video you should =\r\nuse own representations for\naggregations, states and events. He constructed=\r\n an example with\npersons and clubs. He asked: should persons know their clu=\r\nbs or should\nclubs know their members? He answered, that both solutions are=\r\n not\nright, because it feels not good to ask a club for persons or a person=\r\n\nfor club. Clubs shouldn&#39;t know anything about persons and persons\nshouldn&#39;=\r\nt know anything about clubs. He introduced a new class called\nMembership an=\r\nd objects from that class encapsulate the knowledge of\none person and one c=\r\nlub. He designed this litte REST system with three\nrepresentations: person,=\r\n club and membership.\n\nThat looked pretty cool to me! A membership is somet=\r\nhing explicit, and\nnot such implicit like having a list of persons in club =\r\nor a list of\nclubs in person. What would be if you would have to design inv=\r\nalide\nmemberships or a description of a membership or special memberships\nl=\r\nike V.I.P.s? That&#39;s ugly without having the class Membership, isn&#39;t it?\n\nOk=\r\nay, my world was enlightened. Everything was fine. I walked six\ninches over=\r\n the ground for the next few days or so.\n\nBut then I asked myself (and aske=\r\nd, ahem, harassed a lot of friends\nand colleagues) if this could be the ans=\r\nwer to every aggregation (and\nstate and event). David said it is, but he ha=\r\nsn&#39;t said why it is, or I\nhaven&#39;t heard or understand what he said.\n\nSo thi=\r\ns is the question: would you design, in a RESTful way, every\naggregation (a=\r\nnd state and event) with a class respectivly with a\nrepresentation?\n\nSome m=\r\ninor questions:\nIf yes: what&#39;s with a shopping cart and products in it. Wha=\r\nt would\nthat aggregating representation be named?\n\nIf no: what does David m=\r\neant in his keynote or what am I missing here?\n\nThank you very much to ever=\r\nyone who can show me the right way. Links\nto previous posts or articles cov=\r\nering this issue are also very welcome.\n\n   Bernd\n\n[1] http://www.scribemed=\r\nia.org/2006/07/09/dhh\n\n\n"}}
