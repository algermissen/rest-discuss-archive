(IMHO of course).\n\ni will take two examples where i have had to use cookies as keys to \nserver-side session state:\n1. shopping cart.\n2. authentication.\n\nit seems to me that early web/REST people may have thought shopping \ncarts would be handled as client side state, and be all posted to an \n/orders resource or whatever at the end.  however this isn&#39;t the \nreality of how client UAs work.  the state needs to be stored on the \nserver because there isn&#39;t any standard way of doing it on the client.  \nyou can&#39;t do this without a session, otherwise, what URI does the &#39;buy \nthis item&#39; POST operate on?\n\n&gt; Another popular use of cookies is as an alternative authentication\n&gt; mechanism. The chief motivation for this is the lack of control most\n&gt; user agents give application designers over the standard http\n&gt; authorisation mechanisms - no easy way of providing customised login\n&gt; prompts and no control over expiring authentication are two of the\n&gt; issues here. Does this application of cookies break REST principles?\n\ni think so.\n\nas mentioned by others, user agents need to display the entity returned \nby the server.  i would say they also need to supply &#39;log out&#39; UI and \nmake the current authentication status highly visible and obvious.\n\nregards,\n-vincent\n\n\n"}}
