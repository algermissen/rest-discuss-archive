It appears to me that this discussion is in =\r\ndanger of actually creating some foundation on one of the most difficult to=\r\n grok parts of ReST, and all I am seeing in response is group backlash.\n\nFr=\r\nom Eric&#39;s argument, the standard media types constraint of ReST is fullfill=\r\ned, over HTTP, by registering new media types with IANA. In the context of =\r\nHTTP, this is what a standardized media type is.\n\nNow, can anyone come back=\r\n with a solid, convincing argument that this is not the case?\n\nSome of us h=\r\nave to explain ReST to less techy, or less patient, junior developers :)\n\n(=\r\nFor the record, I understand some of the backlash. Eric&#39;s argument style is=\r\n... forceful :). And don&#39;t get me wrong, it would make my life easier as a =\r\ndeveloper NOT to have to register my mime types with IANA, but, from Eric&#39;s=\r\n arguments, he makes a very persueasive case of the benefits of doing so, o=\r\nf which, only one (fullfilling standardized media types constaint of ReST) =\r\nis ReST based.)\n\n\n\n"}}
