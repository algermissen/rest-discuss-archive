Making a \n&gt; Nic&gt;&gt; resource, which we normally consider atomically, \n&gt; Nic&gt;&gt; addressable at a lower level. But another way is to \n&gt; Nic&gt;&gt; make a video (or a VM fs) accessible over the uri \n&gt; Nic&gt;&gt; namespace.\n&gt;\n&gt; For example?  (Just curious)\n\nAh... sorry I was being conceptual.\n\nI have no concrete implementation of such a thing. But that&#39;s because\nI don&#39;t have an application for it.\n\nWhat I was saying is that, with REST you could easily do the kind of\nthings you do with content-ranges at a higher level.\n\nContent-range is still useful in very low level transfer\napplications. For example... curl or wget (or browsers) can employ\ncontent-range tricks to make sure that they only retrieve bits of a\nfile after an interrupted transfer.\n\nBut any higher level app might want to implement a resource space over\nthe top of a large object.\n\nImagine a DVD of Pirates of the Carribean for example (although I\nguess it might be an offence to even talk about downloading such a\nthing).\n\nYou might be able to download the whole file like this:\n\n   http://piratebay/pirates-of-the-carribean\n\nbut you might be able to get the first section of the DVD (are these\ncalled &quot;chapters&quot;?) like this:\n\n  http://piratebay/pirates-of-the-carribean/section1\n\nor to find the bit where Keira Knightley is talking about the pirate\ncode like this:\n\n  http://piratebay/pirates-of-the-carribean?actor=Knightely&says=more%20like%20guidelines%20anyway\n\nIt&#39;s up to the application.\n\nNow some of these things could also be done with content-range. But I\nwouldn&#39;t advocate it because that&#39;s a low level tool with a specific\npurpose.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
