Similarly, I have found that client tools like curl and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lwp-request make you jump through hoops to use PUT.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; curl -T filename url ?\n&gt; \n&gt; And you display the error messages how?\n\ncurl -f -T ?\n\n&gt;  and URL-encode the file how?\n\n??\n\n&gt; I have to be clear about my motivations here: to get real.  We talk about\n&gt; this stuff as if implementation was beneath us.  Oh, the REST evangelist\n&gt; goes, that&#39;s just CGI.  It&#39;s just server configuration.  It&#39;s just a bit\n&gt; of perl.  But *which* CGI?  Which configuration?\n\nEek, I think you&#39;ve got this all wrong Lucas.  REST is a guide.  It\nhelps you understand, in this case, the costs of using POST to do what\nyou&#39;d normally use PUT for.  It doesn&#39;t say &quot;Though must use PUT to do\nPUT-like things&quot;, nor does anybody here say that, except when the\ncontext is doing things perfectly RESTful ... which is very often a\ngreat objective to shoot for, but sometimes (though not as often as many\nwould believe) unattainable.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
