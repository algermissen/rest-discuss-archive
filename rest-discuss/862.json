Yes there are big \n&gt; companies trying to make money off fat central services. But ebXML \n&gt; has a lot of components and many of them are peer-to-peer.  And there \n&gt; are also several people including me who are going through the ebXML \n&gt; stage of development in order to come out on the other side with \n&gt; something much simpler.  Some of those people went thru the eCo \n&gt; framework before, which was very RESTful, and think ebXML went astray \n&gt; in RegRep.  \n\nI&#39;ve heard people say that eCo appears quite RESTful, but I haven&#39;t\nseen that in the look I&#39;ve had at it.\n\nAnyhow, I will of course help anybody who asks to know more, including\nyourself and any of your peers.  I&#39;m just not going to take it upon\nmyself to try and give them religion.  Please don&#39;t take that as a\nsnubbing; as I said, there&#39;s only so many hours in a day.\n\n(btw, bhaugen32@... appears to be rejecting emails with\n&quot;unknown user&quot;)\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
