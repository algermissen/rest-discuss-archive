The RFC doesn&#39;t\nsay\n&gt; &gt; much about sequencing of possible subcomponents of a URI path segment.\n&gt;\n&gt; From an implementation point of view I have control over the\n&gt; behaviour of the URI parser and could therefore normalize paths that\n&gt; differ only in the order of parameters contained in a path segment.\n&gt;\n&gt; In defining an implementation-specific rule for how to handle this\n&gt; unspecified behaviour would I be doing something inherently un-\n&gt; RESTful?\nIf the rule is hidden behind the server&#39;s implementation, it&#39;s not a\nproblem. Introducing a requirement that all clients understand this in order\nto even retrieve a representation of that resource  would be a problem. But\nthat&#39;s not what you are doing.\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also, it&#39;s interesting to note that the RFC uses &#39;parameter&#39; to talk\nabout\n&gt; &gt; subcomponents of path segments (the stuff between slashes) but most\n&gt; &gt; programmers use the term &#39;parameter&#39; to talk about the query terms (the\n&gt; &gt; stuff after the question mark).\n&gt;\n&gt; I feel that your point about most programmers thinking\n&gt; of &#39;parameters&#39; in URIs in terms of what goes into the query string\n&gt; is an important one as consumers of the web service I&#39;m designing\n&gt; may not be familiar with REST.  For a widely-used, public interface\n&gt; might the URI: /location?x=00001&y=00002 be more sociable?\nI think it would be, yes. There is also an existing format that specifies\nhow to construct a URI based on data that a client might already know\nabout - the HTML FORM element.\nIf your application would benefit from clients constructing the URI, rather\nthen discovering them purely via hypertext links, this extra capability may\nbe useful.\n\n\n"}}
