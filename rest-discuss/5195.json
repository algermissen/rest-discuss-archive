I was really worried, odd as it may seem, that I\nwas misunderstanding XML, hyperlinking, and REST. If it&#39;s a &quot;good\nexample&quot; in your opinion, I am tickled to death.

Mike Dierken&quot; &lt;mdierken@h...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; I think this is a good example of XML, hyperlinking and REST. But it\nseems\n&gt; all read-only, and I can&#39;t help but ask - couldn&#39;t these conversions\nbe done\n&gt; as a client library?\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;Ron&quot; &lt;tiltbike@y...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, August 23, 2005 8:32 AM\n&gt; Subject: [rest-discuss] Review?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; If anyone cares to look it over, I put up a REST-y web service at\n&gt; &gt; http://uber.engineer.co.summit.oh.us/ws/dms/ (That link will\nrespond\n&gt; &gt; with the introspection page). In fact, if it doesn&#39;t understand a\n&gt; &gt; request, it will usually respond with the introspection page.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It is running on CherryPy behind Apache; most of the heavy\nlifting is\n&gt; &gt; done by python.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It is used to drive the web page at\n&gt; &gt; http://uber.engineer.co.summit.oh.us/CSETools/DMS.cfm, which is\nmore\n&gt; &gt; user-oriented.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; One nice thing about the AJAX architecture -- I was able to use\nGET\n&gt; &gt; requests without exposing the users to a bunch of &quot;%20&quot;s and such\nin\n&gt; &gt; the address window of the browser.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you notice something bogus, let me know, because I will be\nusing\n&gt; &gt; the same technologies for my future WS&#39;s, so I&#39;d rather fix it\nnow.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ron\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
