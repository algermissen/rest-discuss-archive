Fielding&quot; &lt;fielding@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n\n&gt; &gt; Specifically, we are trying to find RESTful solutions to:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n1) Guaranteed Delivery - we need a paradigm to follow so that one service c=\r\nan transfer a sequence of resource representations to another reliably even=\r\n though both services and the network suffer temporary unreliability\n&gt; \n&gt; T=\r\nhat doesn&#39;t sound like a problem encountered by RESTful\n&gt; architectures.  R=\r\neliable upload of multiple files can be\n&gt; performed using a single zip file=\r\n, but the assumption being made\n&gt; here is that the client has a shared unde=\r\nrstanding of what the\n&gt; server is intending to do with those files.  That&#39;s=\r\n coupling.\n\nI don&#39;t follow. Several people have given good simple answers s=\r\naying to use the idempotent nature of PUT (or fake it with POST) until a GE=\r\nT of the resource succeeds or add an HTTP header of If-None-Match: * and re=\r\npeat the PUT until you get a 412 Precondition Failed response, so I thought=\r\n this was a slam dunk. \n\nBut that answers &quot;how&quot; and I think you are getting=\r\n at &quot;why&quot;. I&#39;m imagining that we have two servers A and B, where A plays th=\r\ne role of the client in the interaction. Events happen on server A and serv=\r\ner B must receive some representation related to each event or unacceptable=\r\n business consequences occur.\n\nWhy can&#39;t we merge the functionality of serv=\r\ner A and B? Lots of reasons: Security, regulatory compliance, use of 3rd pa=\r\nrty systems, organizational boundaries and/or politics are a few. The way a=\r\n company manages it&#39;s systems engineering work is to partition business fun=\r\nctionality into pieces, give ownership of each piece to a team, and align p=\r\nhysical resources like servers to those teams. If this imposes constraints =\r\nnot found in RESTful systems, then I have no choice but to deal with those.=\r\n \n\n\n&gt; Applications like that are usually accomplished via code-on-demand.\n&gt;=\r\n The problem you will run into here is implementation issues\n&gt; regarding cu=\r\nrrent browsers, not architectural issues and\n&gt; certainly not a style issue.=\r\n  Most such tools are developed\n&gt; as browser extensions or app-specific cli=\r\nents, mostly because\n&gt; they need unfettered access to the filesystem and be=\r\ncause\n&gt; browsers (for some unknown reason) don&#39;t include integrity checks\n&gt;=\r\n in normal file uploads.\n\nI expect the clients of most of our services woul=\r\nd count as &quot;app specific clients&quot;. These might be our other services, our a=\r\npp servers that host user interfaces, or sometimes we will allow external b=\r\nusiness entities (customers, partners, suppliers, etc...) to write such app=\r\ns directly. I don&#39;t mind going beyond browser limitations. \n\n&gt; &gt; 2) Distrib=\r\nuted Transactions - we need a paradigm to allow state changes on multiple s=\r\nervices to happen so that the changes succeed or fail as a unit\n&gt; \n&gt; Again,=\r\n not a characteristic of RESTful architectures.  If the\n&gt; client knows the =\r\ntransaction is distributed, you have failed.\n&gt; There are lots of ways to so=\r\nlve this kind of problem on the\n&gt; back-end of services interfaces, behind t=\r\nhe resource abstraction,\n&gt; but none of those are relevant to the REST archi=\r\ntectural style\n&gt; that might apply on the front-end of the service interface=\r\n.\n\nThis one I accept doesn&#39;t fit in a RESTful solution, and in other posts =\r\nin this thread, we are exploring several of other ways you mention.\n\n&gt; &gt; 3)=\r\n Long running operations - we need asynchronous invocations between service=\r\ns and a mechanism for the invoking service to find out when the invoked ser=\r\nvice is done given that this work may take indefinitely long\n&gt; \n&gt; Any resou=\r\nrce can behave as a long-running service.  Just program it that way.\n\nRight=\r\n, the question is how, exactly. Good solutions have been posted in this thr=\r\nead for this. Subbu&#39;s RESTful Web Services Cookbook solves this in examples=\r\n 1.10 and 1.11. I think this was another slam dunk.\n\nI&#39;m curious what you t=\r\nhink about using so called &quot;web hooks&quot; for this kind of thing. Would you co=\r\nnsider this a violation of the client-server constraint? \n\n&gt; &gt; 4) Workflow =\r\nOrchestration - we would like to have orchestration services that define bu=\r\nsiness processes via standardized representations (eg BPMN), then execute i=\r\nnstances of those processes and build up an process instance execution data=\r\n resource by interacting with other RESTful resources using message exchang=\r\ne patterns that could specify the above behaviors.\n&gt; \n&gt; That is a system, n=\r\not an integration problem.  If you want to\n&gt; solve it, buy a full-featured =\r\nWCM system like Day&#39;s CQ5.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.day.com/day/en/products/web_cont=\r\nent_management.html\n&gt; \n&gt; (sorry, I don&#39;t have a way to answer that one with=\r\nout sounding\n&gt; like a sales plug -- it is, after all, why I work for a WCM =\r\nvendor).\n\nNo need to apologize for pointing me to a product that might be u=\r\nseful for us. I&#39;ve been in several sales presentations in the last couple w=\r\neeks with different vendors who have big fancy workflow engines. They all w=\r\nant to talk about WS-BPEL and orchestrating our SOAP endpoints. I enjoy the=\r\n look of confusion when I mention that we are considering not allowing any =\r\nnew services to be created using SOAP. That seems to get their attention. T=\r\nhey say &quot;what will you do instead?&quot; and I say use HTTP and they say &quot;huh?&quot;.=\r\n \n\nI agree that what we are eventually looking for is a system. I just need=\r\n to know how to ask for that system. It would be especially useful if there=\r\n were open standards for media types that such a system might use. \n\nYou th=\r\nrough out the term &quot;WCM&quot; which I will go learn about.\n\n\n\n"}}
