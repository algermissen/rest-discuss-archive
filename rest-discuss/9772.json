I got some interesting\n&gt; responses to this.\n&gt;\n&gt; Another (RESTful?) solution could be to POST to a resource that is\n&gt; responsible for turning a lightbulb on. For example, POST &#92;lightswitch\n&gt; sending in the light bulb and state (on/off) chosen.\n&gt;\n&gt; My challenge with this second solution is that the other verbs will not\n&gt; be used against this resource, in essence this resource is pretty much a\n&gt; &quot;POST-only&quot; resource.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is that ok?\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nI&#39;d expect to be able to do GET /lightswitch and know if it is in on\nor off position.\n\n==&gt; GET /lightswitch\n\n&lt;== 200 OK\n&lt;== &lt;lightswitch&gt;&lt;state&gt;on&lt;/state&gt;&lt;/lightswitch&gt;\n\n\n\n\nI&#39;d also expect to be able to PUT /lightswitch and send in some\ndirective to control it.\n\n==&gt; PUT /lightswitch\n==&gt; &lt;lightswitch&gt;&lt;state&gt;off&lt;/state&gt;&lt;/lightswitch&gt;\n\n&lt;== 200 OK.\n\n\nFinally, depending on your domain rules, I&#39;d think that I can do a successful\nDELETE against it which could, say, be the analogous of removing a\nreal lightswitch, which may makes sense if you want a continously on light\nbulb or if you have no further need to control some circuit.\n\n\nYS.\n\nPS: &#39;/&#39; is the separator, not &#39;&#92;&#39;.\n\n\n"}}
