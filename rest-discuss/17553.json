I an\n&gt; unauthenticated user attempted a GET, clearly it should respond with a\n&gt; 401. However, if an /authenticated/ user attempts to GET, but that user\n&gt; is not permitted to access that resource, is that a 403? The spec says\n&gt; that &quot;Authorization will not help and the request SHOULD NOT be\n&gt; repeated.&quot; If the user is already authenticated, it is true that\n&gt; retrying the request will not work, however, if the user tries to\n&gt; re-authenticate with different credentials, he would be allowed to GET\n&gt; the resource.\n&gt;\n&gt; So is there a cut and dry answer? If not, is there a widely accepted\n&gt; convention?\n&gt; ...\n\nSee &lt;http://trac.tools.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/trac/ticket/294&gt; and \n&lt;http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2011AprJun/0256.html&gt;.\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n"}}
