But that can&#39;t be done if the client is\n&gt; behind a firewall.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bas=\r\nically, my intention is to piggyback the reverse request in a\n&gt; response to=\r\n a request from the client.  Then the client would respond by\n&gt; sending a n=\r\new request to the server, and so forth.  The resource URL for\n&gt; the reverse=\r\n request would now have to be encoded in the body of the HTTP\n&gt; response.\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Thoughts?\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Lyle Kopnicky\n&gt; Software Project Engineer\n&gt; Veicon Te=\r\nchnology, Inc.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
