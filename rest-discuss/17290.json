See (including the comments);\n\nI think this is a key issue too, and it&#39;s something we were aware of when\nI did the work on openflydata.org in 2009. We explored some ideas around\nrestricting the query language features exposed by an endpoint, to prevent some\nof the more obvious denial-of-service type vulnerabilities, which was part\nof the reason why we ended up rolling our own SPARQL protocol implementation\n[1]. There&#39;s a bit more discussion in the paper at [2]. Of course, even with\nrestricted language features, you can still write hard queries if you know\nhow, so this isn&#39;t a perfect strategy.\n\nWhat we really wanted to be able to do was be able to place a hard limit\non the amount of resources any one query could consume. A simple way to do\nthis might be to kill queries that took longer than X seconds, a la simpledb\n[3]. My colleage Graham Klyne and I had a chat with Andy Seaborne about doing\nthis with Jena TDB, which wasn&#39;t possible at the time, and Andy seemed to\nthink it was doable (?) but there were details around how TDB executed queries\nand also how TDB&#39;s various optimisers worked that I didn&#39;t fully understand,\nand we never had the time to follow this through. I haven&#39;t done any recent\nwork on SPARQL, so it may be that there are query engines out there that\nsupport this kind of thing out of the box.\n\nSo I guess I&#39;m saying, you may be right, but I wouldn&#39;t discount the viability\nof open sparql endpoints just yet, I think the jury&#39;s still out.\n\nCheers\n\nAlistair\n\n[1] http://code.google.com/p/sparqlite/\n[2] http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2010.04.004\n[3] http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonSimpleDB/latest/DeveloperGuide/index.html?SDBLimits.html\n\n-- \nAlistair Miles\nHead of Epidemiological Informatics\nCentre for Genomics and Global Health &lt;http://cggh.org&gt;\nThe Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics\nRoosevelt Drive\nOxford\nOX3 7BN\nUnited Kingdom\nWeb: http://purl.org/net/aliman\nEmail: alimanfoo@...\nTel: +44 (0)1865 287669\n\n"}}
