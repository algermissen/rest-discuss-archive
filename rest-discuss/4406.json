On the other hand, with the Java servlet API I never ever\n&gt; &gt;&gt;had any problem implementing handlers for PUT, so it&#39;s definitively not\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;fancy&quot; from my point of view. Nor are OPTIONS, PROPFIND, PROPPATCH or\n&gt; &gt;&gt;other new HTTP methods.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not going to argue abut the premise.  I asked in another thread\n&gt; &gt; whether there were people interested in a rest-dev kind of list and\n&gt; &gt; consensus was for using rest-discuss, but now in actually doing that I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; having to defend the concept.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m outta here.  Go back to how many angels fit on the head of a pin.\n&gt;\n&gt; Can&#39;t follow. You&#39;ll have to accept the fact that people will start to\n&gt; ask questions if what you write things they don&#39;t be understand. It&#39;s\n&gt; not anybody&#39;s fault; it&#39;s just how mailing lists work.\n\nThe thing here is that I&#39;m defending the premise rather than working out\nthe details.  The premise is: RESTful design is mature, implementation\nisn&#39;t.   Even something as ancient as PUT involves jumping through hoops.\nKnowing that is a step towards fixing it.  Being able to use REST rather\nthan, e.g., XML-RPC requires us to fix it.\n\nThis thread is a bug report or todo item.  I&#39;ve spent a ton of time\njustifying the concept of a bug report or todo item, which is senseless.\n\n\n"}}
