Is the following:\n\n    http://foo.bar.com/users/joe@...\n\na valid HTTP URI or not?  If so, what does it mean?  Skipping straight\nto the meat, my conclusion is that, grammatically per RFC 2396 and 2616,\nthe above probably *should* and is probably *intended* to be a valid URI\nwithout an authority component --- i.e., the &#39;@&#39; sign is not used to\nseparate the elements of an authority component, but rather\n&quot;joe@...&quot; is an opaque segment --- but strictly speaking it&#39;s\nimpossible to determine whether this is the case or not.  Comments?\nDangers of using this form of URI?  Etc.?\n\njb\n\n--------\nDetails\n--------\n\nRFC 2396, 2.2:\n\n   Many URI include components consisting of or delimited by, certain\n   special characters.  These characters are called &quot;reserved&quot;, since\n   their usage within the URI component is limited to their reserved\n   purpose.  If the data for a URI component would conflict with the\n   reserved purpose, then the conflicting data must be escaped before\n   forming the URI.\n\n      reserved    = &quot;;&quot; | &quot;/&quot; | &quot;?&quot; | &quot;:&quot; | &quot;@&quot; | &quot;&&quot; | &quot;=&quot; | &quot;+&quot; |\n                    &quot;$&quot; | &quot;,&quot;\n\n   The &quot;reserved&quot; syntax class above refers to those characters that are\n\n   allowed within a URI, but which may not be allowed within a\n   particular component of the generic URI syntax; they are used as\n   delimiters of the components described in Section 3.\n\n3.2. Authority Component\n\n   Many URI schemes include a top hierarchical element for a naming\n   authority, such that the namespace defined by the remainder of the\n   URI is governed by that authority.  This authority component is\n   typically defined by an Internet-based server or a scheme-specific\n   registry of naming authorities.\n\n      authority     = server | reg_name\n\n   The authority component is preceded by a double slash &quot;//&quot; and is\n   terminated by the next slash &quot;/&quot;, question-mark &quot;?&quot;, or by the end of\n\n   the URI.  Within the authority component, the characters &quot;;&quot;, &quot;:&quot;,\n   &quot;@&quot;, &quot;?&quot;, and &quot;/&quot; are reserved.\n\n...but we&#39;re beyond the authority component, at least semantically, in\nmy example URI.  It may be that some parsers incorrectly use the first @\nsymbol to identify the authority component...  strictly, though, it\nwould appear that everything&#39;s good so far in using the @ sign in this\nmanner outside an authority component.  Now to the meat of the matter.\nBy the grammar introduced in RFC 2396:\n\n3.3. Path Component\n\n   The path component contains data, specific to the authority (or the\n   scheme if there is no authority component), identifying the resource\n   within the scope of that scheme and authority.\n\n      path          = [ abs_path | opaque_part ]\n\n      path_segments = segment *( &quot;/&quot; segment )\n      segment       = *pchar *( &quot;;&quot; param )\n      param         = *pchar\n\n      pchar         = unreserved | escaped |\n                      &quot;:&quot; | &quot;@&quot; | &quot;&&quot; | &quot;=&quot; | &quot;+&quot; | &quot;$&quot; | &quot;,&quot;\n\nCrosschecking this with RFC 2616:\n\n3.2.1 General Syntax\n\n    ...For definitive information on\n   URL syntax and semantics, see &quot;Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI):\n   Generic Syntax and Semantics,&quot; RFC 2396 [42] (which replaces RFCs\n   1738 [4] and RFC 1808 [11]). This specification adopts the\n   definitions of &quot;URI-reference&quot;, &quot;absoluteURI&quot;, &quot;relativeURI&quot;, &quot;port&quot;,\n\n   &quot;host&quot;,&quot;abs_path&quot;, &quot;rel_path&quot;, and &quot;authority&quot; from that\n   specification.\n\n3.2.2 http URL\n\n   The &quot;http&quot; scheme is used to locate network resources via the HTTP\n   protocol. This section defines the scheme-specific syntax and\n   semantics for http URLs.\n\n   http_URL = &quot;http:&quot; &quot;//&quot; host [ &quot;:&quot; port ] [ abs_path [ &quot;?&quot; query ]]\n\nSo here&#39;s the sticky bit in interpreting this.  An HTTP URI includes an\nabs_path...  which resolves to segments, not paths...  however both\nultimately resolve to pchars, for which &#39;@&#39; is an acceptable character.\nHere&#39;s the ambiguous bit:  tracing from\n\nabs_path -&gt; path_segments -&gt; segment -&gt; pchar, params -&gt; pchar\n\n*it doesn&#39;t appear from the grammar defined in 3.2.2 that an authority\ncomponent may be included.*  However, 2616 5.1.2 identifies a correctly\nformed Request-URI as being:\n\n       Request-URI    = &quot;*&quot; | absoluteURI | abs_path | authority\n\n...which is even more mysterious, as it says you can pass an authority\ncomponent *but only as the only component of a Request-URI?*\n\nMy conclusion is that, grammatically per RFC 2396 and 2616,\n\n        http://foo.bar.com/users/joe@...\n\nprobably *should* and is probably *intended* to be a valid URI, but\nstrictly speaking it&#39;s impossible to determine whether in fact it is or\nit isn&#39;t.  Comments?  Dangers of using this form of URI?  Etc.?\n\njb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
