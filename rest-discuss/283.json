I suppose a GET might\n&gt; instead return an HTML page or XML document describing the current\n&gt; supscription state.\n&gt;\nIf you ensure multiple GETs don&#39;t pop the head off the queue then you can\nuse it.\nYou&#39;d need an explicit &#39;ack&#39; to pop the head off the queue. Perhaps DELETE\nwould do it, but I don&#39;t know whether that is correct or not - whether that\nbreaks the &#39;queue modelled as a resource&#39; concept.\nGET returning an explicit list of messages with ids might be more resty...\nhard to say.\n\n"}}
