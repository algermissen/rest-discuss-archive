Does that necessarily imply that there is \n&gt; now\n&gt; also a resource named /foo/bar?  That is, if I start with an empty\n&gt; hierarchy and no resources, then do a PUT to /foo/bar/xyz, is there\n&gt; anything about REST or HTTP that dictates that  I now have three\n&gt; resources rather than one?\n\nWhat is a resource?  What makes you think it didn&#39;t exist before the \nPUT?\n\nYeah, I know that&#39;s an annoying answer, but it is quite pointless to be\ndiscussing these things if we aren&#39;t even clear on what is a resource.\n\nA resource is a source for *future* responses to future requests.  Thus,\nthe resource will already exist by virtue of you eventually doing the \nPUT,\nand what you are doing with those requests is changing the responses\nto future requests.  Whether or not those ancestral names, or any other\nnames that might have been created by the usual side-effects, are\naccessible to future requests (and hence are resources) is defined by\nthe server and not by the protocol (or even the style).\n\nThe server might choose to reject the PUT request simply because it\nwants access control to be specified first.  Interoperability is\nobtained not by restricting the behavior of the server, but by\nrequiring that the server respond according to its desires and\nenabling the client to understand that response.\n\nOne of the keys to understanding how REST works is to understand that\nthe implementations have no clue what the resource is or how it is\ndefined or what, in fact, makes it a resource.  That is just too hard\na concept for the implementations to handle.  Even the human beings\nmaintaining the site have a hard time figuring that one out, because\nwe just aren&#39;t very good at predicting the future.  In contrast,\nit is relatively easy to talk about representations, storing them\nand mapping them to names that are resources, since those are\noperations that manipulate bits in the &quot;now&quot; and are easy for\nserver mechanisms to understand and implement.\n\nThus, it is not necessary to know what the fate of /foo/bar/ might\nbe after a\n\n    PUT /foo/bar/thing\n\neven though we do know what its fate will be after a\n\n    DELETE /foo/\n\nhas successfully completed.  Note, however, that the success of the\nfirst request does not imply that the server must allow the second\nrequest.  It may choose to forbid it (for any reason).\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
