I&#39;ll skip the SEO discussion, that&#39;s not the inter=\r\nesting part for me.\n\n&gt; Your resource, http://www.mysite.com/blogs/peter, ca=\r\nn return anything\n&gt; you need it to return, regardless of any back-end API.\n=\r\n\nYes. But I have to point out that www.mysite.com is not the same as my bac=\r\nkend rest.mysite.com. The www site has no database in it. It is a simple sy=\r\nstem that just transforms ATOM feeds exactly like you describe. I don&#39;t wan=\r\nt the www site to return anything but HTML. If someone wants the ATOM feed,=\r\n I&#39;ll give them the backend REST resource URL.\n\nThe point here is that if I=\r\n construct the REST API first, and build my website on that then I am guara=\r\nnteed that I have a usefull and working REST API for the rest of the world =\r\nto use. My system becomes open by design, not as an afterthought.\n\nThe inte=\r\nresting point is: how does my www site find the correct ATOM resouce when t=\r\nhe only thing it has in it&#39;s URL is &quot;peter&quot;, as in http://www.mysite.com/bl=\r\nogs/peter.\n\nI can see two solutions: \n\n1) The www site have apriori knowled=\r\nge of how to transform &quot;peter&quot; into the backend resource http://rest.mysite=\r\n.com/feeds/peter\n\n2) The complete resource reference is included in the URL=\r\n, as in  http://www.mysite.com/blogs/http%3a2f%2frest.mysite.com%2ffeeds%2f=\r\npeter\n\n&gt; There&#39;s really no need to put the URI of a &quot;REST\n&gt; resource&quot; into =\r\nthe URI of a request.\n\nBut this is exactly my problem: if I do not want to =\r\nuse apriori information about the REST resource&#39;s URL format, then I must i=\r\nnclude the complete REST URL into my www URL. \n\nEither I get a very tight i=\r\nntegration with my backend REST API, by utilizing apriori information, or I=\r\n must include complete resource URLs in my www URL.\n\nConsider a situation w=\r\nhere the owner of the website merges with another company, leading to a sit=\r\nuation where we have two backend REST APIs - the original one, and one for =\r\nthe new company. We want to present both backend datasets on the same www s=\r\nite. Which URL template should I use to convert &quot;peter&quot; into a resource? Th=\r\ne original or the new? What if both datasets has a &quot;peter&quot; blog? Now it bec=\r\nomes clearer that putting the full resource URL into my www URL can be nice=\r\n.\n\n\n/J=F8rn\n\n\n"}}
