But, I don&#39;t think this is a good solution. All I&#39;m doing is\ninitialising a bunch of objects, collecting them together, and then\ncalling the add operation. Should I be thinking this way ...\n\nI&#39;m trying to stop myself, but what I want to do is to pass URI&#39;s as\narguments, but I know I shouldn&#39;t be doing it :) ! \n\nCan someone improve my thinking please ... help me to see things from\na different perspective ? \n\nThanks, \n\nYadnem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
