Most people (developers, managers, executives)\n&gt;  I&#39;ve talked with in the past few years regarding REST just think of it as a\n&gt;  label like all other techno-marketing-babble. It doesn&#39;t occur to them that\n&gt;  there actually is something to learn here. The engineering teams are too\n&gt;  busy making legacy systems accessible via the Web that they don&#39;t think\n&gt;  about designing /for/ the Web.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Most places are simply trying to do /something/ to get developers involved -\n&gt;  they really have no notion of &#39;good&#39; or &#39;thoughtful&#39;, merely getting others\n&gt;  involved is sufficient. They also are trying to deliver what they think\n&gt;  developers want or are asking for. If developers call this rubbish and ask\n&gt;  for something better, then it&#39;ll change. Otherwise, it&#39;ll stay and only the\n&gt;  most broken bits will change - slowly.\n\nThat&#39;s a scarily accurate description of my experience with publishers\nmoving over to soft publishing methods. They are so far behind, and so\nill informed, that *any* information is taken on board.\n\nAs for future thinking... No chance.\n\nregards\n\n\n-- \nDave Pawson\nXSLT XSL-FO FAQ.\nhttp://www.dpawson.co.uk\n\n"}}
