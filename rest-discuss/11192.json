The problem I&#39;ve=\r\n just encountered is regarding\n&gt; the best way to design my URI for data tha=\r\nt is a subset of the parent\n&gt; resource and can be filtered by multiple para=\r\nmeters.\n&gt;\n&gt; For example lets say I have a collection of Books and I&#39;d like =\r\nto\n&gt; optionally filter by Category and/or Year published.\n&gt;\n&gt; My first (pro=\r\nbably not very restful idea) was to create something  \n&gt; like:\n&gt; /books?cat=\r\negory=3Dscifi&year=3D2008\n&gt;\n&gt; Then I thought about a hierarchy\n&gt; /books/{ca=\r\ntegory}/{year}\n&gt; but then I would also need\n&gt; /books/{year}/{category}\n&gt; Bu=\r\nt this makes it seem like one category is a child of year or vice\n&gt; versa w=\r\nhich isn&#39;t correct. Plus as I add filters I&#39;d need all sorts\n&gt; of combinati=\r\nons.\n&gt;\n&gt; The other option I read about involves putting them at the same le=\r\nvel\n&gt; separated by a comma or semicolon:\n&gt; /books/{year},{category}\n&gt; But t=\r\nhen seems king of messy since it&#39;s possible to omit a filter and\n&gt; then I&#39;d=\r\n have something like\n&gt; /books/,sci-fi\n&gt;\n&gt; So far the original query variabl=\r\ne URI still seems to make the most\n&gt; sense to me. Does anybody have a bette=\r\nr suggestion or opinion on how\n&gt; best to do this?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for taking the=\r\n time to read my post and I look forward to\n&gt; reading you opinions.\n&gt;\n&gt; Che=\r\ners,\n&gt; Randal\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
