Client software should not\n&gt; &gt; inspect URIs to try and figure out the structure of a server&#39;s data\n&gt; &gt; model.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is it okay for a client to be /told/ what the structure of a server&#39;s data\n&gt; model (with respect to URIs) is? and then do URI munging?\n\nFirst, let&#39;s acknowledge that &quot;URI munging&quot; is sometimes necessary.\nThat&#39;s why the Web infrastructure has explicit support for it, as you\nsay:\n\n&gt; Aren&#39;t HTML FORM elements a set of inputs to some agreed-upon-instructions\n&gt; for generating URIs?\n\nSo the opacity principle has always been: opacity by default and\ntransparency when you need it. WRDL even deepens the support for URI\ngeneration through strong typing etc. And this interoperates with the\nhierarchical parts of the URI because the query typically generates an\nindex OVER the hierarchical namespace. It&#39;s like a Unix &quot;find&quot; command.\nThe find command itself is non-hierarchical but the results it returns\nare in a hierarchical space.\n\nSo now that we&#39;ve agreed that URI munging is necessary (as Tim\nBerners-Lee did in his 1996 document on URI opacity), Jeff&#39;s instinct is\nto open the floodgates and allow arbitrary manipulations of URIs. In\ntheory, this is probably okay as long as it is under complete server\ncontrol (as HTML forms and query parameters are). But what would it take\nto make it really work reliably on the Web? Jeff suggests that we need a\nset of generative grammar schema languages that can be shared between\nclient and server. And we need a form of &quot;namespaces&quot; for URIs. And we\nneed strong typing for components of namespaces. And...etc. etc.\n\nCan you see that he is going to end up reinventing everything that has\nbeen done in the markup world? And he won&#39;t make a single &quot;opaque data\nobject&quot; addressable that would otherwise be non-addressable because it\nwill take *effort* on the part of the information owner to generate\nthese generative grammars and they could just as easily implement an\nindex using queries today. So we&#39;ll put in a bunch of effort inventing a\nbunch of new technologies that buy no new power. \n\nReally, the question boils down to whether the mapping from primitive\nvalues (e.g. dates) to addressable objects (e.g. dated webcam snapshots)\nhappens on the client or the server. And we all know about the effort it\ntakes to deploy new technologies on the client (browsed many XML/XSLT\npages lately?) versus the server. So the whole project is doomed from\nthe start because it doesn&#39;t buy anything and it has tremendous costs.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
