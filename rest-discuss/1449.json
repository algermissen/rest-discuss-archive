Remember that an important requirement is that new\n&gt;&gt;&gt; resources will be created all of the time with no human interaction.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I think it was noted before that this information is available in most\n&gt;&gt; environments; it&#39;s more a question of whether people will use it, and\n&gt;&gt; whether they&#39;ll be encouraged to use it. I&#39;m somewhat hopeful that\n&gt;&gt; progress can be made here.\n&gt;\n&gt; I may have missed this note.\n&gt;\n&gt; Here&#39;s what I remember: A few weeks ago Sam Ruby pointed me to a few\n&gt; Axis documents that I couldn&#39;t interpret.\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/1291\n\n&gt; Yesterday, Mike Dierken said: &quot;my guess is that it is pretty easy to\n&gt; route HTTP requests to HTTP handlers based on a URI pattern&quot; and &quot;If you\n&gt; did route this way - via common HTTP URI based handling - then the SOAP\n&gt; receiver probably won&#39;t be coded to know the HTTP URI - the info would\n&gt; have to be replicated within the SOAP body.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Which in my mind defeats the whole purpose. The SOAP elements are still\n&gt; the canonical address for the referenced object, not the URI. The URI is\n&gt; more or less ignored.\n\nI disagree.\n\nhttp://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/stories/2002/01/25/whatObjectDoesSoapAccess.html\n\n- Sam Ruby\r\n--0__=0ABBE147DFFA435D8f9e8a93df938690918c0ABBE147DFFA435D\r\nContent-type: text/html; charset=US-ASCII\r\nContent-Disposition: inline\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--0__=0ABBE147DFFA435D8f9e8a93df938690918c0ABBE147DFFA435D--\r\n\n"}}
