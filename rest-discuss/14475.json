In most cases\n&gt;&gt;&gt; there&#39;s plenty of wiggle-room on response codes, so that&#39;s left to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the API to describe.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; No, the error codes need no description - they are fully described\n&gt;&gt; by RFC 2616.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Please see sections 4.4 and 5.5 of RFC 5023.\n\nI know - but RFC 5023 should actually not do that.\n\n&gt;  Response codes are indeed\n&gt; described by HTTP, that isn&#39;t the issue.  The issue is what response  \n&gt; is\n&gt; issued to what request, and that isn&#39;t defined by media type.\n\nNo, it is completely up to the server. The server may respond in any  \nway, as long as the response is correctly telling the client what  \nhappened (e.g. send 201 when a resource has been created). The  \nexamples in RFC 5023 do actually tell you nothing about how a given  \nserver might choose to respond.\n\n&gt; My Atom\n&gt; Protocol implementation may respond 202 Accepted instead of 201  \n&gt; Created\n&gt; because I&#39;ve implemented moderation of new content.  Only my API can\n&gt; describe that authoritatively.\n\nNo, RFC2616 describes what has to happen. Return 201 upon creation and  \n202 if the request has been accepted but not yet been processed.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; A system&#39;s security implementation isn&#39;t described by its\n&gt;&gt;&gt; media types, so your API has to describe the use of HTTP Digest,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; user roles, and such.  Your API does this via hypertext --\n&gt;&gt;&gt; descriptive error\n&gt;&gt;&gt; responses with links instead of the default 4xx response message,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for example.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I was referring to design time documentation, not runtime.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I know you were.  But, a REST system combines self-descriptive\n&gt; messaging with a self-documenting API.\n\nWhat is a &#39;self documenting API&#39;?\n\n&gt;  You can write out-of-band\n&gt; documentation for it to your heart&#39;s content.  But that documentation\n&gt; ought to be reflected at runtime, so I can know exactly how your  \n&gt; system\n&gt; works by stepping my way through it using curl or a protocol analyzer,\n\nYou can never know from observing an interaction at a given time how  \nthe server might respond the next time.\n\n\n&gt; without having to constantly refer to the design-time documentation.\n\nWhat &#39;design time documentation&#39; are you refering to?\n\nJan\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; -Eric\n\n--------------------------------------\nJan Algermissen\n\nMail: algermissen@...\nBlog: http://algermissen.blogspot.com/\nHome: http://www.jalgermissen.com\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n"}}
