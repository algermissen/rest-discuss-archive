One thing that seems to be controversial is that\nWEBDAV has a notion of a collection, which is a URI that denotes a\ncollection of member URIs in a hierarchy.\n\nWhat I am looking for is some suggestions as I try to develop a best\npractices handbook for developers in my company.\n\nFrom my reading of most of the REST articles, REST doesn&#39;t specify a\ndifference between the following URIs.\n\nhttp://www.parts-depot.com/parts\nhttp://www.parts-depot.com/parts/\n\nThis seems to me to be an ambiguity that should be at least summarized\nin a Best Practices document.  Does anyone have any opinions or\nexamples of how they resolved this issue in their own application designs?\n\nWEBDAV specifies that the second example URI\n&quot;http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/&quot;  denotes a collection, which has\nproperties that are distinct from a member URI.  This notion alters\nhow a collection URI responds or interact with HTTP commands such as\nGET, POST, etc.  In particular, the WEBDAV spec does not require that\na GET on a collection return a conanical list of all it&#39;s contained\nmember URI&#39;s.  That at least seems to violate the REST best practice\nof discoverability, however it does offer a potential way to\nconsistantly handle the problem of when the member URI list is very\nlong, such as if there are millions of parts under the given example.\n\nI appreciate peoples thoughts and comments, and I plan to make\nwhatever best practices documents I develop for my company available\nto the community for comment.\n\nthanks!\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
