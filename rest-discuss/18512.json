Improving the evolvability of M2M applications in a\n&gt;&gt; significant way? I think more work is needed to prove this beyond\n&gt;&gt; doubt.\n&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;for what?&quot; how about &quot;hey, an input is expected here&quot;? for my work,\n&gt; this is &quot;useful&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; as to &quot;improving evolvability&quot; i can only assume what you are after\n&gt; here. for the work i do, the ability to include inputs when needed,\n&gt; have a client handle them (in whatever way that client deems\n&gt; appropriate) is adequate for the use cases i encounter. that is the\n&gt; only assertion i make.\n&gt;\n&gt; i&#39;m not sure what is needed to &quot;prove beyond doubt&quot; unless you expect\n&gt; to me prove to _you_ that _I_ find them adequate for my use cases.\n\nHow significant their impact on evolvability is in real terms.\n\ni.e. examples of changes in M2M application flow which are afforded by\nforms and cannot be achieved via a more simple control (i.e. &#39;basic&#39;\nlinking).\n\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; As an application evolves over time, servers can add/remove inputs at\n&gt;&gt;&gt; selected points in the user-agent&#39;s interactions w/ the server, too.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; These decisions can be completely context dependent. For example,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; selected users (admins) might see diff inputs than others (guests).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Right, this is mostly an &#39;aesthetic&#39; thing though, which would have\n&gt;&gt; little/no value to M2M agents. The server side still needs security,\n&gt;&gt; and agents will still be built against a specific role.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; adding/removing inputs in representations may &quot;have little/no value&quot;\n&gt; for your use cases; i am not asserting to the contrary. i will say\n&gt; again, this has value for my use cases; do you want to convince me the\n&gt; opposite?\n\nNo no, just to share my perspective on whether or not they do - in the\nhope that I can understand how, in practical terms, forms allow you to\nachieve interactions and changes to your system which could not be\nafforded with links.\n\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; During certain times (i.e. the DB is temporarily offline and does\n&gt;&gt;&gt; support writes) inputs could simply be removed from forms for a time.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If this was modeled without forms - the client would simply provide\n&gt;&gt; the info which can&#39;t be processed but the server can just drop that\n&gt;&gt; and deal with the bits it can, right ?\n&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; absolutely. i am not saying that modeling these cases with forms is\n&gt; the only/best way to do it. folks are free to implement interactions\n&gt; using any media type designs that they wish.\n&gt;\n\nSure, I guess my point was that this capability doesn&#39;t really set\nforms apart, because this type interaction is already possible with\nlinks and relations.\n\nI think all of the above are important considerations, because\nintroducing forms into your application places additional requirements\non your clients.\nFor many, reducing the barrier to adoption by making consumption of\nyour application as easy as possible is important - so with stuff like\nforms it&#39;s worth weighing this against their benefits.\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n"}}
