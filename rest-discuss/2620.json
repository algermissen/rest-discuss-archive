When I \nwent there and read the entire thread, Mark&#39;s response made more sense. \n In fact, my own notion of what a resource is (in HTTP) and the \nrelationship between URIs and resources has changed somewhat.\n\nAt least for me, it was interesting and instructive to follow the entire \nthread and some of the side-threads it generated.  In partciular, there \nwere two messages [2] [3] that talked about the concept of resources \nbeing composed of other resources - especially where a resource has \nmultiple representations.  These shed some light on the limitations of \nPUT with regard to representations and changed my notion of how content \nnegotiation fits into the bigger picture .\n\n[1]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/2002Sep/0045.html\n[2]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/2002Sep/0046.html\n[3]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/2002Sep/0028.html\n\n\n(I hate that archives are broken out by month - it makes it so much \nharder to follow threads that span more than one month).\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n"}}
