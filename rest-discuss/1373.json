The &quot;ticketed&quot; state is signified \nby a hyperlink to a Ticket resource on the airline site.  (I&#39;m not \nnecessarily suggesting this as a REST model for your scenario, just \nas an example for discussion.)\n\n* A business entity type (e.g. a Trip type or Order type) has a \npublic state machine published by a company or standards org.  Each \nstate in the state machine is a resource. Every entity that is an \ninstance of that type hyperlinks to its current State resource, which \ngives rules, transitions to possible next states, etc. \n\nFor the state-alignment transaction model (which I think will work in \nREST, contrary to some recent statements on the ws-arch list), \nparticipants do need to agree on states.  One way to do that would be \nto publish the state-transition model for an entity type as \nhypertext, and have each resource that wants to be an instance of the \ntype link to the same set of states.\n\nThere are other ways to do it, but that&#39;s one way.\n\n\n\n"}}
