I&#39;m\nposting this not some much as serious proposal to enhance the spec,\nbut more to get some feedback on whether I&#39;m &quot;getting&quot; REST.\n\nIn Paul&#39;s spec at\nhttp://internet.conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/HttpEvents,  the\nvarious scenarios all involve using the Event-Target header to specify\na URI where events will be delivered. This URI might be a micro server\non the application client, or a third party event queuing/forwarding\nservice.\n\nOne additional scenario occurred to me. Suppose the server application\nis willing to queue events for the client. In that case, the Client\ncould POST to the Subscription URI without the Event-Target header.\nThe response to the Subscription would still include the Location:\nheader (a URI that represents the subscription). The Client would then\nPOST to the subscription URI to retrieve queued events, or DELETE to\nend the susbscription. \n\nI originally was thinking that the client could GET the subscription\nURI in order to retrieve queued events, but now I think that that\nwould be wrong, because a GET in this case would change the state of\nthe resource by returning any queued events. I suppose a GET might\ninstead return an HTML page or XML document describing the current\nsupscription state.\n\nSo, does this proposal make sense? If not, I&#39;d like to learn where I\nwent wrong.\n\nThanks,\n\nJim Ancona\njim@...\n\n\n"}}
