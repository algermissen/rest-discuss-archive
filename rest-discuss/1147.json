Like functional programming, the focus is on\ncomposition.  Resources, like monads, hide state --- any given\ninteraction is stateless in some sense.  These are just a couple of\nobvious parallels;  it&#39;s an interesting question, though, and I would\nsuggest that the similarity is much deeper than it might appear at first\nglance.  (In fact, my own as-yet unfruitful efforts to formally\ndemonstrate certain things about the complexity of REST-like vs. OOP\nsystems relies on a certain functional model of REST;  one of these\ndays, maybe hopefully, that investigation will be ready for prime time.\n:-)\n\nBTW, let&#39;s be careful not to facilely and incorrectly assume that REST\nbeing &quot;incompatible&quot; with OOP says anything negative about REST; \nindeed, I&#39;m beginning to think that there are several research and\nengineering trends converging towards a recognition that OOP doesn&#39;t\ngive us what we wanted in terms of re-use, maintainability, etc....\n\njb\n\n\n"}}
