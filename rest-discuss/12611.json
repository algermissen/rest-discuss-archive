When the user\nexecutes the drop, the script will concatenate the name of the box image and\nthe name of the creature image and update the src attribute of the box\nimage:\n\n&lt;img src=&quot;animal_fish.png&quot; /&gt;\nor\n&lt;img src=&quot;veggie_granite.png&quot; /&gt;\n\nUpon receiving the GET request for the &quot;new&quot; image, the server can use rules\non the server to evaulate the validity of the URI and return the proper\nresponse.\n\nFor example:\nGET /animal_fish.png could return 200 OK and an image that indicating\nsuccess (green check mark)\nbut\nGET /veggie_granite.png could return 404 Not Found and an image indicating\nfailure (a red X)\n\nHopefully, this gives you some ideas on how to implement your solution.\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\n\n\n\nOn Sun, May 17, 2009 at 18:36, Michael Schuerig &lt;michael@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m pondering how a RESTful service can best support a highly\n&gt; interactive UI.
