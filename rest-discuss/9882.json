Upon login , the server sets two cookies: DASE_USER which\n&gt;    pkeane&gt; simply contains the user&#39;s user_id and DASE_AUTH which\n&gt;    pkeane&gt; contains an encrypted string which the server will be able\n&gt;    pkeane&gt; to decode to extract the user_id.  (Security note --\n&gt;    pkeane&gt; vulnerable to replay attacks, but there are a few ways those\n&gt;    pkeane&gt; dangers might be mitigated & besides, pretty good security\n&gt;    pkeane&gt; is what we are after)\n&gt;\n&gt; You don&#39;t need this. On the backend you have the user who logged in\n&gt; (REMOTE_USER), you use that to emit some JavaScript in the output that\n&gt; pulls the user specific stuff with XHR.\n\nI&#39;m not sure that&#39;ll work for me.  The login method I use is NOT http \nbasic auth (forgive my ignorance if I am mistaken, but it is the auth \nheader from which the server gets REMOTE_USER?) unless I can use \njavascript to set the authentication information in the browser (I am \nunaware of how to do that w/o presenting the user with the little HTTP \nbasic login window).  The reason is that I use a pluggable authentication \nscheme that, in my case, uses our university&#39;s single sign-on system \n(that&#39;s a requirement and other universities will either have similar \nrequirements or will use Shibboleth).  In the case of single sign-on, the \nuser is redirected to a university sign on page and then returned with a \nsecure cookie that the authentication module in the backend (it actually \nuses a university-sanctioned apache module) know how to decrypt and get \nthe user&#39;s id (Note: this is not unlike Google&#39;s AuthSub).  It&#39;s THAT id \nthat I use to set DASE_USER.  Note that I am now done with the DASE_USER \ncookie as far as the server goes.  It&#39;ll only be used by the client to \ngenerate appropriate XHR url&#39;s when necessary.  It&#39;s a piece of session \nstate, but it lives on the client, not the server.\n\nthanks-\nPeter Keane\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;\n&gt; Berend de Boer\n&gt;\n\n"}}
