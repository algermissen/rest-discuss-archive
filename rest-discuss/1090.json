Plus you could use a base class for anything repetitive.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; I suppose some clever base class could do this work, and call\n&gt; metadata_get() and metadata_put() methods.\n\nGood idea. \n\n&gt; &gt;They have accepted my\n&gt; &gt;requirement that WSDL should support links as an official requirement...\n&gt; \n&gt; Wouldn&#39;t PUT/DEL also need to be supported in order to implement all\n&gt; of REST?\n\nI&#39;m planning to submit that as a &quot;WSDL 1.1 bug report&quot; and see if it\ngets fixed. I&#39;m somewhat of a REST heretic in that I think that you get\na big chunk of the benefit from GET and POST is a way to handle\nnon-idempotent stuff. I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s ideal but that its probably\nsufficient. Worse comes to worse, you \n\n&gt; &gt;True. In my mind the primary weakness with WRDL is that it isn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt;integrated into any kind of data binding framework. To clarify: WSDL\n&gt; &gt;more or less depends upon XML Schema. That means that if you figure out\n&gt; &gt;a way to map XML Schema into your language (as many languages have done\n&gt; &gt;-- at least for simple stuff) then you can generate wrapper classes that\n&gt; &gt;know how to serialize and deserialize themselves &quot;for free&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does this matter for a dynamic language, though?  You could just\n&gt; return XML-marshalled objects of whatever type, agreeing on the DTD\n&gt; beforehand, and let the chips fall at runtime.\n\nIt is nice to know when you see the XML whether it should be treated as\na struct or array, integer, string or boolean. The schema can tell you\nthat -- otherwise you need to treat all child nodes as a string (in case\nyou happen to have repeated elements) and all attributes as &quot;just\nstrings&quot;.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
