HATEOAS seem to be key, but how do you document the =\r\n \n&gt; relationship between the resources linked? Most seem to use URI  \n&gt; tem=\r\nplates, but depending on them doesn&#39;t seem to be RESTful. WSDL/WADL  \n&gt; are=\r\n ok as specifications, but what do you guys think?\n&gt; \n&gt; Jan Vincent Liwanag=\r\n\n&gt; jvliwanag@...\n&gt;\n\nOk.\nHere is my take.\nReading all the other branch, you =\r\nwill see they refer to a RESTFull app, not to a service. Second, you can se=\r\ne almost no one likes WSDL.\n\nWell, here is the other side of the coin.\nFirs=\r\nt, we will need to define what a RESTFul web service is. Careful with that.=\r\n There has been much confusion, and people think a RESTFul web service is t=\r\nhat one that does not require SOAP and just needs to be called using HTTP. =\r\nThat is a wrong view.\n\nA service is a business functionality exposed. You c=\r\nan model that service as a resource. Being a process by itself, it can be i=\r\nmplemented replicated in different servers, of with indirection (the server=\r\ns you request to will forward that to the one that has the service implemen=\r\nted with several threads). That will allow scalability and other REST goals=\r\n.\n\nNow, being RESTFul means you are constrained to use the HTTP operations =\r\n(unless you don&#39;t want to use HTTP, you may want to use SMTP, but that is a=\r\nnother story). Simply put, you have one URL that is the origin. A get to th=\r\nat URI will bring a Hypertext document that you use to continue with the ne=\r\nxt step in the process. Most of the people that don&#39;t like WSDL nor SOAP, w=\r\nill use HTML. HTML was created for another purpose, but can be used here. S=\r\ntill, WSDL is a IANA defined content-type, and is an XML and fits also as a=\r\n Hypertext document. So, to me, it is perfectly fine to use!\n\nWSDL will tel=\r\nl you what are the endpoints (URLs to send messages), what is the format of=\r\n the messages, the interactions, even to the point of describing the HTTP v=\r\nerbs used (Version 2). \n\nNow, the bad way of using this is actually the way=\r\n everybody does: Reading the WSDL out of band and creating a static client =\r\nthat performs RPC. Wrong, that breaks several REST rules.\nYour client has t=\r\no be able to read WSDL on the fly, and perform the required operation, whic=\r\nh will be a get or a post of a message to a service. Should that be SOAP? n=\r\not really, if you implement correctly the service. If you use a point and c=\r\nlick tool, you will end up with all those REST rules broken.\n\nNow, your que=\r\nstion: Is WSDL a way to document? NO, it is not. \nWSDL is a description lan=\r\nguage for services. That means, you read it to process, not to document wha=\r\nt the process does. It is part of implementation, not a document out of ban=\r\nd.\n\nNow, you should not need documentation for REST execution, but you will=\r\n do for business case and construction. Let me explain:\nIf you are in a ban=\r\nking case, and you need to standardize the account IDs, then you will need =\r\nto create a glossary with types (data dictionary?) where all the semantics =\r\nof the application are described. Not the code interactions and URIs, but e=\r\nxplaining what an Account ID is, or how to handle an overdraft. See? This i=\r\ns business level.\n\nWhy is that needed? Because then you are talking the sam=\r\ne, and when the server asks for an accountID field, all clients know what i=\r\nt refers too on the fly! So you can automate most everything, and you effor=\r\nt is in dynamic construction and not static one. \n\nHope this helps.\nWilliam=\r\n Martinez Pomares\n\n\n"}}
