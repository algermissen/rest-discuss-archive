Take a simple\nexample of a customer resource with one or more address sub-resources.\nWe can POST an address representation to the customer resource, PUT on\nthe individual address resources to modify them or DELETE an address\nresource altogether.  In a particular situations, it may be important\nto later be able to say why that address was created or why was it\nmodified.  For instance, you may want to find out all the customers\nthat have moved 10 miles away and are still regular customers.  But if\nyou did a simple PUT on the address you won&#39;t know why it was changed\n- the person might have moved or the previous address might have been\nincorrect.\n\nThe only way I can think of to handle sending this piece of metadata\nwhen performing the operation is to include a custom HTTP header, like\nX-Reason or something similar that might be assigned specific codes.\nIt doesn&#39;t seem like it makes sense to put it in the body of the PUT\nbecause it&#39;s not a part of the resource you are\ncreating/changing/deleting.  Has anybody come across something like\nthis in the past?  Does the custom header sound like a good/bad idea?\n\nThanks,\nRich\n\n"}}
