Who knows what neat stuff we might be forgoing in the\nfuture by not using it?\n\nAlso, a practical issue is that any web server I&#39;ve used typically\nmakes it a lot easier to bind a chunk of code to query based URI than\nhierarchical based URI.  By that I mean that foo.com/bar?a=b, by\ndefault, gets processed by the processor bound to foo.com/bar, but you\noften have to jump through hoops (URI rewriting, etc..) to get\nfoo.com/bar/baz/ processed by the processor bound to foo.com/bar/.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
