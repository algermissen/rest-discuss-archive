What idioms are \n&gt; people using to add (and remove) items to the collection, or \n&gt; in general \n&gt; tell a server to relate two resources?\n&gt; \n&gt; An AtomPub post to collection approach doesn&#39;t seem to fit \n&gt; here, as I&#39;m not creating the document; it already exists.\n&gt; It feels naturally like a function spanning two resources\n&gt; as opposed to a uniform operation on a single resource.\n\nI think you can use AtomPub for this:\n\nPOST /collection/foo HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/atom+xml;type=entry\n...\n\n&lt;entry ...&gt;\n   &lt;content src=&#39;/document/bar&#39; .../&gt;\n   ...\n&lt;/entry&gt;\n\nThis will create an entry that looks a lot like a MLE entry. The client or\nthe server could even add a &quot;edit-media&quot; link if /document/bar is editable\nover HTTP. But, it wouldn&#39;t be a MLE because if deleting the entry didn&#39;t\nresult in the linked document (/document/bar) being deleted. Unfortunately,\nin AtomPub there is no way to tell whether an entry is a MLE or it just\nlooks like a MLE.\n\nRegards,\nBrian\n\n\n"}}
