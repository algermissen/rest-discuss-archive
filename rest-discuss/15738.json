I know you took this approach with both Prism and MEF; I think\ntaking the same approach here will once again lead you to your desired\nlocation. You mentioned that you are looking at API&#39;s for both client and\nserver. I think tools like Restfulie, RestClient, etc. do a great job of\nsolving the client issue. You need something simple and flexible that can\nfollow directions provided by another party (the server). REST clients need\nto act very similarly to human users. I think we have some fairly good\nsolutions here. No doubt they could and will be improved.\n\nOn the server side, however, we have a large hole, imho. I really like that\nRestfulie adds a fix for that hole in the form of hooking up a state machine\n(of sorts) to help drive the interaction by sending the next steps to the\nclient. I may be wrong, but I think Restfulie is the only one that does this\nnow. If you can help solve this problem, even if it is not required to use\nthe complete solution, you will have solved a major hurdle in applying REST.\nAgain, that is just my opinion.\n\nAside from the state machine, you need a simple way of applying the other\nconstraints. One solution seems to be making an enormous headway:\nSinatra&lt;http://www.sinatrarb.com&gt;.\nWe now have Denied &lt;http://denied.immersedcode.org/&gt; (Python),\nFlask&lt;http://flask.pocoo.org/&gt;(Python),\nExpress &lt;http://github.com/visionmedia/express/&gt; (JavaScript),\nJack&lt;http://jackjs.org/&gt;(JavaScript), and\nPadrino &lt;http://padrinorb.com&gt; (Ruby, built on top of Sinatra). In other\nwords, this *simple* DSL over writing web apps appears to be effective and\nis inspiring copycats. (We&#39;ve discussed Frank previously, which is my own\nattempt at doing this in F# for .NET.)\n\nIn turn these are all built upon similar, *simple*, to-the-metal server\ninterfaces: Rack &lt;http://rack.rubyforge.org/&gt; (Ruby),\nWSGI&lt;http://wsgi.org/&gt;(Python), and\nJSGI &lt;http://jackjs.org/jsgi-spec.html&gt; (JavaScript). (I&#39;m in the\nmiddle of something\nlike this &lt;http://github.com/panesofglass/frack&gt; for .NET.)\n\nYou&#39;ll note I highlighted *simple*. The biggest problem I&#39;ve had with WCF to\ndate is all the config. Sinatra and its kith put the config up front in the\ncode, which allows you to explicitly declare your intent. The server\ninterface handles the rest. (We could go further into the middlewares thing,\nbut this is already long.)\n\nI&#39;m not saying WCF has to go this way, but the number of players indicates\nthis is a useful approach and easy to pick up and use quickly. It&#39;s also\nextensible. Look at Padrino. You have Rack -&gt; Sinatra -&gt; Padrino. They stack\nnicely and keep a consistent interface no matter what level of complexity\nyou need for your app. The latest Changelog\nshow&lt;http://thechangelog.com/post/708173099/episode-0-2-7-padrino-ruby-web-framework&gt;indicated\nthat Padrino is fine handling large apps. That means that even\nfull enterprise environments can run on this stuff. (Of course, hard\nevidence would be nice. :) )\n\nTry starting there. Work outwards but try not to lose the simplicity. Find\nwhat works by building real applications that follow the REST constraints.\n\nCheers,\n\nRyan Riley\n\nEmail: ryan.riley@...\nLinkedIn: http://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanriley\nTwitter: @panesofglass\nBlog: http://wizardsofsmart.net/\nWebsite: http://panesofglass.org/\n\n\nOn Mon, Jun 21, 2010 at 3:58 AM, Glenn Block &lt;glenn.block@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; OK, I digested it now :-) (back from vacation)\n&gt;\n&gt; I agree pretty much with everything you said.
