It is business-level \nbut should be done quickly and automatically and the contents can be \nstereotyped.  It may require non-repudiation of receipt (e.g. digital \nsignature).  The contents would be archived in a transaction log, \nwhich I think should be part of the resource model.\n\nThere could be other complications, too, but I&#39;ll spare you for now.\n\n\n"}}
