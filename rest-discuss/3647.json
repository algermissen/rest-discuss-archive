I think I have a vague sense of what it is, \n&gt; but I&#39;m not sure I understand why its important.  I took a look at \n&gt; Fielding&#39;s thesis, but I didn&#39;t see much at all on visibility.\n\nWhat it said was pretty good though, even just this sentence;\n\n&quot;Visibility in this case refers to the ability of a component to monitor\nor mediate the interaction between two other components. &quot;\n\nI think that says it all.  Was there something in particular about that\ndefinition that you had trouble with?\n\n&gt; Can someone give me an example of why and how visibility is important \n&gt; (in REST).  I suspect that one of the examples will involve proxies, so \n&gt; if someone could give an additional example that&#39;d be even better.\n\nGiven the definition, providing an example that doesn&#39;t use an\nintermediary would be tough. 8-)\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.
