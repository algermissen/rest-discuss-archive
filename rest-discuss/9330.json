Stored does not &quot;very unambiguously&quot; mean &quot;replaced&quot;. With \n&gt;such abstract terms (&quot;store&quot;, &quot;replace&quot;, &quot;modify&quot;, &quot;update&quot; -- elsewhere \n&gt;in the spec, PUT is referred to as an &quot;updating&quot; method), only &quot;replaced&quot; \n&gt;very unambiguously means &quot;replaced&quot;.\n&gt;\n\nThere&#39;s some disagreement here, which stems from the wording of the RFC.  \nBut HTTP is not REST, if we are discussing the semantics of PUT in REST \nterms (generic interface) then store means replace in RFC 2616 just like \nSTOR means replace in RFC 765.\n\n&quot;REST does not restrict communication to a particular protocol, but it \ndoes constrain the interface between components, and hence the scope of \ninteraction and implementation assumptions that might otherwise be made \nbetween components. For example, the Web&#39;s primary transfer protocol is \nHTTP, but the architecture also includes seamless access to resources that \noriginate on pre-existing network servers, including FTP, Gopher, and WAIS. \nInteraction with those services is restricted to the semantics of a REST \nconnector.&quot;\n\nThis tells me that a REST connector must understand that the semantics of \nGET equal the semantics of RETR, APPE=POST, DELE=DELETE, LIST=OPTIONS and \nSTOR=PUT in order to meet the Uniform Interface constraint.  Implementing \nPUT with merge semantics may not go against RFC 2616 (although I don&#39;t \nthink that was the intent) but I don&#39;t see how it doesn&#39;t break REST to \ndo so.  FTP includes methods not included in the semantics of a REST \nconnector, just as HTTP PATCH has no merge corollary in FTP, but the \nmeaning of &quot;store&quot; is &quot;replace&quot; in both FTP and HTTP according to REST.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
