I don;t even have &quot;detractors&quot;, just pragmatic guys\nthat don&#39;t care muc=\r\nh about labels, they care about results - results\nmeaning time-to-market, f=\r\nollowing budgets and not technical things\nlike that. They even think I am a=\r\n fundamentalist regarding my\npreferred technologies REST, OSGi and SDO...\n\n=\r\nOf course, if you try to push REST in a all or nothing vies, you\nquickly fa=\r\nil. For instance, in my previous discussions with the team,\nwe reached the =\r\nconclusion that we had no need for concern with cache -\nand even me saying =\r\nthat we will benefit in the future in case we\ndecided to open the infrastru=\r\ncture to the exterior, wasn&#39;t enough to\nconvince then to spend 2 or 3 weeks=\r\n more on the project.\n\nSo we decided for no cache. Now imagine if there wer=\r\ne SOAP proponents,\nor anti-REST guys on the team. Following the purist poin=\r\nt of view that\nimply we were *not* implementing REST at all. So, if we aren=\r\n&#39;t\nimplementing REST, why not to just follow a well-know, market aware\nsolu=\r\ntion like SOAP?\n\nREST is not hard science, it&#39;s not even that difficult to =\r\nunderstand -\nI&#39;m not saying it&#39;s easy, but it&#39;s not that far of a paradigm =\r\nshift to\nunderstand as it is coming from a procedural paradigm to a\nobject-=\r\noriented one, or from this one to a declarative paradigm, or\nfrom a waterfa=\r\nll paradigm to a XP/Agile paradigm, or from a PDCA\nmethodology to a CMMI le=\r\nvel 5 methodology.\n\nTo try to present REST as hard science or a all-or-noth=\r\ning approach is\nto involve it in a veil of mysticism that is not compatible=\r\n to the\nnecessities of real life companies that have to choose and make\ntra=\r\nde-offs in many areas just to stay alive. And IT is one of that\nareas, IT i=\r\ns not above companies. And I just can&#39;t fecking understand\nwhy people want =\r\nto have such kind of approaches.\n\n\n2010/7/30 Suresh Kumar &lt;sureshkk@gmail.c=\r\nom&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; This is exactly what is worrying me. After looking at the presentat=\r\nion=A0most of my colleagues are airing the same views as Antonio. I am in t=\r\nhe middle of developing a RESTful system and now the detractors have got am=\r\nmunition. They say I will never be able to model all of the APIs using just=\r\n HTTP verbs and I will finally have to resort to custom verbs like Google h=\r\nas done.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2010/7/30 Ant=F3nio Mota &lt;amsmota@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t see=\r\n a company like Google, the biggest company on the net, born and raised on =\r\nthe net, and that can hire the best minds around, has problems in *getting*=\r\n it, and they were proven themselves many times not to be lazy or ignorants=\r\n.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Probably they see there are much more things on the net besides mak=\r\ning web sites and that allowing other parties to access their vast infrastr=\r\nucture and services in programmatically ways is very different than serving=\r\n HTML for browser/human consumption - which by the way is true not only for=\r\n the net but for even more for enterprises too.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Bottom line, doing th=\r\nings in the real world is not always compatible with theoretical purist con=\r\nsiderations and &quot;all-or-nothing&quot; views of the word... And of course, when s=\r\nomething is presented is such a way, pragmatic people have a tendency to go=\r\n away.=A0 Maybe Google is a good example how companies behave in the real w=\r\norld.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But this is just my opinion, of course...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On 30 July 2010=\r\n 09:45, Alexander Johannesen &lt;alexander.johannesen@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Mike Kelly &lt;mike@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Understanding and ap=\r\nplying REST correctly is hard, many people fail at both.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; What I fin=\r\nd scary, though, is that the Google engineers aren&#39;t getting\n&gt;&gt;&gt; it right (=\r\nor even half-right, perhaps more like a smidgen), and this\n&gt;&gt;&gt; stuff isn&#39;t =\r\n*that* hard.
