Pagaltzis wrote:\n\n&gt; No one said you should use the cookie to address the one of\n&gt; multiple shopping carts hiding behind the same URI. The only\n&gt; purpose of the cookie in Stefan’s scheme is to track the\n&gt; movements of users who have not identified themselves through\n&gt; HTTP Auth.\n\nGood point. I suppose I could swallow this provided the user still saw \nthe same pages and the site still worked if cookies were turned off. \n(That&#39;s not what I see in practice though.) In other words if the only \npurpose of the cookie were to gather knowlege about how users navigate \nthrough a site.\n\n&gt; It also allows you to associate a shopping cart resource created\n&gt; for a particular cookie’d anonymous user with a named user’s\n&gt; account if the anonymous user later decides to log in to proceed\n&gt; with his order. (Then you find HTTP Auth credentials and a cookie\n&gt; with an ID in the same HTTP request, so you know they belong to\n&gt; each other.)\n\nNo, that&#39;s not a good use of cookies. Here once again the shopping cart \nneeds to be identified by a visible URL, not a cookie.\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
