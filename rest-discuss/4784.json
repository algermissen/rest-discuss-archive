If you use &quot;/110022/220033&quot;, this implies that there\nare two resources, one &quot;owned&quot; (i.e. controls the lifecycle of) by the\nother.  For example, one of the consequences of this implication is that\na successful DELETE on /110022 would be expected to also remove\n&quot;/110022/220033&quot;.\n\nURI hierarchy is for, well, hierarchical relationships, and x/y isn&#39;t.\nYou could certainly do it, but I think you&#39;d eventually run into\nproblems.  Relative URI semantics would certainly be weird.\n\n&gt; &gt; GET /location?id=12345\n&gt; \n&gt; Query strings are best avoided, but not a big bad. (Most of the reasons for\n&gt; avoiding query strings aren&#39;t really valid, but a matter of assumptions made\n&gt; elsewhere by others making query strings somewhat disadvantaged).\n\nI think that&#39;s a bit strong.  I try to avoid using them, but only\nbecause you only get to use one per URI, and you never know when you\nmight need to add some parameters to one.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
