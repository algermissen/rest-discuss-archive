Say my organization wants to create two\nservices that relate to one another, a generic person service and a\nstudent service. How do I avoid loops that cause troubles with version\nnumbers?\n\nA timeline:\nv1 person released, links to v1 student\nv1 student releasted, links to v1 person.\ntime passes...\nv2 person released, links to v1 student\ntime passes...\nv2 student released, links to v2 person.\n\nNow a client can get a v2 student, link to a v2 person and then link\nback to a v1 student.\n\nHas anyone had problems with this type of mismatch? Anyone see clean solutions?\n\n-miles\n\n"}}
