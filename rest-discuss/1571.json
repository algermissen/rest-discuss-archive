Keep us informed about progress and remember to use us as a\nresource if you need ideas.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; Anyway, I&#39;m getting to my point.  We needed some libraries to do\n&gt; automatic marshalling of objects from the XML.  Guess what libraries do\n&gt; that?  You got it:  SOAP.  SOAP libraries will take objects in your\n&gt; language and serialize to XML, and back again.  And there are SOAP\n&gt; libraries for C++ (we are using gSOAP with pretty good results).\n\nThe ironic thing is that the SOAP world is moving away from the SOAP\nserialization and moving to XML Schema-based mappings. But you are right\nto use what works today and SOAP serialization works in many languages\ntoday.\n\n&gt; ...  We\n&gt; have a single method call invoked via SOAP, sync(), that exchanges\n&gt; objects wrapped in either a GET, PUT, or DELETE.  We are essentially\n&gt; emulating HTTP inside our objects being passed around with SOAP.\n\nInteresting. It&#39;s too bad you have to emulate HTTP though. One of the\nthings we have to push SOAP, WSDL and XML Schema implementors on is\nmodularity of implementations. You should be able to send the data over\nHTTP and then just hand the string to an object that deserializes it.\nThe SOAP serialization should never have been bound (either in the\nspecifications nor in the implementation) to the SOAP *protocol*.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
