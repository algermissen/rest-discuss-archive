Independent evolvability of components can only\nbe achieved if the client is prevented from knowing what exactly\nwill happen as the result of its requests. If it knows, then client\ndevelopers build into the system an expectation of the server\nimplementation that simply will not hold true over time.  Likewise,\na server doesn&#39;t understand why a client has requested X or what\nsequence of requests will come next -- it just knows the current\nintention of the client as expressed in the message.\n\nDo you think that strong typing is good for a distributed system\nthat crosses organizational boundaries?\n\n&gt; Further possible interpretations include deleting an /instance/ of part\n&gt; 00345 from the current inventory and deleting part 00345 from the\n&gt; catalogue as a whole. OTOH, the semantics of DELETE /parts/00345 is\n&gt; bothclear and unambiguous;  deleting the resource identified by the \n&gt; URI.\n\nWhat makes you think that /parts/00345 is not a query for part\nnumbers that contain the string &quot;00345&quot;?  Did the server tell you?\n\nAll servers have an infinite resource space (if we ignore URI length\nlimitations of some components).  Some of those resources will allow\nDELETE and others will not.  When I write a server application, the\nresources that I want to be authorable are a very small subset of\nthose that are GETable.  If you try to author a negotiated, query,\nor computed resource, then I give the client an appropriate error or\nredirect to the source resource.  Naturally, the source resource\nis defined such that the client&#39;s intent can be unambiguously\nexpressed via an HTTP method.\n\nIn interface design, if you don&#39;t want users to push a button, then\nplacing a big note next to it that says &quot;Don&#39;t push this button&quot; is\nnot a good solution.  It is better to just remove the button.\n\nIn REST, a client only expresses an intent within a message.\nA server is given leeway (within the scope of the method semantics)\nto choose a response that fits the nature of that resource.\nIt doesn&#39;t need to satisfy every request with a successful response.\n\nPeople who are used to distributed file system protocols get\nvery worried by HTTP, but it works just fine.  You just have to\nrelax and leave the details to late binding.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
