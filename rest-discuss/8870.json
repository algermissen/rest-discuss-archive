Verbs in a URI might be a bad smell, a very bad\n&gt;smell, but there&#39;s nothing RESTful or unRESTful about them. What matters is\n&gt;which verb counts: the method verb (in the case of HTTP, GET, PUT, &c.) or the\n&gt;one in the identifier. A URI is just an identifier for a resource, and as long\n&gt;as clients are able to treat it as such, there&#39;s no problem with having\n&gt;anything it it.\n&gt;\n\nIt only smells bad if you insist &quot;transform&quot; is a verb.  I see it as \nsynonymous with &quot;channel&quot; -- which is a noun.  It makes sense to me as the \nconsumer of a service which has a variety of output transformations for any \ngiven resource.  Since the query doesn&#39;t change, only the representation, \nand since it&#39;s optional I see this as a valid use for URI parameters.\n\nUgly or not.  ;-)\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
