Therefor=\r\ne:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://myserver/host/blueprints/ \n&gt; MindTouch.Dream.Tutorial.EightB=\r\nallService?dream.out.format=3Djsonp\n&gt; \n&gt; Does not retrieve a different form=\r\nat of the resource at:\n&gt; \n&gt; GET http://myserver/host/blueprints/ \n&gt; MindTou=\r\nch.Dream.Tutorial.EightBallService\n&gt; \n&gt; It retrieves a different resource. =\r\nIn other words, my understanding  \n&gt; of the HTTP spec&#39;s use of the term &quot;re=\r\nsource,&quot; and also Roy&#39;s use of  \n&gt; it in his thesis, gives no special meani=\r\nng to a question mark in a URI.\n&gt; \n&gt; I do exactly what you are describing, =\r\nbecause the user trying to  \n&gt; figure out our information architecture from=\r\n the URIs may indeed  \n&gt; apply special meaning to that question mark. (In m=\r\ny model for URI  \n&gt; design, the part of the URI left of the question mark d=\r\nefines a  \n&gt; conceptual thing from the user&#39;s perspective, but not a resour=\r\nce from  \n&gt; the HTTP or REST perspective.) So I think it makes sense to do =\r\nwhat  \n&gt; you&#39;re doing from a usability perspective, but my feeling is your =\r\n \n&gt; article may be inaccurate when it says you can apply query parameters  =\r\n\n&gt; to a URI to get a subset or different format for a single resource.\n\nI&#39;m=\r\n not sure I&#39;m following your point.  Are you saying I could express\nit bett=\r\ner without using the term &#39;resource&#39;?  But what should it be\ncalled then?\n\n=\r\nLet&#39;s look at the following use case (for Dream):\n1) we have a URI that poi=\r\nnts to an XML document (e.g.\nhttp://server/recipes)\n2) doing a GET on this =\r\nURI gives us the document verbatim\n3) doing a GET?dream.out.format=3Djsonp =\r\ngives us the document in a\ndifferent representation (sending &#39;Accept: appli=\r\ncation/json,\ntext/javascript&#39; should trigger the same conversion)\n4) doing =\r\na GET?dream.out.select=3D/list/entry[author=3D&#39;Julia Child&#39;]\ngives us the X=\r\nML sub-document that matches the xpath expression\n\nI would say that #2-#4 a=\r\nll refer to the same &quot;resource&quot;, but chose to\nrepresent it in different way=\r\ns.\n\nIf I understood you correctly, you are stating the\n&quot;http://server/recip=\r\nes&quot; and\n&quot;http://server/recipies?dream.out.format=3Djsonp&quot; identify two diff=\r\nerent\nresources, because they are different URIs.  Is that correct?  And if=\r\n\nyes, is there a less strict interpretation that would weaken this\nequality=\r\n relationship to only apply to the scheme, authority, and path\ncomponents o=\r\nf the URI (i.e. excluding user name, password, path\nparameters, query param=\r\neters, and fragment)?  I think such an equality\nrelationship would be usefu=\r\nl and feel intuitive.  And would certainly\nbe deserving of a name by which =\r\nit could be referred to.\n\n\n- Steve\n\n--------------\nSteve G. Bjorg\nhttp://ww=\r\nw.mindtouch.com\nhttp://www.opengarden.org\n\n\n"}}
