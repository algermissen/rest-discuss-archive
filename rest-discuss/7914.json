At Roy&#39;s request there&#39;s going\nbe a name change to make it less &quot;Java API For REST&quot; to something less\nall-embracing, I dont know what, maybe\n&quot;Java-API-to-keep-Java-Relevant-after-WS-*-failed&quot;\n\nGiven that sun&#39;s RI will be in glassfish, there&#39;s no financial value\nin keeping the TCK secret, so with any luck it will be open, and\nhosted on java.net .If it is fully open, then everyone can\nparticipate.\n\nJustin Erenkrantz is probably going to be apache lead, with various\nhangers on. Craig Russel (Tomcat) , Dims (Axis2), maybe me and dan\ndiephouse. I am still trying to decide how much copious free time it\nmerits.\n\n-steve\n\n-------- Original Message --------\nSubject: JSR-311 : that &quot;REST&quot; stuff that Roy keeps carrying on about...\nDate: Sat, 17 Feb 2007 06:56:46 -0500\nFrom: Geir Magnusson Jr.\nTo: jcp-open\n\n :)\n\nLast night, Sun informed the EC regarding the changes made to title\nand package name.\n\nI voted yes this morning with the comment :\n\n&quot;The ASF thanks the spec lead for making the changes to the title and\npackage name as noted in a mail to the EC on 2/16/07 - this was a key\nrequirement for us.\n\nWe&#39;d also like to encourage the spec lead to consider creating the\nsoftware portion of the TCK as open source software, allowing\ncommunity participation in designing as well as implementing the\ntests.  There is successful precedent for this, and it wouldn&#39;t\nnecessarily put compatibility of independent implementations nor the\nspec leads ability to command support or other revenue at risk if\nthis path was chosen.\n\nFinally, we strongly urge the spec lead to &quot;utilize&quot; rather than\n&quot;leverage&quot; an open source development model for this JSR, to\nencourage as much participation from the community as possible - the\ncommunity has a tremendous amount of experience using this\narchitectural model, and it behooves the spec lead to take advantage\nof known best practices.&quot;\n\n"}}
