=A0Is there some alternate registry for the\n&gt; Web that=\r\n I&#39;m not aware of? =A0If your media type isn&#39;t registered, and\n&gt; you&#39;re sen=\r\nding it over the Web, you&#39;re not even _attempting_ to be\n&gt; RESTful.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n To the &quot;sufficient&quot; question: if I have a document that I return as\n&gt;&gt; XML=\r\n (application/xml), what really matters to the consumer of that\n&gt;&gt; document=\r\n - can I associate a schema with the document?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; That doesn&#39;t make you=\r\nr messaging self-descriptive, because you&#39;re\n&gt; requiring introspection to d=\r\netermine the nature of the document. =A0I\n&gt; need to know the nature of the =\r\ndata by looking at the headers, not\n&gt; (perhaps) unzipping your content and =\r\nsniffing it first -- application/\n&gt; xml is *not* self-descriptive, as has b=\r\neen (correctly) pointed out on\n&gt; this list a hundred times...\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If it=\r\n isn&#39;t, even though the media type in use is well-defined and\n&gt;&gt; registered=\r\n with IANA, absent some form of schema (DTD, XML Schema,\n&gt;&gt; RelaxNG), the c=\r\nlient I wrote really cannot assume that the meanings\n&gt;&gt; are the same.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; No, self-descriptiveness does not require introspection of the content\n&gt; =\r\nto determine its processing model, it&#39;s dependent on registered media\n&gt; typ=\r\ne identifiers. =A0If I send XHTML as text/plain, you need to treat it\n&gt; as =\r\ntext/plain, not introspect it and determine that its schema means it\n&gt; shou=\r\nld be treated as XHTML -- that&#39;s sniffing, and sniffing has nothing\n&gt; to do=\r\n with REST.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As to the necessary question: =A0Was the &quot;Atom&quot; specifi=\r\ncation any less\n&gt;&gt; valid and self-describing the day before it was register=\r\ned with IANA\n&gt;&gt; than it was the day after? =A0It was self-describing before=\r\n and after.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; No, it was not. =A0Identifiers that aren&#39;t listed in *an=\r\ny* registry can&#39;t\n&gt; *possibly* meet Roy&#39;s definition of self-descriptivenes=\r\ns:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Self-descriptive means that the type is registered and the registry=\r\n\n&gt; points to a specification and the specification explains how to process\n=\r\n&gt; the data according to its intent.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Before Atom&#39;s identifier was regis=\r\ntered in IANA, it was registered...\n&gt; where? =A0If the identifier isn&#39;t in =\r\na registry, then it can&#39;t point to a\n&gt; specification, so it can&#39;t *possibly=\r\n* meet Roy&#39;s definition.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The internet has few baked in central cont=\r\nrol points - DNS might be\n&gt;&gt; the only one, really - even with respect to RE=\r\nST, we have a\n&gt;&gt; combination of standards organizations including the IETF,=\r\n W3C, IANA,\n&gt;&gt; and OASIS that all contribute &quot;standards&quot; to help the web fo=\r\nrm.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; None of which aren&#39;t recognized by the IANA registry, which is a=\r\n\n&gt; registry, not a standards body. =A0Merely a means to point identifiers t=\r\no\n&gt; descriptive documents, published by *any* entity that claims to be\n&gt; re=\r\nleasing a &quot;standard&quot; by the entity&#39;s own (and not IANA&#39;s) definition.\n&gt; Cou=\r\nld the bar *be* any lower?\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If China, with its hundreds of millions =\r\nof internet users, decides\n&gt;&gt; that it can&#39;t be bothered to register a media=\r\n type with IANA, yet it\n&gt;&gt; could easily be that *every* relevant Chinese cl=\r\nient of that\n&gt;&gt; media-type might readily understand it. =A0That sounds like=\r\n a feature\n&gt;&gt; of the internet, not a bug.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I have no problem with tha=\r\nt. =A0However, in _reality_ there is no\n&gt; alternate registry to IANA, not h=\r\nere, not in China, not anywhere on the\n&gt; planet. =A0So discussions about th=\r\neoretical alternatives to IANA are just\n&gt; that -- theoretical. =A0On the We=\r\nb, today, there exists only the IANA\n&gt; registry, therefore there is no othe=\r\nr means to meet Roy&#39;s requirement:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Self-descriptive means that the typ=\r\ne is registered and the registry\n&gt; points to a specification and the specif=\r\nication explains how to process\n&gt; the data according to its intent.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Su=\r\nre, if the Chinese alternative to IANA comes along, it would be a\n&gt; legitim=\r\nate registry for meeting the self-descriptiveness constraint.\n&gt; But, here&#39;s=\r\n a list of *actual* registries which *exist* today on the\n&gt; Web:\n&gt;\n&gt; IANA\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Sure, alternatives are possible, but pragmatically, that&#39;s _all_ there\n&gt;=\r\n is. =A0Even if there were some other registry, the wording of RFC 2616\n&gt; w=\r\nould still &quot;discourage&quot; its use.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I also like to think that REST mak=\r\ne sense to think about in the\n&gt;&gt; context of enterprise software. =A0So to m=\r\ne, the question is,\n&gt;&gt; &quot;self-describing, but for what scope?&quot; =A0Maybe this=\r\n is a small scope,\n&gt;&gt; such as the software my company writes, and all of ou=\r\nr customers.\n&gt;&gt; Yet, my company can then get the benefits of following a RE=\r\nSTful\n&gt;&gt; architecture.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; If you&#39;re sending HTTP over the Internet, the=\r\nn potential participants\n&gt; in the communication include folks beyond your o=\r\nr your partners&#39;\n&gt; organizational boundary. =A0If your identifier is opaque=\r\n, then these\n&gt; intermediaries can&#39;t be participants, but merely dumb router=\r\ns, which is\n&gt; the result we&#39;re presumably trying to avoid by using REST in =\r\nthe first\n&gt; place.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Now, can anyone come back with a solid, convin=\r\ncing argument that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; this is not the case?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully, the abo=\r\nve did that.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Not even close. =A0You&#39;ve failed to do anything but spe=\r\nculate that maybe\n&gt; some alternative registry will emerge. =A0A valid point=\r\n, but moot, since\n&gt; no such alternative _has_ emerged. =A0Therefore, in ord=\r\ner to meet Roy&#39;s\n&gt; requirement for self-descriptiveness:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Self-descript=\r\nive means that the type is registered and the registry\n&gt; points to a specif=\r\nication and the specification explains how to process\n&gt; the data according =\r\nto its intent.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; There exist, on the Web, exactly ZERO legitimate altern=\r\natives to the\n&gt; IANA registry, in practice. =A0Where else are media type id=\r\nentifiers\n&gt; registered for anyone to look up their associated standards? =\r\n=A0Nowhere,\n&gt; severely restricting the options for meeting the constraint, =\r\nin\n&gt; practice.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To that end, I see REST as an aspirational endpoint.=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I say that myself, all the time. =A0However:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not going =\r\nto deny fellow architects the label of &quot;REST&quot; if, for\n&gt;&gt; example, they got =\r\neverything right, but used a few non-standard-IANA-\n&gt;&gt; registered media-typ=\r\nes for a few small portions of their application.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; If there&#39;s no inte=\r\nnt to standardize a type or register an identifier,\n&gt; then there&#39;s no effor=\r\nt being made at self-descriptiveness. =A0This isn&#39;t\n&gt; just a mismatch, this=\r\n is actively thwarting the goals of REST. =A0Using\n&gt; an unregistered identi=\r\nfier for an unstandardized type is only congruous\n&gt; with REST if there is a=\r\nn intent to change that situation -- what I&#39;m\n&gt; arguing against here is the=\r\n refusal to admit there&#39;s even a problem.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Some pages have links to =\r\nother pages, and some pages might be\n&gt;&gt; endpoints (with merely incidental l=\r\ninks, like &quot;back&quot;). =A0I suggest\n&gt;&gt; that in a RESTful world, the pages that=\r\n link to other pages should\n&gt;&gt; strongly favor standardized (and registered)=\r\n media types. =A0When you\n&gt;&gt; get to the &quot;endpoint&quot; pages that don&#39;t contrib=\r\nute to the hypertext\n&gt;&gt; state of an application (PDF, Flash, video), then t=\r\nhe media type is\n&gt;&gt; much more wide open, and it should be.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; No, REST =\r\nsays nothing about self-descriptiveness being optional, or\n&gt; more important=\r\n / less important based on resource type. =A0Self-\n&gt; descriptive messaging =\r\nis a constraint, and those who choose to ignore\n&gt; this _fact_ simply are no=\r\nt following the REST style, and should not\n&gt; call their results REST. =A0I =\r\nam opposed to attaching the REST label\n&gt; where no effort is being made to f=\r\nollow the style.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Of course, any good developer should reuse what is=\r\n already available,\n&gt;&gt; and appropriate. =A0On the other hand, given a hamme=\r\nr, don&#39;t turn\n&gt;&gt; everything into a nail. =A0Figuring out when to make a new=\r\n media type,\n&gt;&gt; and when to reuse an existing one might actually be an extr=\r\nemely\n&gt;&gt; difficult call.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; 100% agreed. =A0My argument is against the =\r\ncavalier usage of unregistered,\n&gt; unstandardized types without any mention =\r\nwhatsoever, and outright\n&gt; denial of the existence, of any constraint issue=\r\ns or tradeoffs\n&gt; associated with the practice. =A0The bar to registering an=\r\n identifier is\n&gt; purposefully low, yet folks act like it&#39;s an insurmountabl=\r\ne obstacle,\n&gt; then pretend it isn&#39;t required. =A0NOT REST!\n&gt;\n&gt; -Eric\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
