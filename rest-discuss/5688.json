I work on middleware at IBM. Suppose I\n&gt; used REST as my protocol for accessing data stored in a database.\n&gt;\n&gt; On the surface, looks like a good match but how do I use REST to make\n&gt; multiple updates in a single atomic operation? \nYou define a content format for updates so clients can send the update \nrecords to the server. This is what RSS/Atom provides for /fetching/ \nmultiple records. You then need to expose the resource (a txn manager?) \nwith a URI, and send the content there. \n\nActually your best bet is to use RSS/Atom as your content format.\n\n\n&gt; What about pulling bnewport and jackwilson, for example, in one RPC?\nSee above point about RSS/Atom.\n\n\n&gt; Looks like the REST stuff cannot deal with multiple records per server\n&gt; interaction and if performance doesn&#39;t matter than I could solve it\n&gt; using multiple RPCs but alas, thats rarely the case.\n&gt; There&#39;s also the atomic multiple update issue. I see lots of\n&gt; advantages for using REST as a data-client -&gt; data server protocol.\n&gt; How do I do transactions using REST? begin, updates, commit?\n\n&quot;REST stuff&quot; I would describe to someone dealing in &quot;TXN Stuff&quot; as \nrecord oriented because it deals in identifiers that denotate single \nresources rather than managers and monitors. Support for \ncollections/enumerations/queues is something you layer on top.  For HTTP \nspecifically you need a shared format and perhaps some extra methods and \nresponse codes. WebDAV and Atom have the most and best prior art in this \narea imo.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n\n"}}
