It&#39;s even likely that it&#39;s able  \nto connect to RESTful services (at least as long as they&#39;re using GET  \nand POST only; but I&#39;m just guessing). I&#39;m pretty sure that it can  \ne.g. also monitor a directory for incoming files.\n\nStandardizing on RESTful HTTP alone will provide a collection of  \nconnectable resources, but how you actually do this is up to you.\n\nSo in other words: The two seem to be orthogonal to me.\n\nBest regards,\nStefan\n--\nStefan Tilkov, http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/\n\n\n\nOn Aug 26, 2006, at 2:33 PM, Dave Pawson wrote:\n\n&gt; Has anyone had to defend/offer a RESTful approach against\n&gt; a proposed Biztalk setup for inter-system message passing.\n&gt;\n&gt; We have 50+ disparate systems which need to talk one to another.\n&gt; A M$ gold partner is proposing to install Biztalk in 6 months  \n&gt; (unlikely).\n&gt; I&#39;d like to contend that a RESTful approach would meet the comms\n&gt; needs with advantages.\n&gt;\n&gt; TIA\n&gt;\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Dave Pawson\n&gt; XSLT XSL-FO FAQ.\n&gt; http://www.dpawson.co.uk\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
