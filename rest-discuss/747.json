I admit that I\n&gt;think in terms of technology and not business. I just know from what I\n&gt;hear from business people that the technological problems are similar to\n&gt;more standard protocol problems.\n\nI also really like the grounding in real business examples - especially a \n&#39;complex&#39; message exchange like a purchase order and acknowledgment. My \ncurrent job is heavily into that at the moment as well.\nA tricky line to draw is whether when using HTTP, the HTTP request/respones \nmessages are exactly equivalent to business documents (a purchase-order in a \nPOST, and a purchase-order-ack in the response) or whether HTTP messages are \ndelivery vehicles and the business documents span http messages (a response \nto a POST is only a &#39;delivery acknowledgement&#39; and the purchase-order-ack is \ndelivered to the sender somehow else (notification, new request, etc.)\n\nI&#39;m using the approach of transferring business documents between queues \nusing http messages carrying soap formatted data, the http and soap \nresponses only talk about successfull delivery - the content of the messages \ndescribe the &#39;success/failure&#39; of the business transaction.\n\nmike\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nJoin the worldï¿½s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
