IOW, user  \n&gt; goes to a page, types in their desired subdomain, and... then  \n&gt; what?  How does a web app get the DNS updated?  (My experience  \n&gt; trying to do this has all been on Windows Servers in the past, so  \n&gt; it might be easy on *nix, I dunno.)\n\nThis is not a REST question. It&#39;s a DNS question.\n\nFor a DNS name to be resolvable it must be in DNS (ta daa!)\n\nSo you can either have a DNS that knows it always has to respond with\ndetails if the name matches a certain pattern; eg:\n\n   mike.schinkel.somedomain.com  CNAME  www.somedomain.com\n\nor you have a registration process where you create a record.\n\nEither is possible with one of the programmatic DNS servers such as\npdns. \n\nWhich you use depends, you need some guideliness, ARR!\n\n\nAlso, it&#39;s unrelated to what operating system you&#39;re using. This is a\nDNS issue not a unix or windoze issue.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
