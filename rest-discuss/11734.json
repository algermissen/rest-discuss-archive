Looking around the internet it \nseemed that the de facto way of doing this would be:\n\napplication/vnd.myformat+xml\n\nOr, just register &quot;myformat&quot; with IANA and have:\n\napplication/myformat+xml\n\nOne huge downside of this though is that my browser does not know how to \nrender application/myformat+xml.  So, my question to this list is, why \naren&#39;t MIME properties used to identify XML schema?  For example:\n\napplication/xml; schema=http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\n\nI tried this approach with Firefox and Safari and both browser ignore \nthe attribute and render the document as XML.\n\nWould there be any reason NOT to use and promote this approach other \nthan it goes against current de facto convention?  I blogged about this \na few months ago and have yet to receive a logical reason why this \napproach isn&#39;t superior:\n\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com/2008/03/05/restful-xml-content-negotitation/\n\nThanks,\n\nBill\n\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
