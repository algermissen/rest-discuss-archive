But of course, anything with\n&gt; &gt; identity can have a URI.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sure, but what&#39;s the point of the the &quot;with identity&quot;? Any *thing*, \n&gt; period, can have an identifier: &quot;with identity&quot; is completely redundant \n&gt; as you&#39;ve just agreed.\n\nIMO, it&#39;s just clearer language.\n\n&gt; The RFC 2396 text is misleading, because it suggests that the potential \n&gt; resources are a *proper* subset of the set of things, the proper subset \n&gt; which has identity as opposed to the subset which doesn&#39;t. That&#39;s close \n&gt; to gibberish IMO.\n\nI wouldn&#39;t say that.  It&#39;s just saying the same thing twice, since to\nonly say it once would look odd, ala &quot;a resource can be anything&quot;(?!).\n\nFollowups to uri@..., I suggest.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
