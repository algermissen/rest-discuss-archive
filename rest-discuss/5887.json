Fielding wrote:\n\n&gt;&gt; What you describe sound to me like the approach envisioned by the\n&gt;&gt; HTTP designers when they designed content negotiation, and in Roy\n&gt;&gt; Fielding&#39;s dissertation when he discusses REST. I would contest your\n&gt;&gt; statement, &quot;a client can easily get to the other format,&quot; and suggest\n&gt;&gt; that is the main usability problem with content negotiation as\n&gt;&gt; envisioned in the HTTP spec and REST.\n&gt;\n&gt; Whoa, I think this is a case of reading too much into my dissertation.\n&gt;\nSorry about that. It is the HTTP/1.1 spec that uses human language as  \nan example in several places when talking about content negotiation.  \nAnd it was rest-discuss, not your dissertation, where I kept having  \nthat message reinforced in the context of REST. In section 12 of the  \nHTTP/1.1 spec it says:\n\nNote: This is not called &quot;format negotiation&quot; because the alternate  \nrepresentations may be of the same media type, but use different  \ncapabilities of that type, be in different languages, etc.\n\nBut in your dissertation in 6.3.2.7, you actually point out the  \nusability problem I was trying to highlight:\n\nIn preemptive negotiation, the user agent tells the server what it is  \ncapable of accepting. The server is then supposed to select the  \nrepresentation that best matches what the user agent claims to be its  \ncapabilities. However, this is a non-tractable problem because it  \nrequires not only information on what the UA will accept, but also  \nhow well it accepts each feature and to what purpose the user intends  \nto put the representation. For example, a user that wants to view an  \nimage on screen might prefer a simple bitmap representation, but the  \nsame user with the same browser may prefer a PostScript  \nrepresentation if they intend to send it to a printer instead. It  \nalso depends on the user correctly configuring their browser  \naccording to their own personal content preferences. In short, a  \nserver is rarely able to make effective use of preemptive negotiation...\n\n&gt; Huh, that is getting to be a FAQ.  I have no idea why people can&#39;t see\n&gt; the second and third link on the top page\n&gt;\n&gt;    http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm\n&gt;\n&gt; that point to the two PDF editions.  *shrug*\n&gt;\nWell, I&#39;ve looked at that page several times and didn&#39;t notice it. It  \nlooks a bit like the preface, and I think my eyes quickly moved to  \nthe table of contents looking for the &quot;good stuff.&quot; I&#39;ve found if you  \ndon&#39;t make something big, red, and put it right in the center, even  \nregular users may not notice it. You might want to put a PDF icon  \nnext to it, and move it over to the right so it doesn&#39;t look like the  \npreface material that people might tend to ignore.\n\n&gt; Mobile devices usually have a different set of interesting\n&gt; transitions (links), different artwork, and often different content.\n&gt; I usually treat them the same way as different languages.  Note that,\n&gt; like the home page above, the &quot;cool URI&quot; entry points that get\n&gt; published on other sites/email/papers are all negotiated, but result\n&gt; in a redirect to the language+device view of preference.\n&gt;\nThanks for the advice. It makes sense. My one uncertainty is on the  \nutility of entry points that only redirect, because I&#39;m not sure how  \nmany people will ever go there. Since everyone who goes there gets  \nredirected elsewhere, they will probably link to one of the target  \npages, not the entry point. So far I&#39;ve been thinking of having a  \ndefault form of the content at what you might otherwise use as the  \nentry point, and then include on that page a menu of links to the  \nother forms.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nEditor-in-Chief\nArtima Developer\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n"}}
