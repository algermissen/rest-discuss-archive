I claim there&#39;s no difference at all between options two\n&gt; and three, as at least from a REST perspective there&#39;s no difference\n&gt; between a query parameter and a file extension.\n&gt; \n&gt; I wonder why you&#39;d disagree?\n&gt; \n\nBecause this is a common misconception that arises from the notion of\nURI opacity.  REST&#39;s notion of opaque URIs does not somehow override RFC\n3986, which transparently declares quite some difference between path\nand query.  Roy would say, &quot;[Q]uery is not a substitute for\nidentification of resources.&quot;\n\nhttp://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven#comment-720\n\nJust think about how any httpd handles incoming requests.  If the query\nis being used as a filename extension (violating the Identification of\nResources constraint), then you&#39;d have some processing to do in order\nto attach the query data to the path data before continuing.  Using a\nfilename extension requires no such query processing at the server.\n\nSo clearly, they are not the same.  Since URIs are opaque, there is no\nway for an intermediary to determine that the query is being mis-used\nas a filename extension.  It is well known that intermediaries tend not\nto cache responses to requests containing queries.  The use of a\nfilename extension as a filename extension is well understood by\nintermediaries, whereas using a query as a filename extension is not.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
