Bottom\nline, end of story.  This is another half-ass Don Box swipe at HTTP, an\nattempt to fool the fools into thinking that there&#39;s something wrong with\nHTTP.  &quot;Oh, yeah, of course it sucks for transactions, because we can&#39;t keep\na connection open.  Oooh, shit, HTTP sucks!&quot;\n\n&gt;&gt; I guess that means that e.g. long-duration HTTP sessions, etc. don&#39;t work\neither.  We&#39;ve been fooling ourselves all this time.\n\nOkay, on this I agree (if I understand your point): there&#39;s nothing about\nthe HTTP protocol per se the rules out long term transactions - and even if\nthe practical support of the protocol demands that connections time out in\ncertain configurations (e.g., if you&#39;re using a proxy server) there are\npatterns of HTTP use that would have the same effect.\n\nI guess my follow up question would be then: are these patterns of use being\ncodified anywhere by the REST community?\n\nIt seems to me one of the reason, among others, why SOAP is gaining traction\nis that support for problems like these (e.g., routing, security) are going\nthrough some level of standardization.  See ws-security [1], ws-routing [2].\nAnd are getting built into packages solutions.\n\nBy the way, I heard Box say that he thought that ws-routing is one of the\nmore interesting/important web services specs under development right now.\n\n&gt;&gt; PS - if you sense some rancor here, go reread Don&#39;s opus.  There&#39;s\nabsolutely no doubt at all that he&#39;s  gunning for HTTP, and there&#39;s very\nlittle doubt (in my mind anyway) why.\n\nWell it certainly seems like they&#39;d be happy to gain control of the\ninteroperability protocols again if that&#39;s what you&#39;re getting at.\n\n[1] http://msdn.microsoft.com/ws/2002/04/Security/\n[2] http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnglobspec/html/ws-routing.asp\n\n\n"}}
