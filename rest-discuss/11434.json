By requiring that you effectively\ndisenfranchise all those like myself who are not paid to participate and\nthus have only a limited amount of time to be involved. \n\nThat is an effect of your process; was that intended?  \n\nAnyway, so please consider me to be one of the &quot;authors and implementors&quot;\nyour process refers to.\n\n&gt;&gt; Why isn&#39;t the current form submission mechanism, with a redirect on the\nserver-side, not acceptable? \n\nTwo main reasons:\n\n1.) Use cases where the person writing the form is not technically in\ncontrol of the server and where Javascript is unavailable and the percentage\nof places where these use-cases exist are growing rapidly because of social\nmedia and content management systems.\n\n2.) Performance best practices frown on it: \nhttp://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#redirects \n\nSnell&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; FYI... I&#39;ve put together a quick prototype example [1] of a html\nform \nSnell&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; using a URI Template [2].  The processing of the template is\nperformed \nSnell&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the onsubmit event of the form.\nIan&gt;&gt; This is great -- why is it not enough?\n\nI keep saying &quot;where Javascript is unavailable and the percentage of places\nwhere these use-cases exist are growing rapidly because of social media and\ncontent management systems&quot; but you are not acknowledging. Are you\nimplicitly discrediting that as a concern, or have you missed those comments\nof mine?\n\n&gt;&gt; Because it adds significant complexity to the browser platform, without \nreally adding new functionality.\n\nSignificant? Srsly?  Seems to me we are talking about simply a URI Template\nvariable substitution.  Since it is *easy* to do in Javascript how can it be\nadding &quot;significant complexity&quot; to the browser platform?  It seems your two\npoints are in direct contradiction; how are they not?\n\nSo, may I ask, who are the representatives of the browser platforms who\ncould give their feedback on this matter?\n\n&gt;&gt; Why would scripts preclude accessibility? \n\nSee Al Gilman excellent response.\n\n&gt;&gt; And are you really expecting search engines to fill in forms that would\nuse templates? \n\nYES!!  Why would they not, if they could?\n\n&gt;&gt; Something that can&#39;t be done without the feature. \n\nWhen the use-case is no access to the server and only Javascript then this\nuse-case can&#39;t be done.\n\nWhen the members of the web team say NO REDIRECTs on performance grounds, it\ncan&#39;t be done.\n\n&gt;&gt; Something that allows authors to write applications that make users say\n&quot;wow!&quot;, which they can&#39;t do today. \n\nURI Templates in forms would make core devs on content management systems\nand frameworks go WOW once they realized what it can empower.  I&#39;m\nsoliciting such feedback on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/mikeschinkel/status/985784895\n\n&gt;&gt; There are many many gaps, why is this an important one to fill?\n\nFor the reasons given and because it makes URL templates declarative.\n\n&gt;&gt; TBL did exactly what we&#39;re suggesting you do -- he wrote his own spec, \nwrote his own client, and wrote his own server, and put it out there. He \ndidn&#39;t wait for a Standards Process to give him a stamp of approval.\n\nAnd TBL worked for CERN, an organization that allowed lots of time to pursue\nsuch interests. I instead am a working web developer and can&#39;t afford to go\noff on such paths, I just need things to work better for which it has become\nclear this standards process is a huge impediment.\n\n&gt;&gt; Why not just provide links, or use a redirect?\n\nReasons already given. \n\n&gt;&gt; What if the URI you have to compute is more complicated than just\nsubstitution, like some parts being dependent on others, or needing\ncalculation, or whatnot?\n\nHTML doesn&#39;t any never will handle 100% of use-cases; that&#39;s actually one of\nthe things that is good about it; it forces people to deal with constraints.\nUnfortunately the constraints currently in place cause web developers to\nfrequently create URLs that machines can easily understand but that are\nforeign to most humans. Adding URI Templates would loosen those contraints\nand give web developers the ability to create human friendly URLs in a more\nrobust manner (i.e. not requiring Javascript.)\n\nURI Templates would be no different than HTML, i.e. it would have\nconstraints. Handing 90% is 90% better than we have right now.\n\n&gt;&gt; What if the user types something that isn&#39;t supported by weather.com,\nlike \nthe string &quot;x&quot;?\n\nHTTP handles that elegantly; 404. \n\n&gt;&gt; Also, why can&#39;t you just do:\n&gt;&gt;   &lt;form method=&quot;get&quot; action=&quot;http://www.weather.com/search/enhanced&quot;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;where&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Check Weather!&quot;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   &lt;/form&gt;\n\nSo obvious it hurts: Because I don&#39;t current control Weather&#39;s server and\nthey have no http://www.weather.com/search/enhanced URL.\n\n&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t really follow what you&#39;re saying here. I see no practical\ndifference between URI templates and normal forms in terms of Google\ncrawling the results.\n\n&quot;Normal forms?&quot;  Google is not going to try to parse out javascript code\nthat is custom to a website nor &quot;user added&quot; form attributes.\n\nAlso, adding a template attribute to a form element w/o it being in spec\ncauses it to fail validation; I thought validation was a holy grail but you\nare instead suggesting we write HTML that doesn&#39;t validate?  Why only argue\nfor validation when it is convenient?\n\n&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t think anyone is denying that it is useful in certain cases. The\nquestion is whether it will be used widely enough to make it worth it.\n\nWhat&#39;s more important; critical in 5% of cases or nice-to-have in 50% of\ncases?\n\n\n-Mike Schinkel \nhttp://mikeschinkel.com\n\n\n\n"}}
