I mean, if we&#39;re trying to stick to the specs,\n&gt; how about http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616- \n&gt; sec3.html#sec3.7 :\n&gt; &quot;Use of non-registered media types is discouraged.&quot; ?\n\nYou may be reading too much into that. Since that RFC was written, a  \nnumber of new types were introduced. Note that standardization happens  \nusually after a discovered need for interop.\n\n&gt; I think the Obasanjo article supports the idea that OpenSocial is a\n&gt; good approach - no coupling to specific URI schemes, and no client\n&gt; &quot;guessing&quot; either. And it&#39;s based on using the well-standardized\n&gt; (though not IANA-registered?) &#39;application/xrds+xml&#39; media type,\n&gt; rather than inventing a new media type. Same with some other\n&gt; well-designed RESTful API&#39;s that have been mentioned.\n\nPlease look at the JSON/XML examples - not the XRDS part.\n\nSubbu\n---\nhttp://subbu.org\n\n\n"}}
