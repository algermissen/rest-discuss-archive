However, for more complex services, the HTTP\nOPTIONS method would seem to be a viable candidate for providing\ninformation about what verbs are available for the resource, what\nparameters are required, and what other URIs provide related services.\n\nFrom HTTP RFC 9.2 :\n&quot;If the OPTIONS request includes an entity-body (as indicated by the\npresence of Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding), then the media type\nMUST be indicated by a Content-Type field. Although this specification\ndoes not define any use for such a body, future extensions to HTTP\nmight use the OPTIONS body to make more detailed queries on the\nserver. A server that does not support such an extension MAY discard\nthe request body.&quot;\n - http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html\n\nIf something like a RSDL really is necessary, the response body of an\nOPTIONS request seems like the place for it. The OPTIONS response\ncould also point you to related resources, either using extended\nheaders or something in the response body. For example:\n\nOPTIONS /queue\n - returns available methods: GET, POST\n - notifies of related resource: /queue/[id] with methods GET, PUT, DELETE\n\nHas something like this been explored previously?\n\n\nOn Fri, 18 Feb 2005 10:12:08 -0500, Josh Sled &lt;jsled@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, 2005-02-18 at 00:39, S.

You may do better to embrace\n&gt;    HTTP more completely rather than trying to be distinct from it.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4/ How do you handle method arguments, return-values and data-types?  I\n&gt;    don&#39;t think you can have RSDL without having RIDL; in fact I think\n&gt;    they&#39;re really one-in-the-same.\n&gt; \n&gt; 5/ The variability introduced by spec language like that of the bullet\n&gt;    point beginning with &quot;Listing a method that isn&#39;t...&quot; is a Bad\n&gt;    Thing; it only makes life more complicated.  I&#39;d propose:\n&gt;    &quot;The &lt;interface&gt; attribute of the &lt;method&gt; element is required.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; You make a vague slight against RDF in 1.1.2, but you should really take\n&gt; a deeper look at it; you&#39;re sharing a lot with it, both in semantics and\n&gt; syntax.\n&gt; \n&gt; You should also look at RDF Forms [2], which does something similar.\n&gt; \n&gt; [1] http://asynchronous.org/blog/archives/2005/02/11/amazons_restless_ws_api.html\n&gt; [2] http://www.markbaker.ca/2003/05/RDF-Forms/\n&gt; \n&gt; ...jsled\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; http://asynchronous.org/ - `a=jsled; b=asynchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b}`\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
