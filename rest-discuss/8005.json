If a &quot;RESTEasy&quot; application can&#39;t interoperate with  \na JSR311-based one, the reason is that they aren&#39;t (or can&#39;t be) used  \naccording to REST principles.\n\nI&#39;m certainly not defending this particular framework, but your  \nquestioning its value without even looking at the approach it takes  \n(and without knowing much about the Java space, as you explain later)  \nseems utterly pointless.\n\nStefan\n--\nStefan Tilkov, http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/\n\n\n\n"}}
