Regardless of the &#39;Basic&#39;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; a=\r\nuth-type being unsecure, why do so many systems use something else?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\nAs you suggest below, I believe it&#39;s the lack of a UI.\n&gt;\n&gt; My two cents: In=\r\n the systems I&#39;ve built, lack of UI is exactly the reason\n&gt; we&#39;re rejected =\r\nHTTP Auth. Two main problems:\n&gt; * usability: simple as it seems, the uname/=\r\npw dialog that the browsers\n&gt; present seems to stump naive users. There&#39;s n=\r\no feedback if you enter bad\n&gt; credentials (besides the dialog popping up ag=\r\nain), there&#39;s no help, there&#39;s\n&gt; no way to retrieve a forgotten password.\n&gt;=\r\n * branding/look&feel: no way to control the UI. So you can&#39;t make it look\n=\r\n&gt; like the rest of your app.\nMy biggest concern with HTTP Auth (as currentl=\r\ny implemented by browsers) is \nthat once you&#39;ve logged in, there is no way =\r\nfor the user to tell the browser \nto &quot;forget&quot; that username and password!  =\r\nYou have to close ALL browser \nwindows to get it to forget the authenticati=\r\non.\n\nWouldn&#39;t it be nice if the web browser had a statusbar icon (similar t=\r\no the \nlock for HTTPS) indicating that it was currently sending authenticat=\r\nion \ninformation with each request?  Clicking on this icon would allow the =\r\nuser to \n&quot;manage&quot; their current logins, including an easy way to logout fro=\r\nm a given \nsite (where logout simply means no longer sending authentication=\r\n \ninformation).\n\nFixing this problem would make HTTP auth usable by browser=\r\ns.  Of course, UI \nimprovements would be welcome.........\n&gt; Given configura=\r\nble client-side control of the auth UI, I think we would\n&gt; have happily use=\r\nd HTTP auth for almost all these apps.\nAgreed!   The server should be able =\r\nto return a simple HTML document as the \nentity-body of the HTTP 401 Unauth=\r\norized response.  Just need a standard way \nto inform the browser which fie=\r\nld is the username, and which is the password.\n\n-Andrew\n\n\n\n"}}
