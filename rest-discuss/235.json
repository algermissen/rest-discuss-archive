Just recognize that you&#39;re doing this,\n&gt; &gt; and don&#39;t try to pretend that you&#39;re doing HTTP behind the gateway\n&gt; &gt; or that will just cause more trouble.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; If I wanted to model the resource system as an addressable collection of\n&gt; messages, what would the HTTP requests and responses look like? Especially\n&gt; if those messages were literally HTTP request and response formats?\n\nBut they wouldn&#39;t be, past a certain point.  That point is the gateway.\n\n&gt; Like\n&gt; blindly logging all web server activity and having an analysis program\n&gt; consume those from disk via HTTP.\n\nErm, I thought you were doing this because you&#39;ve only got on way comms\nwith your resource?\n\nSure, you could log all messages by doing that, but in that case you&#39;re\nnot tunneling because the message are truly opaque.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
