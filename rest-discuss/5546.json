Consider that with such an\n&gt; &gt; assumption, one couldn&#39;t readily substitute another Web server\n&gt; &gt; and still have it meet the same expectation.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have been reading early threads about this POST issue but\n&gt; still couldn&#39;t grab the point yet. Do you mean when we send a\n&gt; self-descriptive request, since everyone (including\n&gt; intermediates) know its intend/semantic, therefore we can\n&gt; unambiguously expect an &quot;expected response&quot;? ;-)\n\nI don&#39;t understand this notion of &quot;expectation&quot; myself. When I do\na POST it&#39;s only because I&#39;ve just read something telling me that\ndoing so will achieve something I want to achieve (such as an HTML\nform accompanied by English text). That hypertext context suggests\nsome weak &quot;expectation&quot; at a high level, in terms of what I&#39;m\ntrying to accomplish, but my only expectation of the HTTP response\nis that it will *also* be hypertext and will also describe what\nhappened, hopefully in terms I understand. That is, the request\nitself doesn&#39;t need to describe any particular &quot;expectation&quot; at\nthe HTTP level because the response will be *self*-descriptive\nanyway. It might carry an HTML message telling me that some\noperation was performed and giving hyperlinks to related\ninformation, or it might redirect me to a URI such that GETing\nthat URI would return the same kind of message.\n\nAlso, though Josh&#39;s proposal of creating an intermediate resource\nas a result of the POST may feel weird from an RPC standpoint, it\nmakes total sense from a Web standpoint. If I were to build a\nportfolio analysis Web application, I certainly would provide some\nUI (involving lots of POSTs) to create and maintain portfolios\nwithin the application. Then some analytics about a particular\nportfolio would just be another subordinate resource, at, say,\n&lt;/portfolios/123/analytics&gt;. The HTTP interaction would be more\nlike this:\n\n== User ==\nSelects bookmark for portfolios app.\n== User-Agent ==\nGET /portfolios\n== Server ==\n200\n\n&lt;a href=&quot;/portfolios/123&quot;&gt;Joe&#39;s Portfolio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;/portfolios/354&quot;&gt;Bob&#39;s Portfolio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;/portfolios/523&quot;&gt;Ed&#39;s Portfolio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;form method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;\n&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; name=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;New Portfolio&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n== User ==\nClicks &quot;New Portfolio&quot; button.\n== User-Agent ==\nPOST /portfolios\n\nsubmit=New Portfolio\n== Server ==\n302\nLocation: /portfolios/42\n== User-Agent ==\nGET /portfolios/42\n== Server ==\n200\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Untitled Porfolio&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;form method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;\n&lt;... controls for editing the portfolio...&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;/portfolios/42/analytics&quot;&gt;Analytics&lt;/a&gt;\n== User ==\nClicks &quot;Analytics&quot; link.\n== User-Agent ==\nGET /portfolios/42/analytics\n== Server ==\n200\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Analytics for Untitled Portfolio&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;... etc. ...&gt;\n== end ==\n\nReplacing &quot;Web application&quot; with &quot;Web service&quot; and replacing\n&quot;User&quot; with &quot;software agent&quot; perhaps requires a more simplified\nand less ambiguous language than English, but I think this is a\nvery natural way to think about Web services design as well.\nNotice that the user in this example has bookmarked an initial\nresource and from there uses textual cues to decide what to do,\nand never constructs a URI or a GET or a POST, while the\nuser-agent simply follows the instructions from the server for\nconstructing appropriate requests. All the user-agent and any\nintermediaries need to &quot;know&quot; about each request is whather it is\nsafe to cache or to refresh without warning the user. Whether POST\nmeans &quot;append&quot; or &quot;process&quot; is totally irrelevant when your\nsemantic expectations are based on the hypertext context.\n\nCheers,\nJustin\n\n\n"}}
