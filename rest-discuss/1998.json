For example, I did a similar\nthing with the Amazon interface in order to obtain an &quot;$author&quot; from a book\ntitle, then pass that into a template called &quot;search-for-url&quot; in the Google\ntemplates which returns the first URL found for that author name. Granted,\nit&#39;s probabilistic, but it&#39;s just a simple demo.\n\n\n  &lt;xsl:import href=&quot;amazon.xsl&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;xsl:import href=&quot;google.xsl&quot;/&gt;\n\n  &lt;!-- ... get &quot;author&quot; from amazon ... --&gt;\n\n  &lt;a&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:attribute name=&quot;href&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;xsl:call-template name=&quot;search-for-url&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;xsl:with-param name=&quot;search-term&quot; select=&quot;$author&quot;/&gt;\n      &lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;\n    &lt;/xsl:attribute&gt;\n    &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;$author&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nWith Google&#39;s SOAP interfaces, I&#39;m basically cut off from doing this.\n\n\nBoth the Amazon and Google template use the XSLT document() function in\norder to call the service and obtain results.  I&#39;m not sure how that\nfunction\nwould react to an HTTP Authentication request, so I would ask that you allow\nkeys to be used in the query for the time being.\n\nI&#39;d be happy to share this work with anyone that is interested; just send me\nan\nemail. Thanks again.\n\n\n- Jeff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;borkazoid&quot; &lt;beau@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, July 27, 2002 5:44 AM\nSubject: [rest-discuss] Re: xoomle\n\n\n&gt; Actually, I had never heard of REST until Dave Winer posted that to\n&gt; scripting.com.
