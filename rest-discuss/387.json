I spent a couple days analyzing a\nbig problem created by the standard model (the problem being that using\ncallbacks to post event notifications opens large security holes) and proposed a\nsimple solution.  It does no good to say that large security problems don&#39;t\nmatter -- they do -- or to snipe at implications like reverse firewall traversal\nwhich (1) are based on incorrect understanding and (2) I didn&#39;t make.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
