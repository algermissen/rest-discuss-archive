So\nit wasn&#39;t about &quot;MS, Sun and IBM&quot;s goals, nor reformating REST.  \n\nI was hoping to hear more on the bridging of architectures from the non\nsoftware vendors, but didn&#39;t.  \n\nA great deal of the reason why there are 2 very different tools in the\ntoolbox is because nobody has provided joins between the tools.  Even when I\nhave different tools in the toolbox, sometimes they can have things in\ncommon to make it easier to use the essential parts of each tool.  Like\nhaving a metric to imperial conversion or tools with both units.  \n\nCheers,\ndave\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Alan Dean [mailto:alan.dean@...] \n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, June 12, 2007 2:54 PM\n&gt; To: orchard@...\n&gt; Cc: Steve Loughran; Rest List\n&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] Web of Services for Enterprise Computing\n&gt; \n&gt; On 6/12/07, Dave Orchard &lt;orchard@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s funny the way these things happen.

I really can&#39;t imagine MS, Sun and IBM \n&gt; accepting that the spec stack now built on top of SOAP should \n&gt; be unwound.\n&gt; \n&gt; Given that, is the REST community willing to reformat itself \n&gt; in the image of WS-* ? ... I imagine not.\n&gt; \n&gt; I look on them as two different tools in the box. Each has \n&gt; strengths and weaknesses. I speak as a professional \n&gt; developer, involved in &quot;web services&quot; in the most general \n&gt; sense for the better part of 7 years:\n&gt; from the pre-WS-* days of POX-over-HTTP, through to WS-* and \n&gt; REST. I implement both WS-* and RESTful services in my \n&gt; professional life - selecting technology according to the \n&gt; appropriateness to the task at hand.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t see the need for unification or &quot;bringing them \n&gt; together&quot;, any more than I look at a real-world toolbox and \n&gt; think to myself &quot;hmmm ...\n&gt; what I really want is a more hammer-like screwdriver.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Alan Dean\n&gt; http://thoughtpad.net/alan-dean\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
