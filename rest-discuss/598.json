I have stayed away from it because whenever I try to\n&gt; model the actual interactions using proxies I find an awkward fit in using\n&gt; proxies to do active work.  The syntax of a request to a proxy is slightly\n&gt; different than the syntax of a request to a normal host.\n\nBTW, if it wasn&#39;t clear, I wasn&#39;t actually suggesting that using an actual\nintermediary in this capacity.  Rather, I was suggesting that something like\nWD-Proxy&#39;s notification scheme be generalized so that the notification receiver is\ntopology-independent;  every Web application can in some sense be viewed as a\n&quot;cache&quot; for representations elsewhere, and the problem of maintaining current state\nin that cache can be aided by active cache invalidation.\n\n&gt; As a result the end\n&gt; application can&#39;t be a CGI script.  I don&#39;t advocate that implementations should\n&gt; only ever be CGI, but rather that it must be possible for implementations to be\n&gt; CGI.  I advocate this because of the huge boost to adoption that CGI enables --\n&gt; the backdoor is often the only door for new technology.\n\nHmmm.  Does it really matter?  After all, all we&#39;re doing is sending a message back\nto the client that says &quot;come and get it again.&quot;  There&#39;s no reason &quot;it&quot; can&#39;t be a\nCGI. Is there?  Clearly, we can&#39;t cache POST results, but...  (btw, thinking about\nthis using the proxy / cache control terminology does confuse the issue.  You&#39;re not\nreally proxying if you make the request yourself, obviously, and you&#39;re not really\ncaching something if you get it, look at it / use it for something, then toss it.)\n\n&gt; One-shots\n&gt; =========\n&gt;\n&gt; I haven&#39;t been able to think of a problem with one-shot notifications, and I\n&gt; have been able to think of advantages.  So I am a strong +1 for this.\n\nThis IMO is the real meat of the deal.  I think it&#39;s HUGELY advantageous.\n\n&gt; NOTIFY method\n&gt; =============\n&gt;\n&gt; I am strongly against new methods.  For one, they&#39;re about as un-REST as you can\n&gt; get.  For another, they make adoption a long, slow, painful process.  Any design\n&gt; that requires new methods will be adopted at tenth the pace of one that doesn&#39;t.\n&gt; If the HTTP Events spec ends up requiring new methods, I will almost certainly\n&gt; fork and make a version that enables implementations to avoid new methods.\n\nIn general I agree.  There are some &quot;pros,&quot; though.  I thought you&#39;d like this, as\nit does allow client implementations to support a *very* minimal protocol --- they\nonly need to accept NOTIFY on port 80.  IMO, that&#39;s cleaner than overloading\nstandard HTTP method (GET) and using an older and much laxer version of the HTTP\nspec.\n\n&gt; WD-proxy uses an orthogonal header for the request:\n&gt; proxy-option= &quot;notify&quot; | &quot;loging&quot; | log\n&gt;\n&gt; This is a really good solution.\n\nI think you need to read the spec, I don&#39;t think it does what you think. ;-)\n\n&gt; &gt; So just finished an afternoon reread of Ari Luotonen&#39;s book,\n&gt; &gt; hadn&#39;t looked at it in a couple of years;\n&gt;\n&gt; which book, Jeff?\n\nAri was head of server development at CERN back in the day, then ran proxy\ndevelopment at Netscape.  His book &quot;Web Proxy Servers&quot; [1] is one of the classics;\nit was released in about &#39;98.  A lot of the information is now out of date, but it&#39;s\nstill worth a read.  Note that it doesn&#39;t talk about WD-Proxy, but it does have a\ngreat explanation of the various age / freshness tradeoffs and algorithms.\n\njb\n\n[1] http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0136806120/\n\n\n"}}
