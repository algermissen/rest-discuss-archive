The generic interface allows your resource to be DELETEd\nby a variety of protocols, including HTTP.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I *think* this is what Roy was addressing when he wrote this:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Identifiers, methods, and media types are orthogonal concerns â€”\n&gt; methods are not given meaning by the media type. Instead, the media\n&gt; type tells the client either what method to use (e.g., anchor implies\n&gt; GET) or how to determine the method to use (e.g., form element says to\n&gt; look in method attribute). The client should already know what the\n&gt; methods mean (they are universal) and how to dereference a URI.&quot;\n&gt; \n\nAtom Protocol doesn&#39;t give any meaning to the PUT or POST method.  The\nclient only needs to know how to make PUT and POST requests -- it does\nnot need to know that Atom Protocol constrains POST to &#39;create&#39; and PUT\nto &#39;update&#39;, i.e. the client could care less that we&#39;re using Atom\nProtocol. The media type instructs clients to use POST to &#39;create&#39; and\nPUT to &#39;update&#39;. REST requires that hypertext be used to make these\ninstructions to the client explicit, so Atom Protocol has a REST\nmismatch.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
