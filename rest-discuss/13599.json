In principal I get the\ntheoretical difference, but I think the examples you give don&#39;t necessarily\nillustrate the point, and in one case confuses me.\n\nTaking Bill&#39;s credit card transaction example, if the client authorizes the\nserver to charge the credit card and a record of that charge is created,\nthis means that the number of resources on the server side will increase\nevery time a client authorizes a charge to its credit card.  What kind of\nstate is this, application or service?\n\nAlso looking at your pessimistic locking example, it seems to me that the\nrequirement to &quot;clean up&quot; locks on the server is not a necessary\nrequirement.  It should suffice to have the locks expire, and to have the\nserver ignore the presence of all expired locks.  It seems to me that this\ncould be done in a manner that would not require the server to remember the\nstate.\n\nDo you see why I am confused?  In reading your post, it seems that the\npessimistic lock example could be implemented in a style that would not\nbreak the guidelines you suggested.  It also seems that in the case of a\ncredit card transaction authorization, according to your example, that\nstoring it as a resource would be simply be an attempt to transfer what\ncould be considered trying to convert application state into service state.\n\nI am struggling with this concept, and would value any input you (or anyone\nelse) may have that would help to clarify this.\n\nOf course if the answer is simply &quot;restful statelessness means no server\nside database dummy&quot; then I completely understand.  I hope that isn&#39;t the\nanswer however. :)\n\nOn Wed, Sep 30, 2009 at 6:06 PM, Benjamin Carlyle &lt;\nbenjamincarlyle@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Bill,\n&gt;\n&gt; Here are mine: http://soundadvice.id.au/blog/2009/06/13#stateless\n&gt;\n&gt; :)\n&gt;\n&gt; Benjamin.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2009/9/22 Bill Burke &lt;bburke@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    Here&#39;s my thoughts on the compatibility of Transactions and REST.\n&gt;&gt; Maybe\n&gt;&gt; now you can see where I am coming from.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; http://bill.burkecentral.com/2009/09/21/credit-cards-transactions-and-rest/\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   \n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \nBediako George\nPartner - Lucid Technics, LLC\nThink Clearly, Think Lucid\nwww.lucidtechnics.com\n(p) 202.683.7486 (f) 703.563.6279\n\r\n--00163630f3c3a4ee400474e721f1\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nHullo Benjamin,&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I must admit I am having some trouble un=\r\nderstanding the distinction you make between server state and application s=\r\ntate. =C2=A0In principal I get the theoretical difference, but I think the =\r\nexamples you give don&#39;t necessarily illustrate the point, and in one ca=\r\nse confuses me.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Taking Bill&#39;s credit card tra=\r\nnsaction example, if the client authorizes the server to charge the credit =\r\ncard and a record of that charge is created, this means that the number of =\r\nresources on the server side will increase every time a client authorizes a=\r\n charge to its credit card. =C2=A0What kind of state is this, application o=\r\nr service?&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Also looking at your pessimistic locki=\r\nng example, it seems to me that the requirement to &quot;clean up&quot; loc=\r\nks on the server is not a necessary requirement. =C2=A0It should suffice to=\r\n have the locks expire, and to have the server ignore the presence of all e=\r\nxpired locks. =C2=A0It seems to me that this could be done in a manner that=\r\n would not require the server to remember the state.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;Do you see why I am confused? =C2=A0In reading your post, it seems that=\r\n the pessimistic lock example could be implemented in a style that would no=\r\nt break the guidelines you suggested. =C2=A0It also seems that in the case =\r\nof a credit card transaction authorization, according to your example, that=\r\n storing it as a resource would be simply be an attempt to transfer what co=\r\nuld be considered trying to convert application state into service state.&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I am struggling with this concept, and would value=\r\n any input you (or anyone else) may have that would help to clarify this.&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Of course if the answer is simply &quot;restful sta=\r\ntelessness means no server side database dummy&quot; then I completely unde=\r\nrstand. =C2=A0I hope that isn&#39;t the answer however. :)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;div cla=\r\nss=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Wed, Sep 30, 2009 at 6:06 PM, Benjamin Carlyle &lt;span =\r\ndir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:benjamincarlyle@...&quot;&gt;benjam=\r\nincarlyle@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;g=\r\nmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-l=\r\neft:1ex;&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;background-color:#ffffff&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;=C2=A0=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;width:655px&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;width:470px;margin:0;pad=\r\nding:0 25px 0 0;float:left&quot;&gt;\n\n    &lt;div&gt;\n                  &lt;p&gt;Bill,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;H=\r\nere are mine: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://soundadvice.id.au/blog/2009/06/13#stateless=\r\n&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://soundadvice.id.au/blog/2009/06/13#stateless&lt;/a&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;:)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Benjamin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;\n2009/9/22=\r\n Bill Burke &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:bburke@...&quot; targ=\r\net=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bburke@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;block=\r\nquote class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;border-left:1px solid rgb(204, 204, 20=\r\n4)&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255)&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n\n    &lt;div&gt;\n                  &lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s my thoughts o=\r\nn the compatibility of Transactions and REST.
