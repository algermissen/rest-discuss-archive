The browser\nis just the software that presents and operates upon the\napplication state.\n\nForms usually change the state of the browser as well.\n\nLinks and forms are specific UI mechanisms in HTML that teach\nthe browser how to construct the request upon activation.\nA more elaborate media type could have more elaborate\nmechanisms, and non-browser clients are even less restricted\nin how they interact with media.\n\nAlthough GET requests are not requesting a state change, it is\nstill possible for some resource states to change in response\nto a GET.  For example, there may be some other resource that\ncounts the number of GETs, or the most recent user agent.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
