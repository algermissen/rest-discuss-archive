But they\n&gt; should not standardize it in software. If they want to be able to go\n&gt; (let&#39;s say) from a book&#39;s page to it&#39;s author&#39;s page, software should\n&gt; not blindly add /author. Rather it should look for an\n&gt; &lt;author&gt;...&lt;/author&gt; XML tag. That allows the person maintaining the\n&gt; site to move author elements to a totally different site if they decide\n&gt; that is better. They update all of their &lt;author&gt;...&lt;/author&gt; tags and\n&gt; they are done.\n\nWhere &lt;author&gt; is a named property and its value is a reference (whose value\nspace is the URI space)?\n\nProviding these &#39;named backpointers&#39; is good - lets address de-referencing\nto be changed locally.\nThere is still coordination between parties, but only on names and semantics\nof properties (and their location) and not syntax (references remain\nopaque).\n\nIt can be problematic to provide these backpointers when also carrying other\ncontent in a response - not that a header won&#39;t work, but that some clients\ncan&#39;t get to it. What do you guys think?\n\n"}}
