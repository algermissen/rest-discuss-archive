How do you create a container?\n&gt;\n&gt; Theoretically, you simply PUT something that needs containment,\n&gt; as evidenced by the slash in the path.  However, most webdav\n&gt; implementers believed that a collection should exist prior to\n&gt; a PUT within it, since that makes it easier to catch user mistakes\n&gt; such as mistyping a long URI.  Hence, MKCOL.\n\nWhy is slash definitive about containment?\nIf you PUT /foo/bar?baz, does that create a\ncontainer?\nHow about PUT http://objectname.domain.com?\n\nMy claim at this point is that (ignorning WebDAV)\nURLs tell you nothing about containment relations.\n\n&gt; &gt; 4. How do you DELETE a non-empty container and its contents?\n&gt; &gt;   My answer: DELETE /container\n&gt;\n&gt; That is certainly how the user agent would express the semantic.\n&gt; The server might tell you to delete the children first.\n\nThis is actually related to the question I didn&#39;t\nask.  What happens when you GET a container?  I\nthink that GET on a container isn&#39;t standardized\nbecause, again, HTTP URLs are not defined to have\ncontainment relations.  I think for WebDAV to\nspecify DELETE in this context without\nconstraining GET is weird.\n\nNote: If GET were specified on a containe, we\nwouldn&#39;t need index.html files.\n\n&gt; BTW, why do you switch from &quot;collection&quot; to &quot;container&quot;?\n\nWe are talking implicitly about containment\nrelationships.  A directory contains other files,\nit does not collect them.\n\nNote: If you want to use collection, then I would\nobserve that to delete a name for the collection\nis not to delete the members of the collection.\n\nAnd to DELETE a URL is really only to DELETE a\nname.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
