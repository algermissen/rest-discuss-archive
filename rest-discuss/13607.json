Clearly not all URIs are cool, but TimBL  \n&gt; believes all URIs should be cool. I quoted from TimBLs Cool URIs  \n&gt; design noteabove and I&#39;ll quote it again here:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It is the the duty of a [URI space designer] to allocate URIs  \n&gt;&gt; which you will be able to stand by in 2 years, in 20 years, in 200  \n&gt;&gt; years. This needs thought, and organization, and commitment.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; Nowhere in this note does he ever suggest that only SOME URIs need  \n&gt; be cool.  His design note clearly suggests (at least to me) that  \n&gt; web designers and implementers should strive to make ALL URIs as  \n&gt; cool as possible. Here&#39;s the closing sentence of the note:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The message here is, however, that many, many things can change  \n&gt;&gt; and your URIs can and should stay the same. They only can if you  \n&gt;&gt; think about how you design them.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; Where do you get the idea that not all URIs need be or should be  \n&gt; cool? (If I am understanding you correctly...)\n\nUmm, maybe the several hundred conversations I&#39;ve had on\nthe topic with TimBL in the room.  Cool URIs are permanent,\nso if you want to be cool then make permanence a design\ncriteria.  That&#39;s all there is to it.  Nobody is going to\nargue against too much URI permanence.  There is certainly\nnothing about that in conflict with REST, so if you perceive\na conflict then I suggest you look at your reasoning and\nkill the paper tiger.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
