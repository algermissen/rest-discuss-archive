In which case you&#39;re only changing one property of\nthe order &quot;object&quot; on your server -- its mapping.  REST isn&#39;t CRUD.  In\na hypertext API, it&#39;s often best to have different URI paths for the\nsame set of server objects, if their policies vary based on a property\nlike status...\n\nWeb servers configure policies based on path, so add another URI mapping\ninstead of making server logic more complex by trying to apply different\npolicies based on parsing content for &#39;canceled=true&#39;.  Try to think in\nterms of hypertext applications instead of serializing objects to\nhypertext -- status isn&#39;t a field in a hypertext document in REST when\nits semantics overlap that of HTTP status responses, especially if\nstatus varies by user role:\n\nThe customer checking /orders/1 knows they&#39;ve successfully canceled it,\nbecause their DELETE request responded 200 OK with the order and new\nstatus in the message body, and that URL now responds to GET with 410\nGone.  The 410 response may include the order as its entity, or not,\nfor the customer role.\n\nOther user roles, i.e. admin, may get redirected to /canceled/1, where\nthey are subject to different policies than exist for an active order.\nAdmins may DELETE from /canceled to actually delete a canceled order,\nwhile customers are 403 Forbidden from entering /canceled to begin with.\nAlso, just because you&#39;re using the DELETE method, doesn&#39;t mean the UI\nhas to say &quot;delete&quot; on the cancel control.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The implementation of PATCH with a body &#39;status=Canceled&#39; can be\n&gt; tricky if you also accept changes to other fields, which may or may\n&gt; not have some logic associated to them.\n&gt;\n\nWhat matters is user intent.  Clear intention to cancel an order should\nunambiguously be its own operation from the UI-design perspective; from\nthe protocol perspective, this idempotent user action should be made\nexplicitly visible on the wire by selecting the most appropriate HTTP\nmethod.\n\nOf all manipulations we may allow for an order, this is the only one\nthat&#39;s self-explanatory without transferring a representation, another\nindication that DELETE has the semantics we&#39;re after, provided we don&#39;t\nget hung up on having to delete something -- which we don&#39;t!\n\nIf, to the requesting user, canceling an order makes it go away, then\nusing DELETE meets the self-descriptive messaging and uniform interface\nconstraints of REST.  What happens to the order is an implementation\ndetail, hidden behind the uniform interface.  To the world-at-large,\nthe traffic pattern of an order cancellation looks like exactly what it\nis, as the principle of generality has been followed.\n\nThe visibility of DELETE allows intermediaries to mark cached copies\nof /orders/1 as stale. This optimization is built-in to the deployed\ninfrastructure of the Web, all it does here is ensure the requesting\nuser doesn&#39;t re-load a stale copy of /orders/1 which fails to reflect\nthe results of the action just taken.  This can&#39;t be done with PATCH,\neven if you can get close by marking the request as idempotent.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
