At least starting with Frege,\n\n  (Vx)(x = x)\n\nhas been taken as a logical truth. IOW, *everything* has identity. Or to \nquote Quine, &quot;No entity without identity&quot;.\n\nSeeing as RFC 2396 is coming up for revision I think now would be a good \ntime to get rid of this silliness once and for all.\n\nCheers,\n\n\nMiles\n\n"}}
