It&#39;s not\n&gt; much of an improvement over doc style SOAP. Just being RESTful isn&#39;t\n&gt; enough to encourage widespread adoption. Yay: there&#39;s no verb in the\n&gt; message. Yay, they obey HTTP method semantics. Apart from that they\n&gt; both wrap a document in an envelope.\n\nI&#39;m not sure I agree with your carte blanche reasoning that an envelope is a \nbad idea.  Having a simple enveloping structure can help divorce transmission \nsemantics from document semantics in a nice way.  SOAP is just too \ncomplicated, too rigid and too tied to other crap like XSDs, WSDLs and the \nlike, and fosters RPC thinking more than not.  \n\nThe Atom format looks like a much nicer, lightweight framework for \ninformation publishing and consuming.  And the APP provides behavioural rules \non how to transport that format over HTTP, basically providing an off-the-\nshelf, standardized REST mechanism, which is not a bad thing.\n\n&gt; As long as servers and clients have to agree ahead of time on complete\n&gt; document semantics they&#39;re forcing one another to lock in code at\n&gt; development time. \n\nI don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to see a resolution of that semantic agreement in \nmy lifetime.  At least not that is understandable and implementable by mere \nmortals (most semantic web initiatives are not either).  And I see nothing \nwrong with solving businsess problems by designing and formalizing document \nsemantics between involved parties in the meantime.  Better than not solving \nthe problems.  A good example is the  Integrated Health Record holy grail \nthat most western countries are desperate to move towards.  You&#39;re not going \nto resolve the semantic issues in that arena using automated approaches any \ntime soon.  T\n\n&gt; But the aspect of the web that promotes independent\n&gt; evolution is the dialog that goes on between server and agent -- in\n&gt; particular forms. Servers tell agents how to compose messages; they\n&gt; don&#39;t agree on message formats ahead of time.\n\nYou know, my inquiry was to do with integration schenarios, machine to \nmachine, between existing systems for the most part.  Don&#39;t much care about \nthe web as you define it above, in the context of what I&#39;m working on of \ncourse, except as a global transmission and connectivity mesh.\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t think APP is a failure. I&#39;m just saying you won&#39;t see\n&gt; significantly more &quot;programmable web&quot; using APP than you would have\n&gt; with SOAP.\n\nLike I said, I&#39;m interested in more classic integration scenarios and not the \nconcept of a &quot;programmable web&quot;, and that is the context within which I want \nto discuss Atom and APP applicability.\n\n&gt; Don&#39;t you start me talking!\n\nWhy not?  That was the intent of my post.  To initiate a discussion of the \nmerits and possibilities of using Atom and APP for things other than blogs. \n;-)\n\n\n\nAndrzej Jan Taramina\nChaeron Corporation: Enterprise System Solutions\nhttp://www.chaeron.com\n\n\n"}}
