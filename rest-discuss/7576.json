Like it or not, both the hypertext and the\n&gt; : URI are part of the user interface of a web application.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, but the constraints on &quot;good hypertext&quot; are not the same\n&gt; as the constraints on &quot;good URI&quot;.  So when the information  \n&gt; architecture\n&gt; changes, where are you?\n\nYou&#39;re right, there it is much more cumbersome to change the URI than  \nthe representation, because people and software may have linked to,  \nbookmarked, indexed, etc., that page at that URI. That&#39;s one reason  \nit is so important to think hard about what your URIs should be in  \nthe first place. But you *can* change them and then redirect the old  \nURIs to the new one.\n\nFor example, to log into Artima, originally I used a JSP that came  \nwith Jive software, and the URL was:\n\nhttp://www.artima.com/login.jsp\n\nI stopped using JSP at one point and switched to simply indicating  \nwhat came back was HTML with a .html extension:\n\nhttp://www.artima.com/login.html\n\nThen I decided the name of the page should match the link to it,  \nwhich was &quot;sign in&quot; not &quot;log in,&quot; so I changed it to:\n\nhttp://www.artima.com/signin.html\n\nThen I read something, maybe &quot;Cool URIs Don&#39;t Change,&quot; that convinced  \nme that I shouldn&#39;t put the .html on the end. I also read something  \nabout search engines that indicated that words separated by  \nunderscores would be indexed. So I changed it to:\n\nhttp://www.artima.com/sign_in\n\nAll the old forms redirect to the latest one. No broken links. No  \nlost Google juice. Changing URIs can be done, it&#39;s just not as easy  \nor advisable as changing representations.\n\n&gt; :\n&gt; : &gt; Benefits:\n&gt; : &gt;\n&gt; : &gt; 1. You train your user to use the system at full leverage.\n&gt; : &gt;\n&gt; : What do you mean by &quot;full leverage?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Let the server tell you where it is meaningful to go. Click instead\n&gt; of type.\n&gt;\nIt isn&#39;t just users typing into the address bar, but users simply  \nlooking at the URI to get an idea of where they are in the info  \narchitecture. Yes, you can be successful with ugly URIs. Amazon has  \ncertainly trained their users to not try and figure out where they  \nare based on the URI. But I still think short, crisp, meaningful URIs  \nmake a web app more user-friendly.\n\n&gt; : Yes, that&#39;s what I mean by canonical. A canonical form, to which\n&gt; : other URIs that may mean the same thing redirect to.\n&gt;\n&gt; Oh, well in my analysis, &quot;canonical URI&quot; and &quot;canonical URI form&quot;\n&gt; are two radically different ideas.\n&gt;\nI&#39;m curious how you define these two differently?\n\nThanks.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nPresident\nArtima, Inc.\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n\n\n"}}
