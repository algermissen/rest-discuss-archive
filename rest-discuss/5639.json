That means it would have to &quot;be&quot; something that represents a\n&gt; &gt; fairly universal concept, like &quot;image/*&quot; or &quot;text/*&quot;. The question to\n&gt; &gt; ask is &quot;could I fit it into the current MIME system without prefixing it\n&gt; &gt; with application/&quot;?\n&gt; I get what you mean. But just a minor question, why not\n&gt; &quot;application/&quot;, since ATOM is registered under &quot;application/atom+xml&quot;?\n\nI think the introduction of xml has confused this scheme somewhat, as\nthis specification seems geared towards telling us that &quot;atom is encoded\nas xml&quot; rather than &quot;atom is full of human readable blog entries&quot;. Atom\nis confused again by its ambition to be a transport protocol in its own\nright, possibly including podcasts of mp3s rather than xhtml content. My\nthinking is that atom&#39;s importance will be eclipsed by hAtom, the\nmicroformat that follows its data model. That will clearly be &quot;text&quot;, as\nit is embedded in xhtml. Plain atom can then focus on being for podcasts\nand all sorts of other media ;)\n\nIt isn&#39;t a hard and fast rule, but the reason I don&#39;t include\napplication mime types in my view of REST is that &quot;application&quot; doesn&#39;t\nmean anything semantically. It just says &quot;some data&quot;. application/xml\nfalls outside my definition of REST because it carries application- and\nindustry-specific semantics. Its semantics aren&#39;t necessarily grounded\nin universal concepts. On the other hand, text/html is grounded in the\nuniversal text concept. Other forms of html (no matter how they are\ncategorised in any current perverted MIME) also contain universal\nsemantics. They are part of REST for me.\n\n-- \nBenjamin Carlyle &lt;benjamincarlyle@...&gt;\n\n\n"}}
