Section 4.3 states that &quot;unless explicitly allowed\n&gt; &gt;&gt; for a request method, a message-body MUST NOT be sent&quot;; section\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 9.3 indeed does not explictly allow a message-body in requests\n&gt; &gt;&gt; with the GET method.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s very misleading, as that text does not appear in 4.3. What it\n&gt; &gt; *does* say is this;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;A message-body MUST NOT be included in a request if the  \n&gt; specification\n&gt; &gt; of the request method (section 5.1.1) does not allow sending an\n&gt; &gt; entity-body in requests&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\t\n&gt; &gt; Since GET doesn&#39;t rule it out, it is supported.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would agree if the text said &quot;A message-body MUST NOT be included  \n&gt; in a\n&gt; request if the specification of the request method (section 5.1.1)\n&gt; disallows sending an entity-body in requests.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; However, as it stands, the specification doesn&#39;t provide any allowance\n&gt; for a entity body, so we MUST NOT include one.\n&gt;\nI think we neeed Propositional Calculus 101 :-).\n\nThe RFC in that section only specificies when message-bodies MUST NOT  \nbe included in requests. GET does not satisfy those conditions,  \ntherefore as per sections 5.1.1 and 5.9 message-bodies are *allowded*  \nin GET requests. Strictly speaking the rule says nothing about what  \nhappens when nothing is said, but an RFC is not an axiomatic system so  \nin practice you interpret that follows, or else you can say that is  \nsimply unespecified.\n\nAs I blogged in the URL above, I see a stopper in section 9.3 in an  \nindirect way:\n\n    The GET method means retrieve whatever information (in the form of  \nan entity)\n    is identified by the Request-URI.\n\nThat implies the resource has to be completely identified by the URI.  \nMy motivation here was to try to figure out whether we could send GET  \nwhen GET is the correct verb, and overcome the practical limitations  \nin URL lengths. That sentence seems to rule that out.\n\n-- fxn\n\n\n"}}
