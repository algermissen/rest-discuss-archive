POST is not a\n&quot;do it&quot; verb.  Do It is a command, although generalized to\nthe max.\n\nPOST says &quot;here is some information; you know best what\nto do (or not to do) with it&quot;.\n\nThat may seem degenerate, from a command orientation,\ni.e., where the client has a clue about what operation should\nbe performed.  Sometimes though, the client may be\nhandling a piece of opaque data that only the server knows\nwhat to do with.\n\nIn some context, a client may be POSTing a piece of data\nwhich it understands perfectly well, but simply does not\nknow what should be done with it on the server side.  For\nexample, in a blackboard architecture, an agent pulls down\na piece of an overall problem, solves it, and posts back\nthe solution.  The client does not know how to integrate its\nsolution with the overall one, so POST is as specific an\ninstruction as it can give.  Perhaps its solution does not fit\nwith the overall emergent strategy, and will simply be\ndiscarded.  Either way.\n\nPS - don&#39;t say &#39;semantic&#39;.  Please.\n\nWalden\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Jan Algermissen&quot; &lt;algermissen1971@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;Bill de hOra&quot; &lt;bill@...&gt;\nCc: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, December 02, 2006 1:40 PM\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] Atom, &#39;process-this&#39;-POST and rockets\n\n\n: \n: On Dec 2, 2006, at 5:25 PM, Bill de hOra wrote:\n: \n: &gt; j\n: &gt;\n: &gt; It often seems to me that POST is a catchall for &quot;do it&quot;.\n: I guess so, yes.

It moves all the semantics into the client  \n: making a choice for exactly that resource that behaves as desired  \n: upon POST. Thus, binding is on resource &#39;type&#39; (e.g. &#39;order  \n: processor&#39;) as opposed to method semantics.
