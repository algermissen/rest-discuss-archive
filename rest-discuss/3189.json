Mike Dierken (mdierken@......:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;Gary Shea&quot; &lt;shea@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; This looks good overall.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To find an order by order number, the client does a GET on\n&gt; &gt; /order-numbers, which returns a page of metadata, like for instance:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     &lt;orders&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;ranges&gt;\n&gt; &gt;     &lt;range begin=&quot;375&quot; end=&quot;399&quot; uri=&quot;/db/1201&quot; /&gt;\n&gt; &gt;     &lt;range begin=&quot;400&quot; end=&quot;424&quot; uri=&quot;/db/14287&quot; /&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;/ranges&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;singleton number=&quot;425&quot; uri=&quot;/db/1798&quot; /&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;singleton number=&quot;426&quot; uri=&quot;/db/1855&quot; /&gt;\n&gt; &gt;     &lt;/orders&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not clear on what the begin/end range means - could you explain?\n&gt; Is an individual order addressable?\n\nSorry, I could have been more clear.\n\nAn individual order is addressable.  The idea was to find an individual\norder by traversing an n-ary tree of uris.  Inner nodes of the tree map\na range of order numbers to a child node of the tree.  The desired\norder&#39;s uri would be found in a leaf of the tree.\n\nI took this (baroque?) approach because the uri /order/by-number/2275 is\nso not opaque!  It felt more ReSTful to act like a browser and follow\na chain of links to get where I needed to go.  The performance cost is\nnot likely to be significant, given the predicted order load.  Plus,\nif the process that traverses the tree has any kind of lifetime, it can\ncache everything, as none of the links change.\n\nToo weird?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I see the singletons as necessary because a partial range uri must be\n&gt; &gt; kept forever in case someone cached it, yuck.  This way, when a range is\n&gt; &gt; complete, it is allocated a permanent uri; until then it is returned as\n&gt; &gt; a collection of singletons.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To mark an order seen, the client does a DELETE on the uri acquired from\n&gt; &gt; /new-orders.\n&gt; I while ago there was some discussion about acknowledging messages or\n&gt; marking a resource as being processed in some way - there was a comparison\n&gt; between DELETE and POST with a body of &#39;status=seen&#39;. I think the end result\n&gt; was that if there are multiple status values (ready, locked, finished, etc.)\n&gt; then you would POST the status (or PUT to a more detailed URI). If the\n&gt; existence of the resource is all the indication needed, then DELETE probably\n&gt; will work fine. Since you have two distinct URIs for &#39;new-orders&#39; and\n&gt; &#39;acknowledged orders&#39; - deleting the one resource merely removes the\n&gt; relationship that the order is &#39;new&#39; (or however you want to think of it)\n&gt; rather than deleting the order itself.\n\nThat makes sense.  One of the next steps will be associating a status\nwith each order so this is very relevant!  Using POST as you describe\nsounds like the way to go for updating the order status.  If I think of\nNOT_SEEN as the initial status, I could use the POST as you describe to\nset the status to SEEN.  So if the order is located at /order/2345,\nI could post to /order/2345/status, for instance.\n\nRegards,\n\n\tGary Shea\n\tshea@...\n\n\n"}}
