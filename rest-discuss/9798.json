It would be nice if it\n&gt; knew everything about HTTP redirects.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would also like to be able to browse the cache easily for debugging\n&gt; purposes. I would like to be able to pull up a window of of cache\n&gt; history, find the last request made, and be able to trace all the\n&gt; request that were made as part of a request.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is important to be able to browse the message exchanges easily so\n&gt; as to make it easy to debug all of this.\n&gt;\n&gt; Henry\n&gt;\n&gt; Home page: http://bblfish.net/\n&gt; Sun Blog: http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/\n&gt; Foaf name: http://bblfish.net/people/henry/card#me\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
