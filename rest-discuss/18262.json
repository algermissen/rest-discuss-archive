Th=\r\nere is a (somewhat vague) obligation for services not to change their natur=\r\ne and also, IMHO, to keep the abstract kind of resources stable. E.g. if I =\r\nbookmark a product link at Amazon and send that link to my friend, I assume=\r\n it will remain that product (the conceptual mapping should be stable over =\r\ntime). (&quot;Cool URIs don&#39;t change&quot;). Otherwise, the whole idea of bookmarking=\r\n would be moot.\n\nBut the representation can vary (and thus evolve) and conn=\r\neg (late binding of capabilities) will solve this at runtime.\n\nBTW, this is=\r\n a very interesting aspect of REST: it is constraining over time - no other=\r\n arch. style does that. And you can say that REST does not achieve evolvabi=\r\nlity by being lax - indeed REST achives evolvability by being particularly =\r\nconstraining. - but in the right spots.\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; /J=F8rn\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In res=\r\nt-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Jan Algermissen &lt;jan.algermissen@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Dec 30, 2011, at 3:35 AM, Glenn Block wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jan\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If the link relation is documented / registered, where is the ha=\r\nrm if it says in the documentation these are supported media types (not nec=\r\nessarily being the exclusive set) and this is how the data will look for th=\r\nose types?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Coupling.
