I\ntake it from your comments that you are at least pleased that we, the TAG,\ncan write architecture in the positive sense.  One of the mechanisms we have\nbeen using is the difference between the architecture document and the\nfindings.  We are trying to put &quot;the positive&quot; into the architecture doc,\nand have the extended discussion in the findings.  I think this goes partway\nto what you are looking for, but not as far as you&#39;d like.  I wonder how we\ncould get an ongoing, useful and open discussion going.  Thinking aloud\n(electronically so to speak), maybe we could have TAG findings refer to well\nwritten patterns or anti-patterns..  At any rate, the TAG is certainly open\nto ideas on how to better communicate with the various constituents, and how\nto receive feedback/input.  Much of a successful architect&#39;s job is\ncommunicating.\n\nFWIW, I believe that we have a real disconnect and inability to talk about\nvarious architectural styles in a detailed and positive manner.  I know I&#39;ll\nget into trouble saying this on the REST discussion list, but none of us are\nreally shrinking violets...\n\nAny architecture, REST or otherwise, makes certain trade-offs that hinder\nsome users or agents, and help others.  There may be a REST anti-pattern -\nsuch as methods in the SOAP body anybody? - that are patterns in another\narchitecture.  Now there are trade-offs to either.  One of Roy&#39;s points\nabout why methods are bad in the body is because it adds another element to\nthe security context, particularly encumbering the firewall admin.  On the\nws-arch list, I wrote up 3 various ways that a simple GET/SET stockquote\ncould be done using 1) method names in body, 2) GET/POST; 3) different URLs.\nAnd then I drilled into the way the firewall admin would administer each of\nthe designs.  This unfortunately didn&#39;t spark much discussion.  When I&#39;ve\nspent time with others - such as Mark Baker - and tried to drill into this\nissue, it&#39;s not clear to me how significant the down side is.  So I admit\nthat even though I can quote scripture - even wrote up some REST/shared\ninformation space scripture for the TAG bible - I haven&#39;t gotten the &quot;faith&quot;\nthat there is only one acceptable architecture for what we want to do with\nmuch of machine to machine communications.\n\nWhat I would ask from the REST community is that it be open to rationale,\ndetailed and reasoned discussion about the trade-offs associated with\ndiverse architectural styles.  Too much of the debate so far has been simply\nn party broadcast monologues, to paraphrase MLK.\n\nCheers,\nDave\n\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: www-ws-arch-request@...

Roy said that many CGI scripts suck because they don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; implement REST properly.  Don&#39;t think I&#39;m misquoting him.\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m pointing out that we don&#39;t look at the sucky CGI scripts\n&gt; &gt; when determine web architecture because, well, they suck.\n&gt;\n&gt; David,\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, on the other hand worst practices and antipatterns are highly\n&gt; valuable guides to developers in the trenches, especially given the\n&gt; amount of trench and the way people tend to cut and paste web systems\n&gt; together (CGI being a prime example). For example, saying\n&gt; it&#39;s better to\n&gt; not invent a new URI scheme is not quite the same as saying\n&gt; an arbitrary\n&gt; new scheme sucks (cue: reason). As one example, the OO world\n&gt; has learned\n&gt; much via antipatterns. Today, I suggest that saying non RESTful CGIs\n&gt; suck is less useful that concrete examples; REST is not exactly\n&gt; mainstream thinking yet.\n&gt;\n&gt; There&#39;s a good amount of physical architecture in the world that is\n&gt; based on what not to do as much as what to do. One thing the TAG could\n&gt; say to the web community is, look we can&#39;t do it all, you guys start\n&gt; writing the anti-patterns down and let us concentrate on the\n&gt; architecture in a positive form.\n&gt;\n&gt; regards,\n&gt; Bill de h�ra\n&gt;\n&gt; ..\n&gt; Propylon\n&gt; www.propylon.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
