In\nterms of abstract REST, Iâ€™d say definitely.\n\n&gt; On the other hand, I think the very fact that we have long\n&gt; discussions about these topics indicates that any real world\n&gt; system is going to break the REST model somewhere, and we&#39;re\n&gt; just looking for the least ugly compromise.  \n\nRemember that REST is not the same as HTTP, and realworld HTTP is\neven further removed from purity. Mapping REST to HTTP is what\ncauses the sort of metaphor shear that this group often has to\ndiscuss, I think.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
