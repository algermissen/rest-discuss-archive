If the action you were completing is\n&quot;idempotent&quot; then by definition it is safe to try again and again until it\nsucceeds. The HTTP GET, PUT and DELETE methods are idempotent. If you think\nabout them as if they were file system commands it should be clear why. It\nnever hurts to read a file over and over again. It also does not hurt to\nwrite a file over and over again as long as you are writing the same data.\nAnd deleting a file repeatedly will at most give you an error message.\n\nOn the other hand, the POST command is sort of like adding to a file. You\ncan see how adding the same data to a file over and over again is very\ndifferent than merely overwriting the file with the same data over and over\nagain. POSTed data often accumulates. Because POSTed data accumulates we\nneed to make certain that we set up our system so that multiple POSTs of the\nsame data are not harmful.&quot;\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Paul Prescod&quot; &lt;paul@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;; &lt;fnparr@...&gt;;\n&lt;mconner@...&gt;; &lt;stephen_todd@...&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, January 23, 2002 10:40 PM\nSubject: [rest-discuss] Reliable HTTP\n\n\n&gt; Maybe of interest to you:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.prescod.net/reliable_http.html\n&gt;\n&gt; Comments are welcome.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Paul Prescod\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
