Add foreign markup extensions under atom:entry.\n&gt; \n&gt; That is a dangerous path. One of the problems with RSS that led\n&gt; to the Atom effort is that it has no facilities for transporting\n&gt; any data other than textual content, so everything gets shoved\n&gt; into extension elements, so every application needs to extend RSS\n&gt; in its own private new way.\n&gt; \n&gt; Atom was meant to break away from that mess, not reintroduce it.\n&gt; Thatâ€™s what the addition of @type to atom:content and the careful\n&gt; deliberation about the content model in general was all about.\n\nI was there too.\n\nI don&#39;t agree it&#39;s a dangerous path given Atom&#39;s processing model. It \nbecomes a problem when you break that model (eg, these new elements are \nrequired today)\n\n\n&gt; I would suggest strongly that Atom should only be augmented with\n&gt; extension elements for protocol purposes, as in AtomPub. \n\nWhy?\n\n\n&gt; The data\n&gt; contained in an entry should remain largely intact when detached\n&gt; from the envelope. This pretty much necessitates the use of\n&gt; atom:content.\n\nI can&#39;t see the best practice value of putting extensions in content. \nCan you explain?\n\n\n&gt; Instead of diminishing the role of atom:content and finding a\n&gt; way to auxiliary facilities of Atom fit the data, the right way\n&gt; of dealing with the problem would be to find a way to make one\n&gt; of the range of available hypermedia media types fit the data. I\n&gt; think people dismiss XHTML far too easily because they consider\n&gt; it somehow presentational, f.ex., or not structured enough,\n&gt; whatever that may mean. RDF has an inexplicably bad reputation,\n&gt; as well. \n\nI don&#39;t agree with inexplicable if you&#39;re talking about RDF syntaxes.\n\nBill\n\n"}}
