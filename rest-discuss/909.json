I come from the Business \nProcess group. You&#39;re looking into DAML-S business process models. I \nthink in some ways we are a generation ahead.  We do technology-\nneutral models, but are developing an RDF representation.  DAML-S is \nahead of us on RDF, we&#39;re ahead in resource modeling and use of \nresource state for pre and post condition expressions.  I think in \nthe near future we will try to get together with them (the models are \nsimilar enough to converge), but it&#39;s another case of too few hours \nin a day.  \n\n[...]\n\nPaul Prescod:\n&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t really have the time to become an ebxml reg/rep expert but \nI do\n&gt;&gt; feel that the ebXML world is a natural ally for the REST world \nbecause\n&gt;&gt; they seem to be document-centric rather than API and software-\ncentric.\n\nMark Baker:\n&gt;Well, there&#39;s definitely conflicting goals there. \n&gt;It would not have been hard for them to decentralize \n&gt;without using REST, but they chose not to. \n&gt;So I think that there&#39;s forces at work there.\n\nThere are definitely forces at work in the regrep group, and they \ncome from your previous employer.  Much of ebXML is P2P.  The \nbusiness process stuff is all P2P at this point.  I think they would \nbe open to REST.  Or at least I am, and so are some others in my gang.\n\n&gt; And I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s no value to evangelizing \n&gt; it to them. It&#39;s just that there&#39;s only so many hours \n&gt; in a day.\n\nI&#39;m not sure why you keep repeating this to me. I&#39;m not regrep.  You \ndon&#39;t need to evangelize me, I came to you.  All I want is to find \nsomebody to discuss this stuff with me respectfully.  In particular, \nanswer questions.\n\nOr actually I don&#39;t even need that, I can go back to lurking, and \nI&#39;ll get it just fine.\n\nOne problem I am having now is that there are at least five different \napproaches for how to do the resource modeling on the table: mine \n(not a proposal yet), Paul Prescod&#39;s, Mike Dierken&#39;s, Jeff Bone&#39;s and \nMark Baker&#39;s.  And there are some terminology issues confusing them.\n\nOne terminology issue is &quot;accept&quot;:  the standard business protocol \nfor contracts (orders are a kind of contract) is offer-acceptance. \nAccepted is also used as an HTTP response.  But the semantics of the \ntwo uses are very different.  \n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
