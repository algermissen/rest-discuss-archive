There are certainly many\n&gt; examples in that domain where high-volume writing\n&gt; (create/update/delete) is a requirement and efficiency is key (as is\n&gt; atomicity).\n&gt; \n\nREST is but one architectural style.  For the cases you describe, it\ncould very well be the best slaughterhouse ever designed, but wholly\ninappropriate for the goals of the project.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Are you suggesting that as an architecture style in its &quot;pure&quot; form,\n&gt; REST is only appropriate for the common case of read-heavy Web\n&gt; applications?\n&gt;\n\nAbsolutely not.  I said it&#39;s only *designed* for the common case of the\nWeb, taken directly from Dr. Fielding&#39;s dissertation.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Is the style so set in stone that new applications for it shouldn&#39;t be\n&gt; explored, even if it means looking at things from a slightly\n&gt; unorthodox angle?\n&gt;\n\nApparently you&#39;re not familiar with my history on this list... ;-)  I&#39;ve\nsuggested plenty of radical departures from REST orthodoxy, I was\nparticularly disappointed that the consensus shot down my confirmed-\ndelete-at-protocol-level idea, but the reasoning was sound.\n\nShould we not also recognize here when an idea is fundamentally at odds\nwith the REST style and end the debate?  I don&#39;t see any permathreads\ninsisting that RPC-based architectures can somehow be made RESTful.  It\nwould be beating a dead horse.\n\nThe REST paradigm consists of clients making discrete requests at the\nURI of the resource in question.  The RPC paradigm consists of sending\ninstructions to the server at a &quot;factory&quot; resource.  Batch processing\nclearly falls under the latter paradigm, not the former.\n\nThe REST solution to batch deletion is for the client to make discrete\nDELETE requests to each URI.  Period.  That&#39;s what REST *is*.  It&#39;s an\n_alternative_ to the notion of batch deletion.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
