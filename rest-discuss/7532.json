If you have static tree of resources the \n&gt; end user drills down, then &quot;A&quot; is the most natural.

HTML FORMs support C better\nthan A, but I was explicitly asking about REST based systems which we all\nknow HTML FORMs do not well support.\n\nThanks for the comments.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
