I&#39;d be tempted to\n&gt; &gt; use /patients/schema or /patients/structure on which a GET will\n&gt; &gt; return the required fields list (alternatively the list returned from\n&gt; &gt; a GET to /patients could include a link to the patients\n&gt; &gt; required field structure, see also my ps below).\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure why both of your designs includes a link instead of just\n&gt; inlining the &quot;schema&quot; or &quot;form&quot;. Think of it like an HTML page with a\n&gt; form at the bottom that says: &quot;add a patient by clicking here.&quot;\n\nThat&#39;s a definite true but that means you&#39;d have to fetch the list of\npatients just to get the information to create a new one. By extracting that\ninformation out into a separate resource you can fetch the required fields\nwithout listing any patients. If we&#39;re transforming the output for display\nin a browser, we can always use the document() function to fetch the\nrequired fields to display at the bottom of the patient list.\n\n&gt; But the analogy breaks down because if there is no human being on the\n&gt; other end then who interprets the schema and figures out where to get\n&gt; the information to shove into each field? At best I can see the schema\n&gt; being useful as a filter over named fields that are known at design\n&gt; time. &quot;I don&#39;t need that field right now so don&#39;t bother sending it.&quot;\n&gt; But then that&#39;s just a performance optimization to avoid sending extra\n&gt; information.\n\nI&#39;m not sure I understand. In our system there is either a human entering\nthe data into the fields for each resource or there is another automated\ninterface that knows how to map fields from systems in other parts of the\nhospital into our fields. Either way, they need to know the basic structure\nof the objects including the field names, types, constraints, etc.\n\nI admit that having configurable resources makes my example a little more\ncomplex than others would be. But I really appreciate the comments you guys\nare giving me. I think I&#39;m finally starting to understand the concept of\nresource modelling and hope to get to update my design soon.\n\nThanks,\nJason\n\n\n\n"}}
