Serendipitous re-use is the goal; if you&#39;ve created a custom\nmedia type, how does Google know how to index it?  How will Web or DNS\naccelerators interact with it?  That is, unless it resembles HTML\nclosely enough for sniffing to decide to treat it as HTML.  There&#39;s a\nwhole world of infrastructure out there which is coded to a limited\nnumber of ubiquitous media types -- don&#39;t throw that out for the sake\nof an optimization (using media types as object keys).\n\n&gt;\n&gt; A web spider blindly follows the links it finds as it is concerned\n&gt; only with following links and cataloging the response.\n&gt;\n\nDisagree.  Spiders are increasingly sophisticated, googlebot has been\ninteracting with GET forms for years now.  Google understands the\nGoodRelations ontology, with increased quality of search results as the\nbenefit for any site that implements it.  None of which applies when a\ncustom media type is used.  This only works because the semantics are\nexpressed using a standardized ontology for domain-specific vocabulary,\nwhich has no bearing on the media type (works with any markup language\nthat supports RDFa); this is the component layer in REST.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; A web spider doesn&#39;t need understand the semantic meaning of the\n&gt; response and it doesn&#39;t need to use that information to choose the\n&gt; proper link to follow.\n&gt; \n\nLike a web spider, an m2m client needs to understand what URIs in the\ncontent constitute links, first.  The choice is made by comparing the\nlink relations available, against the machine-user goal.  If the goal\nis to use my v2 API to submit a media type application, an m2m client\nshould first check to see if it&#39;s already registered (which assumes some\nfuture, machine-readable IANA registry); it knows where to look by\nsearching for &lt;link rel=&#39;index&#39;/&gt; (which I just added) by its Xpath.\nThat&#39;s part of the paragraph of out-of-band documentation my API\nrequires.\n\nIf the m2m client just came from there, to find the application form,\nthere&#39;s no need to dereference it.  Either way, the m2m client knows\nthe links for each top-level type, so this operation matches the link\ntext to the text in the form&#39;s dropdown box for the selected type, and\nthe subtype-name search continues.  If the question is, how does the\nm2m client know how to find the application form from the index page,\nI&#39;d stick role=&#39;form&#39; on the link.  A bit of a hack, I&#39;m sure there are\nbetter ways, but I believe mechanisms do exist within (X)HTML to\nannotate links in such a way that machines can follow them.\n\nIf the question is, how does the m2m client *infer* all of this vs.\nhaving to be coded against this interface, I&#39;m confused because I don&#39;t\nsee where this capability exists in any architectural style, or how\ndefining custom media types would be a solution even if it were RESTful\nto do so for such purpose.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
