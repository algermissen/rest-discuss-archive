Any good tools out there that are simple, but allow you to \n&gt; issue HTTP POST/PUT/DELETEs easily?\n\nAnteater is pretty good:\n\nhttp://aft.sourceforge.net/\n\nEasy use of HTTP, regexps and XPaths to make assertions on the\nresults. Integrates nicely with Ant, so if you&#39;re building apps in\nJava it&#39;s a doddle to add the tests to your normal build process.\n\nAnd then there&#39;s Grinder for load testing:\n\nhttp://grinder.sourceforge.net/\n\nScales very well across machines, and you can script interactions\nusing Python.\n\nCheers,\n\nL.\n--\nhttp://www.ldodds.com/blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
