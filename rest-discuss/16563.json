They how come it seems like just about every response on this\n&gt; and related threads comes back with something to the effect of IANA\n&gt; registration is the *only* way to go if you want to be RESTful?\n&gt; \n\nBecause the alternative is to say, &quot;unregistered identifiers are self-\ndescriptive&quot; which is irrational, given that Roy has said, &quot;Self-\ndescriptiveness means that the type is registered...&quot;\n\nI&#39;m not a purist, because I don&#39;t insist that REST be used when REST\nisn&#39;t appropriate.  I&#39;m only being rational when I insist that self-\ndescriptive messaging requires registered identifiers -- if REST on the\nWeb is a system&#39;s goal, then it&#39;s irrational to use identifiers Roy has\ndeclared not to be self-descriptive.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; That constraints &quot;matter&quot; DOES NOT imply any requirement.  It just\n&gt; means, well, that they matter.  As someone who has worked for years on\n&gt; developing standards at the IETF, W3C, and OASIS, this semantic\n&gt; confusion isn&#39;t even a close call, and the semantics do matter.\n&gt; \n\nThis isn&#39;t what Roy has said regarding whether systems that disregard\nREST constraints may be labeled REST:\n\n&quot;What needs to be done to make the REST architectural style clear on\nthe notion that hypertext is a constraint? In other words, if the\nengine of application state (and hence the API) is not being driven by\nhypertext, then it cannot be RESTful and cannot be a REST API. Period.\nIs there some broken manual somewhere that needs to be fixed?&quot;\n\nSubstitute self-descriptive messaging, or any other constraint, for\nhypermedia there.  Otherwise, we can call anything REST, even systems\nwhich have nothing to do with standardized data types with registered\nidentifiers.  How does it help anyone achieve the goals of REST on the\nWeb, to not point out when constraints are being violated?\n\n&gt; \n&gt; On top of that, specifications get it wrong.  Maybe the RFCs are\n&gt; wrong? A few years back, I saw someone point out an error in the HTTP\n&gt; specification, almost six years after it was published.  Maybe Roy is\n&gt; wrong?  Maybe the W3C is wrong with some of its TAG findings?  How do\n&gt; we know, except to challenge assumptions, and follow those\n&gt; discussions to their conclusions?  Instead, you seem determined to\n&gt; shut off debate.\n&gt; \n\nNo, I share the same goals as you.  The folks shutting off this debate\nare the ones who keep bringing it back to a matter of me, personally.\nLike for example, stating that it&#39;s only &quot;my&quot; interpretation of REST\nwhere &quot;self-descriptive messaging means that the type is registered,&quot;\nwhen that&#39;s a direct Roy quote.  If Roy&#39;s wrong, then by all means\nfolks, enlighten me as to why instead of insinuating that this is only\n&quot;my&quot; requirement.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; That is not &quot;my&quot; interpretation, and there is no room for\n&gt; &gt; &quot;alternate&quot; interpretations, where the Web is concerned.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, er, except, there is.  That&#39;s the beauty of the chaos that is\n&gt; the web.  There are about two billion people [1] connected to it, and\n&gt; all of them are entitled to their own interpretations.  If they see a\n&gt; better way, let&#39;s welcome them, and learn from them.\n&gt; \n\nIn general, I agree with you.  However, Roy is an authority on what\nconstitutes REST, and Roy says &quot;self-descriptive messaging means that\nthe type is registered.&quot;  As with any hard science, I require\nfalsifiability -- tell me why that statement is wrong, not that I&#39;m\nwrong to insist on it.  I don&#39;t see how it amounts to falsification, to\nattribute that point to me, then declare that it&#39;s OK to disregard it.\nIs there really some alternate interpretation of REST besides Roy&#39;s?\n\n&gt; \n&gt; As someone who follows issues surrounding computer security closely,\n&gt; the distinction between intranet/internet is a convenient short-hand,\n&gt; but doesn&#39;t actually exist in practice.  Many &quot;closed&quot; systems send\n&gt; their traffic over the internet, sometimes via VPN, sometimes not,\n&gt; sometimes over HTTP, and sometimes not.\n&gt; \n\nOf course.  But for any &quot;open&quot; system attempting Internet scale by\nfollowing REST on the Web, those payoffs are achieved by playing by the\nrules (registering in IANA), not looking for loopholes and expecting\nREST&#39;s promises to hold true.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m only interested in helping folks with REST development for the\n&gt; &gt; &quot;common case of the Web&quot;,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; OK. if you&#39;re only interested in that, then why don&#39;t you let the rest\n&gt; of us who are interested in other scenarios, actually talk about those\n&gt; other scenarios, without barging in and telling us that what we&#39;re\n&gt; doing is wrong for a different use-case that you&#39;re interested in?\n&gt;\n\nI&#39;ve only &quot;barged in&quot; to make this point, where the context has been\n&quot;open&quot; systems targeted at the Web.  I&#39;ve consistently stated that this\nis not a big deal otherwise, IOW, I have been limiting my comments to\nthe &quot;common case of the Web&quot; use-case I&#39;m interested in.\n\nWhen the rest of you start talking about how standardization of data\ntypes has nothing to do with the style, on the Web, then *somebody* has\nto point out that such systems are really some other style that&#39;s\ndistinctly different from REST, otherwise the thread would be off-topic.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m specifically not interested in your use case, so I&#39;ve actually\n&gt; come to conclude that your responses are mostly worth ignoring.\n&gt; Repeating them over and over with respect to your scenario won&#39;t\n&gt; change my mind, whereas addressing my scenarios might.\n&gt; \n\nIf you&#39;re talking about using nonstandardized types with unregistered\nidentifiers without using the Web, you&#39;ll have no worries from me -- the\nonly thing I&#39;ve ever said in such a case is, why are you bothering with\nREST if you&#39;re not interested in any of the benefits from the style,\nand have no intention to follow its constraints?  We&#39;d both have each\nother on ignore.\n\nFor those folks who do give a damn about Internet scale, it&#39;s essential\nto point out the difference between tightly-coupled library-based APIs\nand REST&#39;s uniform interface, because optimization within the model\nleads to real-world benefits which *are* the goal in such scenarios.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Really?  Advice implies opinion.\n&gt;\n\nMy advice for those looking for Internet scale in their distributed\nhypermedia systems for the Web, i.e. the &quot;common case,&quot; is to follow\nREST.  That&#39;s an opinion.  It is not an opinion, but rather an\nauthoritative, normative reference, to point out that Roy&#39;s definition\nof the term self-descriptive requires the identifier to be registered.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; If the question on the table applies to a different use case, can you\n&gt; please discuss from that alternate perspective, or simply hold your\n&gt; peace?\n&gt; \n\nWhere have I done otherwise?  If you look back far enough in this\nthread, what touched me off was the guy from Microsoft being led to\nbelieve that nonstandardized, unregistered types are congruous with the\nREST style, when his context is the &quot;common case of the Web.&quot;\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
