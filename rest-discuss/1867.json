I mean to point out that SOAP makes no syntactic demands\non protocols and almost no semantic ones. I believe that SOAP is\nsufficiently &quot;flexible&quot; that ANSI X12 are *already legal SOAP messages*.\nThis is in contrast to REST which is much more prescriptive.\n\n&gt;....\n&gt; 1. The documents exchanged are not XML, but people have converted the\n&gt; EDI formats to XML, without much takeup.\n\nSure, but SOAP messages do not have to be XML, according to the SOAP\nspecification.\n\n&gt; 2. The most common message exchange pattern for traditional EDI is\n&gt; batch over a VAN, that is, possible very large batches of documents\n&gt; being sent periodically, often weekly.  Not very SOAPy.  Or RESTful,\n&gt; either.\n\nBut SOAP explicitly supports any message exchange pattern.\n\nDoes that clarify the question? I&#39;m asking if SOAP is *so* flexibly\ndescriptive (rather than prescriptive) that any arbitrary pre-existing\nprotocol can be declared &quot;SOAP compliant&quot; without any change. Probably\nfew people would be silly enough to do this (but who can see the future)\nbut even if not, it seems to me to exemplify the opposite attidudes of\nthe REST literature versus the SOAP model. REST expresses constraints on\ncomponents and messages. SOAP seems designed to express as few\nconstraints as possible.\n-- \nCome discuss XML and REST web services at:\n  Open Source Conference: July 22-26, 2002, conferences.oreillynet.com\n  Extreme Markup: Aug 4-9, 2002,  www.extrememarkup.com/extreme/\n\n"}}
