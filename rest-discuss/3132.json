So far, I just cannot see how\nthis\n&gt; &gt; could be enforced.  Between the moment that the PUT was completed and a\n&gt; &gt; subsequent GET was requested, the resource could have been updated (via\n&gt; &gt; PUTs, if you want) several times.  There is no mechanism in HTTP to\n&gt; perform\n&gt; &gt; a PUT-followed-by-GET as an atomic operation.  As a result, it seems\nthat\n&gt; &gt; one should *ever* expect the representation sent with a PUT to be the\nsame\n&gt; &gt; as the representation retrieved with a GET, at least as a general rule.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt; &gt; seairth@...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
