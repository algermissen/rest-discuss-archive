Authentication is easy, and nicely taken care of by the \nservlet container.  It&#39;s the Authentication that becomes more difficult. \n  What we&#39;re looking for is a framework that allows us to plug in rules \nfor authorization and ask the question &quot;Can User U PUT Data D?&quot; easily. \n  I haven&#39;t seen much in controling PUT and DELETE.  I would love to do \nit in the Apache level, much like I can control GET there.\n\nSeth\n\r\n--------------ms020600060901070508000806\r\nContent-Type: application/x-pkcs7-signature; name=&quot;smime.p7s&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;smime.p7s&quot;\r\nContent-Description: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--------------ms020600060901070508000806--\r\n\n"}}
