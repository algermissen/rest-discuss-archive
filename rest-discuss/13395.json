There may be some complex business process that may\n&gt; govern order cancellation. Using POST gives the server an opportunity\n&gt; to provide a decent abstraction for the order cancellation process  \n&gt; provided that the body of the representation for POST includes  \n&gt; information about the cancellation request.\n&gt; \n\nThe key point being, &quot;provided that the body of the representation for\nPOST includes information about the cancellation request.&quot;\n\n&gt;\n&gt; It is okay to argue that the first is RESTful while the second is\n&gt; not, but it does not help very much. There are two competing\n&gt; requirements here. One is visibility, and the other is separation of\n&gt; concerns. Using PUT maintains visibility, but will most likely force\n&gt; the client to know who/when it is valid to flip the flag to true or\n&gt; false. Using POST reduces visibility, but maintains a cleaner\n&gt; separation of concerns.\n&gt; \n\nI think it helps a lot, for the very reason you mentioned.  The second\noption is just plain wrong because there&#39;s no HEAS invovled.  Which is\nnot to say that the first option is the only way to go -- there are some\nideas in this thread that could be turned into a RESTful interaction,\nlike /cancelled/333, but they aren&#39;t fleshed out.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; A lot of problems being discussed on this thread often come down to  \n&gt; this point. You can have absolute visibility with poor separation of  \n&gt; concerns, or partial visibility with better separation of concerns.  \n&gt; Since these are networked/distributed systems, I would go with the  \n&gt; latter.\n&gt; \n\nI don&#39;t follow, Subbu.  How does the first approach fail re: separation\nof concerns?  Also, why isn&#39;t the full visibility of a RESTful approach\nnot favorable in a distributed system?\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
