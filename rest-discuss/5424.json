For\nexample, if you GET a URI and receive back a text/html document, and you\n(or some automaton working on your behalf) want to change that document,\nthen there&#39;s an expectation that you simply need to make the edit\nlocally, then PUT it back with the same media type.  That&#39;s why RDF\nForms didn&#39;t support PUT, because I couldn&#39;t think of a scenario where\nthat interaction needed any additional information from the server.  On\nthe other hand, &quot;couldn&#39;t think of&quot; wreaks of trying to anticipate the\nunanticipated, which is why I&#39;m adding it in (I&#39;m doing a complete\nrewrite, in fact, at Dan Connolly&#39;s request).\n\n&gt; If so, using some kind of forms language, does this also mean that I\n&gt; need to do this for every resource and method in my system, so should\n&gt; each representation of my widgets include some forms stuff saying what\n&gt; to PUT to update it?\n\nFor PUT, maybe not.  POST always needs parameterizing (i.e. the\n&quot;additional information&quot; I mentioned) though, since unlike PUT, the\nmedia type of the representation returned over GET to the URI doesn&#39;t\nnecessarily have anything to do with the media type accepted on a POST.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
