Also suppose that\n&gt; the only way to tell the services which machine&#39;s manual I need to see\n&gt; is via a URI. I would have to issue requests such as\n&gt;\n&gt; GET\n/documentation/manuals?item=http://www.brandX.com/products/air-contitioners#\nXYZ\n&gt;\n&gt; (not url encoded for clarity)\n&gt;\n&gt; Would there be any way to put the air conditioner&#39;s URI into the service&#39;s\n&gt; URI other than via a query string ?\nIf this is not purely a pass-through - the brandX.com is a registered data\nentity on your server - then you don&#39;t have to have http: in there. You\nwould use an id that your server knew about, do the lookup to the base URL\nfor the third party, and merge some text strings.\n\nIf you don&#39;t need the protocol portion, you can just put it in a path\nsegment (between the &#39;/&#39; characters). You can define for your internal\nimplementation that any segments past a certain point are part of the other\nsite.\n\nGET /documentation/manuals/www.brandX.com/products/air-contitioners#XYZ\n\nIf you do need the protocol, then you probably need a query string.\n\n\n\n"}}
