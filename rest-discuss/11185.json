The resource /books may be\nqueried, looks like.  You can make hierarchical URIs if you&#39;d like, and\nsee them as &quot;stored queries&quot; but this is a matter of usability and not\none of architecture.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Then I thought about a hierarchy\n&gt; /books/{category}/{year}\n&gt; but then I would also need\n&gt; /books/{year}/{category}\n&gt; But this makes it seem like one category is a child of year or vice\n&gt; versa which isn&#39;t correct.  Plus as I add filters I&#39;d need all sorts\n&gt; of combinations.\n&gt; \n\nI don&#39;t understand why you&#39;d need both.  Here&#39;s what I&#39;d do:\n\n/books\n/books/year\n/books/category\n/books/category/year\n\nBut, no /books/year/category is needed, as it&#39;s just a URI alias\nfor /books/category/year -- both URIs identify the same resource.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The other option I read about involves putting them at the same level\n&gt; separated by a comma or semicolon:\n&gt; /books/{year},{category}\n&gt; But then seems king of messy since it&#39;s possible to omit a filter and\n&gt; then I&#39;d have something like\n&gt; /books/,sci-fi\n&gt; \n\nYuck. ;-)\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
