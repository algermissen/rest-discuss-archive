What he means may be =\r\nbest explained by a\n&gt; simple example.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Assume we have a resource th=\r\nat represents a folder,\n&gt; and by issueing a POST request, I can attach a fi=\r\nle. What,\n&gt; however, if that post request wrongly goes to, let&#39;s say,\n&gt; ano=\r\nther document resource instead of our folder, and the\n&gt; document resource a=\r\nlso accepts POST (for some reason)?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In a RPC world, the document t=\r\nype would not understand\n&gt; an &quot;addDocument()&quot; call, and consequently return=\r\n an\n&gt; exception. But what about REST? Of course, the POST&#39;s\n&gt; attributes mo=\r\nst likely wouldn&#39;t be understood and something\n&gt; like 400 Bad Request retur=\r\nned. But what if they were\n&gt; understood?\n&gt; \n&gt; Ah, yes, a similar thing happ=\r\nens all the time when\n&gt; flaying frisbee in the park with my dog.=A0 When I\n=\r\n&gt; throw\n&gt; the frisbee and the dog tries to catch it in his teeth,\n&gt; everyon=\r\ne seems to be happy.=A0 However, when the dog\n&gt; tries\n&gt; to throw the frisbe=\r\ne and I try to catch it in my teeth,\n&gt; it just doesn&#39;t seem to work well fo=\r\nr either of us.\n\n&gt;&gt; Roy, I hope this email finds your dog well. \nSorry to d=\r\nouble check on this image, but IMHO, images are a very good mean to transpo=\r\nrt abstract things like REST to customers. So, it&#39;d prefer to have things c=\r\nlear.\nSo, you&#39;re suggesting that you are the server, the frisbee is the req=\r\nuest, and the dog is the client? And *if* you are sending a bad message in =\r\nthe form of a poor shot or a very mal-formed frisbee, the dog won&#39;t be able=\r\n to catch it? Thanks for clarification.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; So, are there means or patt=\r\nerns, to achieve (some\n&gt; sort) of type safety?\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes.=A0 A RESTful inter=\r\nface is one where the server\n&gt; provides the links\n&gt; or forms that tells the=\r\n client what operations to perform\n&gt; where.\n&gt; If you are telling the client=\r\n to do the wrong thing, then\n&gt; the\n&gt; pattern would be to tell the client to=\r\n do the right thing\n&gt; instead.\n&gt; Generally speaking, it works out better th=\r\nat way.\n\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for reminding me of the basic things in REST-life. Clear=\r\nly the way to go. \nThis just raises me one question. How would you flag to =\r\nthe client a link that is cool and MAY BE persisted, versus one that is of =\r\ntransient nature? \n\nThanks,\n-- Juerg\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; ....Roy\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n      \n\n"}}
