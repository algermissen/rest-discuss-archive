I surely did not...\n\n\n&gt; The point with idempotency (to me) is that the side effect is the same\n&gt; and in this case, it would/could be in that the topmost element is\n&gt; removed from the queue.  If the DELETE is done 1 or 20 times, the\n&gt; topmost element is popped.\n\nI think the point with idempotency is that you can if necessary\nretransmit the request without any ill-effect. In our case, issuing\nDELETE /foo/top multiple times (because maybe the connection was\ninterrupted on the first try and you never received a response code)\nwill not have the desired effect at all.\n\n\n&gt; (I think another mistake is that we interpret the verbs to mean how\n&gt; the server MUST behave whereas the verbs are for the client to\n&gt; communicate their expectation.  The server can ultimately do what it\n&gt; wants, only that the client is not responsible.)\n\nOf course the server can do what it wants. If it does offer this option\nand the client choses to use it then the consequences may be very much\nnot what either side expected.\n\nI think the better idea is to find out the ID of the top element (using\nHEAD or GET) on /foo/top and then doing a DELETE only on /foo/&lt;id&gt;.\n\nIt would be safest if the server wouldn&#39;t allow DELETE on /foo/top.\n\nJuergen\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; On Thu, Aug 5, 2010 at 4:56 PM, Juergen Brendel\n&gt; &lt;juergen.brendel@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;         \n&gt;         Hello!\n&gt;         \n&gt;         \n&gt;         I think the issue is that GET has to be &#39;side effect free&#39;,\n&gt;         not that it\n&gt;         always has to return the same data. For example, if you view\n&gt;         the current\n&gt;         time as a resource then GETing it will give you always\n&gt;         different values,\n&gt;         but those may well change, since &#39;current time&#39; in itself is a\n&gt;         changing\n&gt;         resource. Nothing you (the client) does changes its value. The\n&gt;         value\n&gt;         changes whether you make the request or not.\n&gt;         \n&gt;         However, DELETEing the top of a queue that&#39;s stored on a\n&gt;         server actively\n&gt;         changes stuff on the server, which means that you making the\n&gt;         request has\n&gt;         a real effect. Thus, it&#39;s not idempotent.\n&gt;         \n&gt;         Juergen\n&gt;         \n&gt;         \n&gt;         On Thu, 2010-08-05 at 16:51 -0400, Eb wrote:\n&gt;         &gt;\n&gt;         &gt; On Thu, Aug 5, 2010 at 4:26 PM, Nick Gall\n&gt;         &lt;nick.gall@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;         \n&gt;         &gt;\n&gt;         \n&gt;         &gt; What do you consider &quot;same effect&quot; here?
