And therei=\r\nn is the significant distinction. A\nREST-conformant user agent would proces=\r\ns the form or URI template and\npresent it decently to the user only because=\r\n the media type dictates a\nset of shared conventions. (For example, HTML do=\r\ncuments in the World\nWide Web are HTML documents because their media-type l=\r\nabel is\n&quot;text/html&quot;. If one changes the label to &quot;text/plain&quot;, the entity b=\r\nody\nhas lost most of its meaning and is no longer HTML.) The cookie is\nopaq=\r\nue to the user agent (and to connectors and to intermediary\ncomponents).\n\n&gt;=\r\n Note that the cookie is to be used 1.\n&gt; to construct the proper uri for th=\r\ne resource (by including the username,\n&gt; which is the value of the cookie) =\r\nin the uri\n\nDid you mean &quot;Note that the cookie is to be used to construct t=\r\nhe proper\nURI for the resource (by including the username, which is the val=\r\nue of\nthe cookie, in the URI)&quot;? If that is what you meant, did you also mea=\r\nn\nthat the user agent would construct the URI from the cookie? I don&#39;t\nknow=\r\n of such a practice, so I&#39;m curious to read about it. If, instead,\nyou mean=\r\n that the origin server would construct the URI from the cookie,\nthen we ha=\r\nve a situation in which the user agent is clueless about the\nmeaning of the=\r\n cookie and we are back to a violation\n\n&gt; [the cookie is to be used] in con=\r\njunction with\n&gt; another cookie (which contains a hash of &lt;a secret key + us=\r\nename&gt;) to\n&gt; provide a means to authenticate the request.\n\nHere, again, we =\r\nwould have a violation of the constraint of\nself-descriptive messages. Cook=\r\nies are not defined as vehicles for\nauthentication credentials.\n\n&gt; [...] it=\r\n&#39;s not\n&gt; correct to say that cookies in HTTP always violate REST (to the ex=\r\ntent\n&gt; that we have a common understanding of &quot;in HTTP,&quot; &quot;violate,&quot; and &quot;RE=\r\nST&quot;\n&gt; which may, I suppose, not be the case).\n\nI think that we have a commo=\r\nn understanding of the phrases &quot;in HTTP&quot; and\n&quot;violate&quot;. I am unsure about w=\r\nhether we have a common understanding of\n&quot;REST&quot;, but I think that our under=\r\nstandings of &quot;REST&quot; are close enough\nthat the discussion is beneficial.\n\n--=\r\n \nPlease do not reply to me when replying to rest-discuss.
