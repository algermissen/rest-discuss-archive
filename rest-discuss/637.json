How those requests actually get from end to end ---\ni.e., connection directionality, etc. --- are out of scope, but there are\nvarious options, cf. [1]  In general, the formula for dealing with this\nrequires an external and open &quot;rendezvous&quot; server coupled with a tunnel that\nallows a requests to flow downstream and responses upstream over a long-lived\nGET connection to a resource on the rendezvous server.\n\njb\n\n[1] http://internet.conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/SwitchboardPattern\n\n\n\n"}}
