HTTP spec is in\naccordance with the rules here, in terms of the Accept header being\nnon-authorative. script and style elements already ammend accept header (in\nfirefox) but not for other link elements. This behaviour would be valuable for\nenabling HTML powered applications which leverage HTTP conneg.\n\n\n------- /Comment #1 From Ian &#39;Hixie&#39; Hickson &lt;mailto:ian@...&gt; \n2009-09-22 11:49:32/ -------\n\nAccept should reflect what the UA accepts, not what the page says the server\nprovides.\n\n\n\n------- /Comment #2 From Mike Kelly &lt;mailto:mike@...&gt; \n2009-09-22 12:48:01/ -------\n\nIan that would appear to be incorrect given that, according to the HTTP spec,\nthe Accept header is simply intended to indicate the appropriate media types\nfor a response to a given request:\n\nhttp://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html\n\n&quot;The Accept request-header field can be used to specify certain media types\nwhich are acceptable for the response&quot;\n\nSo, the value of the Accept header should be taken (if specified) from the type\nattribute for a given hyperlink element - which is presumably why firefox\nmodifies the accept header for the style and script elements.\n\nThis allows hyperlinks to specific representations that must be negotiated via\nHTTP content negotiation - as it stands, it is not possible to specify such a\nlink with HTML5.\n\ni.e. currently - these links would actually generate identical requests with\nthe same Accept header: \n\n&lt;a type=&#39;application/xml&#39; href=&#39;/document&#39;&gt;document in xml&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a type=&#39;application/json&#39; href=&#39;/document&#39;&gt;document in json&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf implemented any existing mechanisms which disregard the Accept header would\nremain unaffected by the change. \n\nIf no type is specified then default UA Accept header value should be assumed.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
