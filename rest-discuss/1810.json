If there\n&gt; is a reason why this is a bad idea, I want to hear it.\n\nI&#39;m not familiar with the Gnutella protocol. Maybe you could outline the\nmajor message types, resource types and addressing facilities or point\nto a good summarizing URI.\n\nTo me the most fundamental problem is the same problem with all p2p\napps: clients can be behind NAT and have no global addresses. So yes,\nyou do need a TURN/ETRN and it won&#39;t be backwards compatible. My\ninstinct is to have the client open a socket and ask for a backchannel\nwith a POST. The server creates a &quot;listener&quot; and returns the port number\nand maybe some authentication data. The client connects *not* using HTTP\nbut using a &quot;reversible socket protocol&quot;. The client and server\nunderstand that on the reversed socket they have swapped roles.\n\nYou can push the idea beyond HTTP. Reversable FTP would allow machines\nbehind firewalls to publish FTP servers by pushing a reversed FTP\nconnection to a &quot;publishing intermediary.&quot; Same with reversable telnet.\nI don&#39;t have time right now to think through exactly how this differs\nfrom regular port forwarding but it feels like push versus pull. I can\ntell SSH: &quot;forward FTP requests to my laptop&quot; but I can&#39;t tell it: &quot;wait\nfor a signal from the laptop and then and only then should you forward\nFTP requests.&quot; Of course I can organize this connection out-of-band in a\nproprietary way.\n\nI doubt this idea is compatible with all existing infrastructure, but\nthere is no solution that will be 100% compatible with existing\ninfrastructure *except* tunnelling. By definition turning the existing\none-way architecture into a two-way one requires either extension or\ntunnelling. If you care about the marketability of your protocol, it\nshould probably provide both options.\n-- \nCome discuss XML and REST web services at:\n  Open Source Conference: July 22-26, 2002, conferences.oreillynet.com\n  Extreme Markup: Aug 4-9, 2002,  www.extrememarkup.com/extreme/\n\n"}}
