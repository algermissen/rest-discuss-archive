SET could be used with\n&gt; SOAP, while PUT can&#39;t (at least as you&#39;d expect it to be used).\n\nThe SOAP PUT issue was actually one of the issues that I was \nwondering about.  How could it really work at all?\n\nDo you envision this &quot;SET&quot; method allowing partial resource updates?\n\n\n"}}
