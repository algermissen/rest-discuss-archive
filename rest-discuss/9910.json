(read:non-scripted) clients, you are bound to build all\nthe state into the delivered resource (a &lt;form&gt; with hidden elements\nfor html). in that case, you have a unique resource that requires a\nunique URI.\n\nthe querystring argument model can help in creating unique URIs, but\nonly to a point, right?  in the case where you use qs details to carry\nor identify state, you always need to make sure the &#39;naked&#39; resource\nURI results in something resonable for the client.\n\nnot having code-on-demand for the client can really complicate the work.\n\nmca\n\nOn 12/2/07, Karen &lt;karen.cravens@...&gt; wrote:\n&lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; Like a newsreader&#39;s newsrc file, you mean?  Because yeah, exactly, is\n&gt; what I&#39;d do with JS *if* I could depend on it being there, and didn&#39;t\n&gt; mind the overhead of two http requests: pull the newsrc-line\n&gt; equivalent with a user-specific URL (to continue the newsrc analogy,\n&gt; that would be part of the subscription resource), and run down the\n&gt; list of posts on the thread page and flag all the ones that are unread\n&gt; based on that newsrc.\n&gt;\n&gt; Except then that leads to the question of whether it&#39;s really much of\n&gt; a leap to ask the server to do combining that for you, to support\n&gt; those dumb clients.  Perhaps http://domain/threadlocationbit for the\n&gt; canonical and ...threadlocationbit?someflag=set for the customized\n&gt; one, where the latter returns the canonical version in the\n&gt; Content-Location header, and such other stuff as is needed to make\n&gt; sure smarter clients don&#39;t mistake it for other than the compromise it\n&gt; is.\n&lt;/snip&gt;\n\n"}}
