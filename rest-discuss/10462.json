It will\n&gt; emphasize not using RPC style methods but if you must it should use\n&gt; safe semantics.\n\nThat&#39;s the start of a very slippery slope.  You&#39;re basically encouraging the \nOO folks to tunnel RPC over HTTP.\n\nI think we&#39;ve had enough discussions of why that is not such a good idea on \nthe rest forums already.\n\nBut you just proved my point...thanks!\n\n&gt; Obviously I&#39;m biased for it but I think it&#39;s a good way to develop an\n&gt; application, because the user&#39;s interface will map the domain model.\n\nThat doesn&#39;t work in the world of machine to machine communications, since it \nis rare that disparate systems have common domain or object models.  \n\nThe better approach in that scenario is to design a data representation \nformat that is better suited to the integration and transmission of \ninformation, rather than cater to internal implementation models on both \nsides.\n\n&gt; As we can use URIs to identify objects we can save those in other\n&gt; systems, so we are planning to use URIs for every inter application\n&gt; references, which lends itself to very easy integration. \n\nI beg to differ.  Common/consistent URI&#39;s are a help, but a properly designed \ndata representation, with concomittent semantic definitions, independent of \nback end domain/object models is what makes integration easier, though even \nat the best of times, integration is still hard.\n\n\n&gt; Also if the\n&gt; only interface to your app is via REST, everything can be an WS\n&gt; without additional effort.\n\nWhat you&#39;re doing isn&#39;t REST for the most part.  It&#39;s using HTTP as a \ntransport mechanism for RPC and inter-object distributed communications.\n\n It&#39;s also great because you think much more\n&gt; about your domain and don&#39;t worry with user interfaces, because this\n&gt; problem is solved, so essentially you know that in the interface you\n&gt; can just navigate via URIs and find what do you want (e.g.\n&gt; /authors/Joe_Blogger/posts?published=false) which makes much easier to\n&gt; write ajax widgets in the app without up front design.\n\nYou are mixing metaphors.  Integration is not an Ajax-based activity \n(usually), since Ajax is geared towards user UIs, not machine to machine \nintegration, the latter being the much harder problem to solve, and providing \nmuch more benefit when it is solved (think healthcare for a good example of \nthis).\n\n\nAndrzej Jan Taramina\nChaeron Corporation: Enterprise System Solutions\nhttp://www.chaeron.com\n\n\n"}}
