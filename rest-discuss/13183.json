It has the following protocol:\n\nGET    /profiles - returns a list of user profiles\nPOST  /profiles - adds a new user profile\n\nGET   /profiles/{userid} - gets the user profile of the specified user\nPUT   /profiles/{userid} - update the user profile  (non-browser)\nPOST /profiles/{userid} - update the user profile (browser)\n\netc.\n\nI&#39;d like it to work such that when a user does a GET\n/profiles/{userid}, the html representation that is returned either\ncontains a link to a form to be used to edit the profile data, or\ndirectly contains the form for editing.  For the former the form could\nbe located at /profiles/{userid}?editform.  In both cases, the form\nwould be POSTed to /profiles/{userid}\n\nI don&#39;t feel strongly about either option and expect usability\nrequirements or implementation details to guide me here (though I am\ninterested in opinions if somebody thinks there&#39;s a better way).\n\nMy real question has to do with providing a mechanism to create new\nusers.  I&#39;m really not sure what a good pattern for this might be.  I\ncan think of three possiblities:\n\n1.  GET  /profiles/newuser to get the form, and POST to /profiles\nThis one kind of messes with the implied namespace of\n/profiles/{userid} in the newuser isnt really a userid\n\n2. GET /profiles/ to get the form and POST to /profiles\nI think this is too subtle a distinction and probably has the\ncollection semantics wrong\n\n3. GET /profiles?newuser and POST to /profiles\nI dont have any real objection to this one at this point.\n\n\nOption 3 seems like a winner, but I&#39;m curious as to what other options\nthere might be.  Thoughts?\n\n\n--Chuck\n\n"}}
