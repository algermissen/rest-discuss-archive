It results in the problems that were al=\r\nready\n&gt; described and quoted by Bill.\n&gt; \n&gt; Agent-driven negotiation is far =\r\nmore effective, but there was a huge\n&gt; disagreement between myself and the =\r\nchair of the HTTP working group\n&gt; and my original agent-driven design for H=\r\nTTP/1.1 was effectively\n&gt; buried in committee.\n&gt; \n&gt; To do negotiation right=\r\n, the client needs to be aware of all the\n&gt; alternatives *and* what it shou=\r\nld use as a bookmark.  In HTTP/1.1,\n&gt; all we managed to standardize is 300 =\r\nand Vary.  We needed Alternates\n&gt; and Link to make it work.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the fac=\r\nt is that different languages do not produce equivalents.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; There are hu=\r\nndreds of nuances, colloquialisms, and shared social\n&gt; &gt;&gt; norms that simply=\r\n do not translate.  We encourage resource owners\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to only use true cont=\r\nent negotiation (without redirects) when the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; only difference between f=\r\normats is mechanical in nature.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Are you saying that true content ne=\r\ngotiation should only be done for\n&gt; &gt; stuff like changing formats (like whe=\r\nn you have a base XML and you\n&gt; &gt; convert it into PDF, HTML, etc.) and not =\r\nfor languages?\n&gt; \n&gt; I am saying that all important resources must have URIs=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; ....Roy\n&gt;\n\nEntire discussion is about whether representation meta da=\r\nta be\naddressed via Accept headers than through query string. If I am wrong=\r\n\njust leave it at this point itself.\n\nResource can be reached by some URI, =\r\nand kind of representation\nreturned depends what kind of representation is =\r\nrequested by reading\nAccept-headers. Even if there are more than one repres=\r\nentations\navailable, ideally they all represent same state of a resource. I=\r\nf we\nsplit the URI space with respect to different languages to address the=\r\n\nlocalization issue, it may lead to peculiar problems. One of which I\nwould=\r\n like to specifically point out is *Authorization*. \n\nNormally we to build =\r\nauthorization for resources rather than\nrepresentations (Please correct me =\r\nif I am wrong). If we build\napplication with URI name space splitting for l=\r\nocalization, then it\nmay happen for example, that French speaking people ar=\r\ne able to access\nan URI which English speaking people are not able to acces=\r\ns.\n\nExample:\n       English speaking people accessing user information\n    =\r\n   http://www.example.com/user/abc?lang=3Den\n\n       French speaking people=\r\n accessing user information\n       http://www.example.com/user/abc?lang=3Df=\r\nr\n\n    Authorization system must use complete URI to authorize the\nrequest,=\r\n one just can&#39;t drop the query string to get the URI\nhttp://www.example.com=\r\n/user/abc because query string parametrizes the\nresource and may have some =\r\napplication specific parameters. One can\ndiscard the lang parameter of the =\r\nquery string, but isn&#39;t that\nunnecessary programming effort? What if there =\r\nare alternate\nrepresentations available like HTML, pdf, text, etc.? then th=\r\nis\nproblem just compounds making the application more complex\nunnecessarily=\r\n. Instead if Accept headers are used, URI is same across\nany locale or repr=\r\nesentation. and it becomes very easy to administer\nthe authorization.\n\nOne =\r\nissue I am not able to address though is bit representation\nspecific, somet=\r\nhing like pdf version is only available to specific\npeople (like people who=\r\n pay for that service).\n\nI am still a novice to ReST, so lack the ReST voca=\r\nbulary. And I\nspammed someones mailbox (I think twice), I guess. Sorry for =\r\nthe same.\nI just did not check the To select box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
