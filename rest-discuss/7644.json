However, I suggest that secure communications is one of\nthose areas where the assumptions that REST are based on do not hold so\ntightly.\n\nSecret data has fewer scalability concerns than widely known data,\nbecause secrecy itself is not scalable. You don&#39;t expect a million or\neven a thousand clients to all ask for the statement on a particular\ncredit card. You expect maybe 10 hits per day for a busy account. If a\nlot of people have access to a particular secret, it isn&#39;t very secret.\nThis is why SSL is often the right answer to secure messaging, despite\nlimiting the application of caches and the use of intermediataries for\nother purposes.\n\nBenjamin\n\n\n"}}
