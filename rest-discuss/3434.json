In many application\ndomains, it is completely reasonable to generate a\ndifferent URL in each announcment email.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n&gt; &gt;You POST credentials to a login resource and\n&gt; &gt;receive a redirect to the restricted URL.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; But how do I relate that login resource to the resources that are protected?\n\nYou have a login resource per protected resource\nor resources.\n\nOne REST pattern is that applications should\nexpose a single root URL from which you navigate\nto the others.  So the redirect should probably be\nto this root.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.

How do I restrict access to that page?  If HTTP is the protocol\n&gt; &gt;&gt;used to access resources, then it has to provide some mechanism for\n&gt; &gt;&gt;controlling access.  Where else would you suggest putting the access\n&gt; &gt;&gt;control mechanism?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; --Chuck\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
