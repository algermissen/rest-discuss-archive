An implementation question: how do I handle things when I want my\n&gt; OrderManagement system (or service) to &quot;push&quot; information out to the world.\n&gt; For instance, say my OrderManagement system has processed an order and it\n&gt; may be useful for other systems in the enterprise to be notified. At an\n&gt; architectural level, this relates to how well REST aligns with an EDA\n&gt; (event-driven architecture). At a more mechanical/implementation level it\n&gt; relates to my confusion around how REST might or might not (or is it better\n&gt; to say, &quot;should or should not&quot;) relate to tings like:\n&gt; * Atom Publishing Protocol (APP) used as a means of publishing notifictions\n&gt; * Simply having notifications being POST&#39;ed back to some pre-configured URI;\n&gt; just as Google does in their checkout API (e.g. see\n&gt; http://code.google.com/apis/checkout/developer/index.html)\n&gt; * Something like HTTP Events as presented here\n&gt; http://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?HttpEvents and here\n&gt; http://http-events.sourceforge.net/.\n\nYou can do this RESTfully or not. It is not affected by the\narchitecural nature of the webapp recieving the request from which the\nnotify originates.\n\nIn other words, you could have a REST webapp which recieves an order\nbut sends out notification of order completion by email.\n\nThe web isn&#39;t very good right now at callbacks. This is because\nbrowsers don&#39;t have webservers in them, users have firewalls and\ndynamic IP addresses and there are other, better ways to do\nasynchronous notification than HTTP (SMTP being the prime delivery\nmechanism).\n\nAs you point out, syndication is one option for asynchronous\nnotification. But it&#39;s not really asynchronous. It&#39;s just client\npolling.\n\n\n&gt; 2. A conceptual question: should I even think in terms of &quot;a service&quot; when\n&gt; it comes to REST? Is there necessarily always a &quot;service&quot; behind the RESTful\n&gt; interface that is processing the HTTP messages that are being sent to/from\n&gt; the RESTful system? I know that opening up the whole SOA versus REST\n&gt; question is a huge can of worms but I am trying to get down to even the most\n&gt; basic of questions: is the mental construct of a &quot;service&quot; a useful one when\n&gt; it comes to architecting my distributed systems using the principles of\n&gt; REST? Or is it better to say that the Resource is the conceptual primitive\n&gt; that I should be focusing on and that, as such, I should let go of any\n&gt; notion of service lingering from a numbers of years of being immersed in\n&gt; this thing called SOA? Having said that, if you look at the Google checkout\n&gt; API I mentioned previously (or my hypothetical OrderManagement system for\n&gt; that matter), there seems to be a clear &quot;service&quot; being offered there from\n&gt; the business perspective. So, is it fair to simply say that the &quot;service&quot; is\n&gt; the unit processing the HTTP requests being sent its way?\n\nI think of a service in so much as it defines (to some extent) the\nboundaries of the things that I need to look at. To me a &quot;service&quot; is\nsimply a collection of related resources, some of which don&#39;t exist\nyet.\n\n\n&gt; This is not just an exercise in philosopy because, at the end of the day, I\n&gt; think that what I am after here is some insight into how REST (as an\n&gt; architectural style) affects your analysis of what needs to be built? In\n&gt; other words, when the pure RESTifarian is trying to talk to the business to\n&gt; figure out what needs to be built, is the notion of service a part of their\n&gt; lexicon when talking to the business stakeholders?\n\nThat&#39;s a different question.\n\nYes, you have to talk about services when you&#39;re talking to business\npeople because they deal at a higher level of abstraction than\nprogrammers.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
