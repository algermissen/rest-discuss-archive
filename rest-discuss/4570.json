We&#39;ll assume that we are putting\ntogether nice RESTful services and using all these methods correctly.\nWhat happens when we start combining these dereferences? \n\nFor example:\n   POST is used to create new resources\n   GET is used to retrieve a representation of a resource\n\nOn their own they&#39;re RESTful, but combined in the\nmanner described below for querying, if I understand\nyou correctly, the whole is not as RESTful.\n\nTwo more examples:\n\nThe first is mnot&#39;s solution to the reliable POST \nproblem[1]. (Or Paul Prescod&#39;s solution[2].)\n\nThe second example is the real reason for the\nwhy this nags at me so much, in the Atom Publishing \nProtocol we are combining operations into idioms,\nthe most prevalent one being that of a collection[3]:\n\n  POST to a Collection resource to create a new subordinate resource\n    (Returns a 201 and the URI of newly created resource returned via Location: header)\n  GET on the Collection resource to retrieve a list of the subordinate resources\n  GET, PUT and DELETE on the subordinate resources act as expected.\n  \n\n[1] http://www.mnot.net/blog/2003/09/13/click_submit_only_once\n[2] http://www.prescod.net/reliable_http.html\n[3] http://intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/PaceCollectionIdiom\n\n\tThanks,\n\t-joe\n\n&gt; \n&gt; On Tue, Oct 19, 2004 at 09:54:52AM -0000, thompsonbry wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Why not GET the URI to which the POST was directed with the URI\n&gt;&gt;of the query document as a URL query parameter?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;E.g.,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;POST &lt;query-document&gt; to &lt;some-uri&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  ||\n&gt;&gt;  &#92;/\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Location: &lt;query-document-uri&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Then do a GET on:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;http://www.myorg.org/query-service?queryURI=&lt;query-document-uri&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;The queryURI parameter specifies the location of the resource whose\n&gt;&gt;representation is the query that will be answered.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Mark.\n\n\n\n"}}
