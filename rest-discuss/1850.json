Although\n&gt; I realize that URIs are opaque, I&#39;m trying to have them look reasonable\n&gt; should people see them - the problem I&#39;m having is how to differentiate\n&gt; between &quot;give me a representation of the container&quot;, and &quot;give me a\n&gt; represenation of everything inside the container&quot;, without having the\n&gt; URIs seem very verbose.\n\nWell GET should certainly be used for &quot;representation of the container.&quot;\nThe other thing could either be an &quot;associated URI&quot; or a query (which is\njust an associated URI that is &quot;extensible&quot; by the client).\n\n&gt; One approach I&#39;ve been consider is to model &quot;Get the list of containers\n&gt; in the service&quot; as:\n&gt;   UC1: GET http://hypothetical.com/service/containers\n\nGreat.\n\n&gt; This would return a list of container URIs. These URIs could then be\n&gt; used to &quot;Get the data in a container&quot;, like this:\n&gt;   UC2: GET  http://hypothetical.com/service/containers/1234\n\nGreat.\n\n&gt; This would return the data in the container. One of the data items would\n&gt; be a URI to &quot;Get the list of subcontainers in a container&quot;, like this:\n&gt;   UC3: GET http://hypothetical.com/service/containers/1234/subcontainers\n\nIs there any deep reason not to combine the information here with the\ninformation above?\n\n&gt; This would return a list of subcontainer URIs. These URIs could then be\n&gt; used to &quot;Get the data in a subcontainer&quot;, like this:\n&gt;   UC4: GET\n&gt; http://hypothetical.com/service/containers/1234/subcontainers/5678\n\nGreat. But I would suggest that this one would be just as good:\n\nhttp://hypothetical.com/service/containers/1234/5678\n\n5678 is logically a child of /1234, not of its &quot;subcontainer index.&quot; And\nit solves your verbosity problem.\n\n&gt; My concern is that this approach gets pretty verbose. Given that at each\n&gt; level there is only one class of sub-item, I have considered making the\n&gt; containers & subcontainers implicit. This results in a shorter set of\n&gt; URLs than the above four, like this:\n&gt;   UC1: GET http://hypothetical.com/service/\n&gt;   UC2: GET http://hypothetical.com/service/1234\n&gt;   UC3: GET http://hypothetical.com/service/1234/\n\nIt&#39;s only UC2 and UC3 that I dislike. Change UC3 to /1234/subcontainers\nand I think you are set. \n\n&gt;   UC4: GET http://hypothetical.com/service/1234/5678\n&gt; \n&gt; My concern is that the difference between the GETs for UC2 and UC3 seem\n&gt; so trivial to be incorrect/confusing/plain wrong.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d appreciate any suggestions, comments, required reading or references\n&gt; from the group. Thanks in advance.\n\nThink of &quot;subcontainers&quot; as &quot;index.html&quot;. It&#39;s just an index and doesn&#39;t\nneed to have children of its own. Or it could be merged with the &quot;other\ncontent&quot; for the resource so that one GET gives you everything.\n-- \nCome discuss XML and REST web services at:\n  Open Source Conference: July 22-26, 2002, conferences.oreillynet.com\n  Extreme Markup: Aug 4-9, 2002,  www.extrememarkup.com/extreme/\n\n"}}
