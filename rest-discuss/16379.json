But it&#39;s fundamental to REST that you\nsend Content-Type to allow intermediaries and user agents to identify\nthe processing model of the payload, where the response includes a\npayload.  This is not required by HTTP, but it is a REST constraint.\n\nOpaque media type identifiers do have an impact on intermediaries, many\ncaches only concern themselves with ubiquitous media types and ignore\neverything else as not accounting for enough traffic to warrant caching.\nNot that caching is the only action an intermediary can take.  If no\nintermediary has any clue about the processing model of a custom media\ntype, then all it can be is a router, not a participant -- regardless\nof what other headers are sent.  See REST 6.5.1.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d be interested to understand exactly what you believe the costs of\n&gt; such identifiers are to self-descriptiveness, and what types of\n&gt; layered/intermediary mechanism would be effected.\n&gt; \n\nNo, I&#39;m not going to rewrite Roy&#39;s thesis, which explains the benefits\nand tradeoffs of the uniform interface in depth:\n\n&quot;REST enables intermediate processing by constraining messages to be\nself-descriptive: interaction is stateless between requests, standard\nmethods and media types are used to indicate semantics and exchange\ninformation, and responses explicitly indicate cacheability.&quot;\n\nIntermediate processing is _not_ enabled _except_ through the use of\nstateless interactions consisting of standard methods and media types.\nThe entire notion of anarchic scalability depends upon self-descriptive\nmessaging, which by definition requires the use of standard media types,\nnot just cache-control headers.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; You can&#39;t look something up without a registry?  Pro-tip:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.google.com/search?q=%22application/hal%2Bxml%22\n&gt; \n\nFirst of all, please refer to RFC 4288.  Your syntax is that of the\nstandards tree, and will never be approved by IANA unless there&#39;s a\ncorresponding RFC.  You need to choose an appropriate tree, then take\nfive whole minutes out of your day to register your identifier.  Why is\nthis such an insurmountable obstacle, that using Google is preferable?\n\nYes, you can look anything up on Google, but Google isn&#39;t a registry,\nand a registry is required to avoid collisions where multiple parties\nare using the same identifier for wildly different purposes.  Google\ncan&#39;t keep anyone else from using your identifier for another purpose.\nThe IANA registry exists for exactly that reason.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; If crawlers were to provide a pagerank equivalent for media types,\n&gt; according to public usage, could we do away with the registry\n&gt; altogether? If not, why not?\n&gt; \n\nYou&#39;re free to suggest any new mechanism as a successor to the IANA\nregistry.  But, in the real world of today, if you&#39;re using HTTP, NO,\nyou can&#39;t do away with the IANA registry because it&#39;s an integral part\nof the protocol.  Such suggestions are only relevant to discussions of\nsuccessor protocols, like HTTP 2 or Waka.\n\nBut, I think that&#39;s a horrible idea, since it does nothing to avoid\ncollisions -- only allows a set-in-stone identifier&#39;s meaning to change\nover time according to the whims of the mob.  Such anarchy is not\nconducive to the goals of a uniform interface, and is certainly at odds\nwith the long-term stability that&#39;s a goal of REST.\n\nThe self-descriptive messaging constraint of REST _cannot_ be met in\nHTTP over the Internet, _unless_ the media type is IANA-registered.  BY\nDEFINITION.  No amount of arguing with me can change this reality...\nUnless of course there&#39;s something wrong with my grasp of plain English:\n\n&quot;REST enables intermediate processing by constraining messages to be\nself-descriptive... STANDARD MEDIA TYPES are used to indicate semantics\nand exchange information...&quot;\n\nSeriously, people, what part of that am I somehow getting wrong?  How\nelse can one identify what STANDARD MEDIA TYPE is used, except through\nthe IANA registry which correlates identifiers to media types, which is\nthe only mechanism HTTP defines to determine the media type from any\nidentifier sent over the Internet?\n\nOnce again, how this is at all controversial just befuddles me.  :-(\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
