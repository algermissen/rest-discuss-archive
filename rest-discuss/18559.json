Interface=\r\n versioning seems to be\n&gt; &gt; one popular use..   Other than recent RFC draft=\r\ns concerning the suggestion to\n&gt; &gt; no longer use the &quot;X-&quot; prefix, very litt=\r\nle else is written.\n&gt; \n&gt; &#39;Extended&#39; headers, as you put it, aren&#39;t actually=\r\n what you think. The &#39;X-&#39;\n&gt; prefix is meant for experimental headers, and t=\r\nhus are only meant to be used in\n&gt; private experiments. They&#39;re not somethi=\r\nng that&#39;s meant to be seen in the wild,\n&gt; but this convention unfortunately=\r\n gets abused a lot.\n&gt; \n&gt; In fact, there&#39;s even an I-D to deprecate the futu=\r\nre use of &#39;X-&#39;:\n&gt; http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-appsawg-xdash-03\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Clearly, one could get carried with Extended Headers, however they do =\r\nhave\n&gt; &gt; their uses.
