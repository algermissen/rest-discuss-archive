The goal of my thesis is the development of a graphical\nmodeling language for resource-oriented (aka RESTful) applications\nfollowing criteria defined by Daniel Moody [1].\nPart of this development is also the evaluation of the new language I\nhave developed regarding these criteria.\n\nI would therefore like to ask you for your support by taking the\nquestionnaire I have devised to do that evaluation. Filling out the\nquestionnaire will take about 20 minutes. It is available online under\nthe following URL:\nhttp://bit.ly/visualRest\n\nAs a small &quot;thank you&quot; for filling out the questionnaire, you also\nhave the chance to win one of three books afterwards (details can be\nfound under the aforementioned URL).\n\nThe questionnaire is online and ready to take input starting today\n(February 7th) and will be closed on February 20th.\n\nI would really appreciate your help and am looking forward to your\nanswers.\n\nThank you and best regards,\nOliver van Porten\n\n\n"}}
