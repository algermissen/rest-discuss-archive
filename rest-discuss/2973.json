If it is a request, then \n&gt; the pusher is a\n&gt; &#39;client&#39;. If it is a response, then you are doing \n&gt; request/response outside a\n&gt; single TCP/IP connection - which is fine but I haven&#39;t seen \n&gt; anybody do it\n&gt; yet (you&#39;ll need correlation ids in messages, etc).\n&gt; \n&gt; Push is a really bad term. Trust me.\n\nI do.\n\nImplicit Request and Persistent Request are better terms.  Implicit\nrequest means that as long as you&#39;re there and I&#39;m here and you have\nclass X of data, I want it.  Persistent Request means I want each\nand every piece of it, without having to ask for each and every\npiece.  Of course, you can elaborate on those themes.\n\nMost of my career I&#39;ve worked on &quot;push&quot; based market data systems.\nIt&#39;s an optimization of the more familiar client-server model in\nwhich requests are explicit.\n\nWalden\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
