It&#39;s been a while :-)\n\nThe compensating transaction model in the reference Bill sent round is  \nwhat you&#39;re looking for I think (cf atoms in BTP). This work began  \nlife in HP way back before we started working on BTP and there was  \ndefinitely some cross-pollination.\n\nMark.\n\n\nOn 2 Jun 2009, at 17:07, Bob Haugen wrote:\n\n&gt; I have not studied the proposal in depth yet, so I may comment more\n&gt; after I do so.\n&gt;\n&gt; But my immediate response is that I think another less-well-known\n&gt; transaction pattern is more appropriate for the Web in general and\n&gt; ReST in particular.\n&gt;\n&gt; That is variously called &quot;provisional-final&quot; or &quot;options&quot; (among  \n&gt; other names).\n&gt;\n&gt; It does not require locking, nor does it require compensating actions\n&gt; (which are either troublesome or impossible).\n&gt;\n&gt; The basics are:\n&gt; 1. In the first phase, all participants update their resources\n&gt; provisionally (whether by state or by separate provisional resource),\n&gt; 2. Upon commit, all participants update their resources in their final\n&gt; state (or create final resources).\n&gt; 3. Upon abort or cancel, all participants delete their provisional\n&gt; resources, or mark them cancelled, or create new cancelled resources.\n&gt;\n&gt; The pattern also allows selective commits or cancels, for example for\n&gt; a bidding process.\n&gt;\n&gt; It was implemented in OASIS BTP, which could also be made RESTful\n&gt; without a lot of work.\n&gt; http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=business-transaction\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
