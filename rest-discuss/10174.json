For that, I can find\na lot of interesting examples in the wild.  (Ignore the fact that\nhForms uses POST for now, think HTML 5 and PUT)\n\n* I can create a form that will update all the values associated with\nthe resource, but also a form to update some of these values, or offer\nboth alternatives for the same resource.  Is one better than the\nother?\n\n* I can allow the form to mark which part of the resource gets\nupdated, much the same way printed forms have an optional &#39;change of\naddress&#39; part with a checkbox.\n\n* I can pre-fill the form with existing values from the resource, and\njust write over the resource from all the request parameters.  But\nsometimes, I would chose not to process missing values; account\nsetting pages use that when updating passwords, but ignoring empty\npassword fields.\n\nWhich is acceptable and which would you frown upon?\n\n\n-- Assaf\nhttp://labnotes.org\n\n"}}
