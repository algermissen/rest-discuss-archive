Strictly speaking, I started\noff with &quot;local&quot; relational database technologies.  But over the years I\nhave broadened my conceptual view of databases to be any group of resources\nthat are retrievable by an identifier.  This could be a key value in a RDBMS\ntable or an HTTP URL on the web.  It&#39;s all the same to me...\n\nTo me there are four basic operations (verbs) that can occur against a\ndatabase:\n\nADD    (e.g. SQL INSERT)\nEDIT    (e.g. SQL UPDATE)\nDELETE (e.g. SQL DELETE)\nGET    (e.g. SQL SELECT)\n\nUntil working with REST, I had still conceptualized the above verbs as doing\nphysical things to the resources themselves.  The identifiers were\nsecond-hand citizens to the data, being nothing more than a convenient way\nto access a resource.  However, as I begin to understand REST more and more,\nI have started seeing these verbs in a different light.\n\nInstead of verbs that act on a resource, I see them as verbs that act on\nwhatever the identifier is mapped to (which we tend to conceptualize as a\nresource).  When I say ADD, what I would have been saying in the past (from\nmy rdbms pov):\n\n    Take this data and make a record/resource which is identifiable by it&#39;s\nkey.\n\nNow I would say:\n\n    Take the key and map the data to it.\n\nLikewise, EDIT would be the same:\n\n    Take the key and update the data that is mapped to it.\n\nDELETE would be:\n\n    Take the key and remove the mapping to the data.\n\nGET would be:\n\n    Take the key and return the data that is mapped to it.\n\n\nIn RDBMS, these are still perfectly valid statements, if not a bit &quot;oddly\nworded&quot;.  When I turn around and look at URIs and Resources (as discussed on\nthis list), it still makes perfect sense to use the above verbs.  The URI is\nthe key and the Resource is the data.\n\n\nIf you want to map them to HTTP verbs, you might end up with something like\nthe following:\n\nADD -&gt; POST\nEDIT -&gt; PUT\nDELETE -&gt; DELETE\nGET -&gt; GET\n\nOf course, these are not perfect matches.  As we know, POST can do more than\njust create a new URI&lt;-&gt;Resource mapping.  We also know that PUT do more\nthan just an EDIT.  At the same time, EDIT in RDBMS systems allows a partial\nedit, which PUT does not (put any arguments to this statement in a different\nthread, please). DELETE and GET are about the only things that actually work\nmore or less the same.\n\nSo does this mean that the ADD, EDIT, DELETE, GET model is wrong?  I don&#39;t\nthink so.  I think that the HTTP POST, PUT, DELETE, GET model is ambiguous\nand could be improved to adopt the other model.  This is where CREATE came\nin.  In this case, CREATE is identical to ADD.  So, suppose we had this\nmodel instead:\n\nADD -&gt; CREATE\nEDIT -&gt; PUT\nDELETE -&gt; DELETE\nGET -&gt; GET\n\nNow, we are a bit closer.  But this leaves out POST.  Sort of.  POST can be\nused for all sorts of things.  However, if we were to relax PUTs\ncourse-grained update requirements, POST would not have to be used for that.\nSince CREATE is dedicated to the creation of the URI&lt;-&gt;Resource mappings,\nPOST would not have to be used for that either.  In the end, POST becomes\nnothing more than a generic RPC mechanism.  Interestingly, some SQL servers\nactually have the same thing:  EXEC.  When you need to submit data to a\nserver and there is no visible side effect (i.e. none of the four other\nverbs are happening), that&#39;s when you use POST.\n\nSo, let&#39;s add one more verb to the mix:\n\nADD -&gt; CREATE\nEDIT -&gt; PUT\nDELETE -&gt; DELETE\nGET -&gt; GET\nEXEC -&gt; POST\n\nIn the end, I see this as a cleaner, less ambiguous set of verbs than the\ncurrent HTTP verbs.  I am sure you will disagree with me.  :)  But that&#39;s\nfine.  There are certainly questions that need answering such as how these\nnew (variations) verbs deal with &quot;safety&quot;, &quot;idempotency&quot;, caching, etc.  But\nI would be willing to tackle those issues if I knew that there were others\nthat saw this as I did (or at least were open to the possibility).  :)\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
