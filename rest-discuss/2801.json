Is there anything\n&gt; un-RESTful about constraining resources implicitly based on the\n&gt; user&#39;s authenticated identity?  It makes me uneasy, but I&#39;m not sure\n&gt; why.\n\nYou are varying the view based on something explicitly in the message \n*and* defined by HTTP. I think that&#39;s okay. It is not that different \nthan content-negotiation or language-negotiation.\n\n&gt; ... In that case, two different users\n&gt; accessing /Subscriptions via GET will see disjoint subsets of the\n&gt; resource.  By extension, an entire resource schema (application) may\n&gt; be implicitly constrained by the security properties of the access.\n&gt; \n&gt; What does REST have to say about this, if anything?\n\nIt is implicit in that there is no flag saying: &quot;This representation is \nspecific to you&quot; but it is triggered by something in the request message \nand in that sense it is explicit.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
