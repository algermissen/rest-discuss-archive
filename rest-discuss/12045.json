From the client&#39;s point of view,  \neven when it is an HTML forms-capable application, application/x-www- \nform-urlencoded encoding does not imply anything about optionality of  \nencoded parameters. Whether a partially filled form submit succeeds is  \napplication specific, and even us mortals can&#39;t deal with partial  \nforms correctly without explicit hints in the markup.\n\n&gt; I&#39;m not sold on sub-resource thing at all. I think if you want that,\n&gt; then use RDF, which has the sufficient conceptual weight to decompose\n&gt; data, and isn&#39;t muddied by syntax specifics.\n\nAlso curious about your comment on sub-resources. A sub-resource is a  \nresource on its own, and a PUT should be fine to update it. By way of  \nlinks, the server can decouple the client from having to assume that a  \nresource is part of another resource.\n\nSubbu\n\n"}}
