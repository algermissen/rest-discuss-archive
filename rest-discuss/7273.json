I&#39;m designing a URL scheme for resources in a\n&gt;  REST based architecture.\n&gt;\n&gt;  However, these resources can have different identifiers.  They have a\n&gt;  physical ID that is unique, a logical id which can identify bunch of versions\n&gt;  of a resource, and other id&#39;s like name.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Typically, you see RESTian urls of the form:\n&gt;\n&gt;  \thttp://mydomain.com/resource/id\n&gt;\n&gt;  which works well for the physical id situation.\n&gt;\n&gt;  But what if I want to get the resource with alternate id&#39;s?  Let&#39;s use the\n&gt;  logical id as an example.  Would this be reasonable:\n\nVersioning of a resource is a good example, where the latest\nversion of the resource is available at:\n\n   /resource/id/\n\nand historical versions of that resource are available at:\n\n   /resource/id/version\n\nNote that the URIs don&#39;t necessarily have to be hierarchical, nor\ndo they even have to be on the same server. We could have the following:\n\n  http://main.example.org/blog/id/\n  http://archive.example.com/blog/id/version\n\nNote that I changed resource to &#39;blog&#39; to make the discussion\nmore concrete. The URIs can be at different location because\nthey are all different resources,\n\n    http://main.example.org/blog/1/\n\nis the most recent version of the first post on this blog. While\n\n  http://archive.example.com/blog/1/3\n\nis the third revision of the first post on http://main.example.org/blog.\n\nPutting them on separate domains should make it readily clear\nthat any sort of PUTing or POSTing to archive.example.com\nreally has no business updating main.example.org. For the case\nof updating the resource you should PUT a new representation\nto\n\n   http://main.exaple.org/blog/1/\n\nwhich will create a new version resource:\n\n  http://archive.example.com/blog/1/{N+1}\n\nIf you want to do this and avoid the lost update problem\nthen use ETags:  http://www.w3.org/1999/04/Editing/\n\nIf you want to find the versioned resource from main.example.org\nthen return that in a Content-Location: header.\n\n   -joe\n\n-- \nJoe Gregorio        http://bitworking.org\n\n"}}
