In your case, OPTIONS will return just GET (from the \nfour you mentioned)\n\nIf a user-agent send a PUT, or POST, or DELETE to that URI the server \nwill respond with  405 Method Not Allowed.\nThat&#39;s it, the REST theorists will tell you that shouldn&#39;t happen \nbecause a REST application will have all those URI/Verbs being driven by \nHipertext, meaning you don&#39;t know in advance the URI and/or the Verbs \nbut you should only follow the links that the server send back to you.\n\nBut in fact, sometimes things work in practice and not in theory, so \nthere are situations where that can not happen, for example in the &quot;few \nwell know URI&#39;s that are the entry point of a application&quot;, but there \nare more...\n\nNow, to be REST and not HTTP, where I said URI you should read Resource, \nwhere I said &quot;links&quot; you should read &quot;hipertext embedded in the \nrepresentation of the resource that should drive the application state \nchanges&quot; and I&#39;m sure that the good theorists in here will have a way of \nadding at least &quot;Media-Type&quot; or &quot;content-negotiation&quot; and other valuable \nconcepts, but for me, that actually have to use these things in \npractice, I found much better to start from the bottom with simple \nthings and try to go up from there...\n\n\n\nOllie wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt; For some of the resources I&#39;m working with don&#39;t have a \n&gt; method&#92;operation that maps on to PUT, POST, DELETE if I&#39;m using HTTP \n&gt; as the transport.\n&gt;\n&gt; Should the end user of the service have some way to find out the\n&gt; operations supported by a reosurce or should I just return the\n&gt; appropriate status code?\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers\n&gt;\n&gt; Ollie\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &lt;mailto:rest-discuss%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Jan Algermissen \n&gt; &lt;algermissen1971@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ollie,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Sep 21, 2009, at 1:22 PM, Ollie wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Should I expose the operations a resources supports & If so how\n&gt; &gt; &gt; should I expose the operations?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What do you mean by &#39;operations&#39;?
