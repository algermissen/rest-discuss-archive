Following all REST-related dev=\r\nelopment on the WWW is somewhat a hassle since there&#39;s a lot to follow: thi=\r\ns discussion group, a lot of blogs covering both REST and non-REST stuff an=\r\nd a lot of other pages (projects, frameworks, news articles, scientific pap=\r\ners...) which are hard to search for since &quot;REST&quot; is not a very good query.=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; What I&#39;d like is a brief overview of only and all things REST that h=\r\nappened in the last week and to be able to receive that overview through my=\r\n feed reader. A blog feels right for delivery, but raises the question of w=\r\nho would maintain it and how. A collaborative approach where everyone would=\r\n send links to a single person which would compile the blog post would work=\r\n. An alternative would be creating a wiki page for collaborative link gathe=\r\nring, but leaves the question of how the overview would be delivered on a w=\r\neekly basis. Another alternative would be to use this group for both gather=\r\ning links (as replies to a single request-for-links weekly post) and publis=\r\nhing the weekly overview (as a new weekly post).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Anyway, what do you =\r\nthink?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;&gt; Ivan\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----------------------------------=\r\n--\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
