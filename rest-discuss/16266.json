I managed to tie my \nhead in a knot. Please untangle me.\n\nSuppose that I am trying to supply my clients with a RESTful way to send \nChristmas cards. I have access to a RESTful service that catalogs my friends. \nIt&#39;s at http://yourfriends.example.com . It gives me a way to GET a person \ndocument defined by a person.xsd XML schema by linking from a page that lists my \nfriends. This unfortunately doesn&#39;t have addresses, and I need my client to pick \none of the addresses on file to send the card to. Fortunately, I know of another \nRESTful web service that does supply addresses for a person. There&#39;s even a link \nto it in the person XML. The links point to address.xsd documents generally \nhosted by http://addresses-galore.example.com\n\nHere&#39;s some approaches (m namespace is mine, the two above are p and a \nrespectively):\n\n1) I create representation like that shown below in my own new schema \nperson-with-address.xsd\n  &lt;m:person-with-address&gt;\n    &lt;p:person ...&gt;...&lt;/p:person&gt;\n    &lt;m:addresses&gt;\n      &lt;a:address ...&gt;...&lt;/a:address&gt;\n      ...\n    &lt;/m:addresses&gt;\n  &lt;/m:person-with-address&gt;\n\n2) I notice that person.xsd is extensible and so I create my own compliant \nperson.xsd documents like so\n  &lt;p:person ...&gt;\n    ...\n    &lt;m:addresses&gt;\n      &lt;a:address ...&gt;...&lt;/a:address&gt;\n      ...\n    &lt;/m:addresses&gt;\n  &lt;/p:person&gt;\n\n3) Suppose I take approach #2 and yourfriends.example.com notices and decides to \nhost them. They wish to offer both representations (their original and my \nextension). Are these representations of the same or different resources? Is it \nreasonable for them to try to let users choose the thin or fat version of a \nperson using content negotiation? If so, how can you differentiate these by a \nmedia type?\n\nIs there any issue here in solution 1 or 2 because I&#39;m constructing an \napplication state as (a client of yourfriends and addresses-galore) that wasn&#39;t \nhypertext driven?\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
