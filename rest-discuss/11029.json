The server may parse the URI, but to clients it is\nnothing more than a slightly structured but opaque string. (The\nstructural aspect is that you can compose relative URIs. You do\nnot convey meaning in that way, however.)\n\n&gt; Format 2: http://localhost/MyResources/State?id=1\n&gt; chooses the state of &quot;MyResources&quot; and provides id=1 as input\n&gt; to this state.\n\nThis is what I meant by RPCish thinking. This is more like a\nfunction call, where the URI names the function and the query\nstring supplies the parameters. There is a resource in your app,\nbut it’s only selected by a private numeric identifier passed to\nvarious functions.\n\nIn contrast, in the other case, you should think of the entire\n“http://localhost/MyResources/1” as the identifier of the\nresource in question. It’s not just “the record with the primary\nkey 1 that you retrieve via “http://localhost/MyResources/”. In\nother words, the 2nd resource might just as well have the URI\n“http://example.com/res/two” with both of them belonging to the\nsame collection.\n\nIn practice that doesn’t happen much, but it might – as a small\nexample, LiveJournal and various 37Signals apps include the\nusername in the hostname.\n\nA practical benefit of thinking in this terms is that it makes it\neasier to use reverse proxy caches to route traffic based purely\non features of the URI space, so that you can at least partially\npush partitioning concerns out of your code and make it largely\na concern of deployment. Small pieces loosely coupled.\n\n&gt; So I would like to know if semantically if the query string\n&gt; formats make any difference to the client?\n\nNo, none.\n\nIn a properly REST-respecting situation, the client only follows\nlinks and submits forms without parsing URIs or constructing them\nbased on out-of-band information (such as some kind of service\ndocument).\n\nSo to the client it really doesn’t matter at all how the URIs\nlook.\n\nThe only pragmatic consideration you *might* have is that it’s\neasier to construct key-value query strings using HTML forms\nalone, whereas instructing the client about how to construct\nother parts of the URI at run time is reserved for programmatic\nclients or “Ajax.”\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
