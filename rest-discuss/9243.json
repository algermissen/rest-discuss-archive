For example, I&#39;m implementing a referral pr=\r\nogram where the user enters a \nlist of names and addresses into an HTML for=\r\nm and then picks from a list of rewards. After \neach step, I need to perfor=\r\nm server-side validation. Only after the second stage validation \noccurs ca=\r\nn the &quot;transaction&quot; be considered complete and committed. Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve =\r\n\nconsidered thus far:\n\nGET /referrals: gets an empty form in which users en=\r\nter referral names and emails\nPOST /referrals: submits the referral form da=\r\nta (names and emails) and returns a 201 \nLocation: /referrals/{id}, where {=\r\nid} is the server generated-id for this set of referrals or a 409 \nif the v=\r\nalidation failed, displaying the original name/email form with inline error=\r\n messages\nGET /referrals/{id}: based on the previous post, the server knows=\r\n that the referral names and \naddresses have been entered, so the user gets=\r\n a new form to select a reward (essentially \ncustomizing the representation=\r\n based on the state of the resource)\nPOST /referrals/{id}: submit _only_ th=\r\ne reward data to update the referral resource (e.g. \npartial PUT without th=\r\ne religious war).\n\nDoes this sound &quot;correct&quot; or at least reasonable? I woul=\r\nd greatly appreciate any alternatives \nor suggestions.\n\nJustin\n\n\n"}}
