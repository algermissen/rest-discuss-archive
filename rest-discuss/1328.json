As is, I think\nit weakens your argument.\n\nMost of the existing protocols on the Internet don&#39;t follow the OSI\nmodel either, so another protocol behaving in a non OSI way is no big\ndeal. Specifically if you look at RFC-871, it observes that the\nInternet design is not a rigid 7 layer stack, but a hierarchy where\nyou can do the sorts of protocol nesting that SOAP is doing. Without\nthat sort of nesting tunneling and gatewaying are impossible.\n\nFor that matter, the OSI official position on their 7-layer cake is\nthat it is supposed to be descriptive and not prescriptive, offering a\nlanguage to talk about protocols and not an absolute dictum as to\nprotocol design. If the OSI committees had realized this we&#39;d have\nbeen spared much hassle.\n\nhttp://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc871.html\nhttp://www.med.utah.edu/medinfo/horthner/webclass/sld018.htm\n\nHmmmm...thinking about it, this whole deal with SOAP and REST reminds\nme of the OSI/ARPANet wars of years gone by. They had a nice looking\nmodel with a gawd-awful committee process pushing it, we had a simple\nmodel and the no standardization without implementation policy.\n\n--john\n\n[B]eware of the panacea peddlers: just because you wind up naked\ndoesn&#39;t make you an emperor. -- Michael A Padlipsky\n\n--- In rest-discuss@y..., Paul Prescod &lt;paul@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \t== REST From a Protocols Point of View ==\n&gt; \n&gt; There is another way to come to the REST position without any\ninterest\n&gt; in Web architecture. One can look at SOAP purely as a protocol\nwithout\n&gt; even considering the problems it is supposed to solve. It bends or\n&gt; breaks all of the rules common among Internet protocols. For\ninstance,\n&gt; if one reads a book on the roles of networking protocols, it is\nclear\n&gt; that SOAP is a layer 6 (presentation layer) protocol but SOAP\nactually\n&gt; runs on top of HTTP and SMTP, which are both layer 7 protocols. That\n&gt; makes SOAP a layer 8 protocol. Unfortunately the standard network\nstack\n&gt; diagrams max out at 7! By definition the 7th layer, the application\n&gt; layer, is the top layer. SOAP treats layer 7 protocols as\n&quot;transport&quot;\n&gt; protocols. It pretends that they are layer 4 protocols. This causes\n&gt; various sorts of discomfort for system administrators, security\n&gt; analysts and protocol purists.\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
