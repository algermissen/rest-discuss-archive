Does such a thing even make sense?\n&gt; \n&gt; Let&#39;s say a URI represents a log for a chat session.\n&gt; PUT would overwrite the log and start again. POST \n&gt; would add some text to the bottom.\n\nHere is another example: one user POSTs a\nrepresentation of an empty container resource named\n&#39;b&#39; to the container resource at /a, then POSTs\nrepresentations of new resources named &#39;c&#39; and &#39;d&#39; to\n/a/b.\n  1. POST to /a representation of b\n  2. POST to /a/b representation of c\n  3. POST to /a/b representation of d\n\nAnother user might take care of the whole thing in one\nPUT request by sending a representation of a container\nresource named b, with its subordinates c and d\nalready POSTed to it, into the container resource at\n/a.\n  1. POST to b representation of c\n  2. POST to b representation of d\n  3. PUT to /a/b representation of b\n\nThis shows that POST and PUT can happen to the same\nURI.  The first user POSTed representations of c and d\nto /a/b.  Yet in the second case b was PUT to /a/b\nwith c and d already POSTed to it.  In both cases new\nresources will exist at /a/b, /a/b/c and /a/b/d.\n\nPhilip\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo! Mail Plus - Powerful. Affordable.
