Just like Gopher and HTTP,\nnot at all like FTP.\n\nThe essence of the REST style is that this decoupling must be based on\na network-defined value for that header.  Gopher messaging over IP is\nnot self-descriptive because it defines its own identifier syntax,\ninstead of using the agreed-upon standard for self-descriptive IP\nnetwork message tagging and bagging, the Internet Media Type (RFC 2048).\n\n(Yes, I realize this contradicts what I&#39;ve said before, Nathan&#39;s\nfeedback has made my position even more strict than it was.  Don&#39;t\nforget that to some extent, REST is an ex-post-facto explanation of the\ndecision to extend MIME beyond e-mail to begin with, by encapsulating\nthe rationale and benefits of this decision within a constraint.)\n\nIn order to meet REST&#39;s definition of what makes an interface uniform,\nthe media type must be a media type, where IP is concerned.  If the\nidentifier in Content-Type isn&#39;t registered, then it isn&#39;t an Internet\nMedia Type, by the definition of media type, therefore it&#39;s *just a\nstring*, even if it&#39;s a URI, regardless of its syntax.\n\nInternet Media Types are self-descriptive *because* they&#39;re Internet\nMedia Types, i.e. registered.  Strings are not Internet Media Types,\ntherefore they are not self-descriptive, therefore not standardized,\ntherefore not uniform, therefore library-based instead of network-\nbased, therefore not remotely the same style as REST.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
