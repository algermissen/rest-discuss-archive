This may=\r\n well improve in the future but right now it\n&gt; doesn&#39;t seem like a good opt=\r\nion from the practical, cost-benefit point\n&gt; of view (not the architectural=\r\nly pure one).\n\nA benefit of forms is that they can provide data to include =\r\nin the corresponding submission that needs not or must not (due to volatili=\r\nty) be remembered by the client.\n\nAn example would be the current price of =\r\nan item. Instead of constructing an order and including a remembered price,=\r\n the current price can be right in the form for the client to review and th=\r\nen put into the submission request.\n\nI was sort of against forms, but Ian S=\r\n. Robinson totally changed my mind on this about a year ago when pointing t=\r\nhe above out to me.\n\nJan\n"}}
