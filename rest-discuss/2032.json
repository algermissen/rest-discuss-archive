If what you want to accomplish\n    P&gt; is semantically equivalent to a PUT or DELETE then why not use\n    P&gt; the standardized method for doing it? \n\nCan I ask a really naiive question?  I&#39;ve thought about this, but I&#39;ve\nnever found any method to actually implement this; is there something\nI should know about browsers?\n\nFor example, on an academic website project, we needed to allow\nprofessors access to update their personal bio by adding, deleting and\namending descriptions of their papers.  Logically, we&#39;d want to use\nPOST, DELETE and GET/DELETE/PUT (?) to accomplish these operations,\nbut so far as I know browsers are only capabile of generating POST or\nGET requests.  We instead used the abomination of GET?action=delete\n\nHow do I code the HTML A:href to evoke a PUT or DELETE out of Mozilla\nand MSIE?  Even if the method is possible and simple, I think there is\nyour answer: I&#39;ve used web browsers and built websites for almost a\ndecade, and _I_ don&#39;t know, so I&#39;d hardly expect the average\n2yr-experienced webservices designer to know the distinction even\nexists.\n\n-- \nGary Lawrence Murphy &lt;garym@...&gt; TeleDynamics Communications Inc\nBusiness Innovations Through Open Source Systems: http://www.teledyn.com\n&quot;Computers are useless.
