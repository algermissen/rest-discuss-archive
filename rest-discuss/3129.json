So far, I just cannot see how this\n&gt;could be enforced.  Between the moment that the PUT was completed and a\n&gt;subsequent GET was requested, the resource could have been updated (via\n&gt;PUTs, if you want) several times.  There is no mechanism in HTTP to perform\n&gt;a PUT-followed-by-GET as an atomic operation.  As a result, it seems that\n&gt;one should *ever* expect the representation sent with a PUT to be the same\n&gt;as the representation retrieved with a GET, at least as a general rule.\n&gt;\nI&#39;m not sure I understand the previous sentence.  Is that *ever* or \n*never*.  I&#39;ll assume you meant *never*.\n\nI believe you&#39;re leaving out important parts of the statement.  I&#39;ll try \nto restate it here as I understand it:\n\nA GET operation that immediately follows a PUT operation must return \nexactly the representation presented by the PUT, _provided that the \nresource&#39;s state does not change between those two operations_.  Note \nthat this statement is about the behavior of the server; it is not about \nbehavior that an arbitraty client might be able to observe.\n\nI&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;ve had this discussion here before (or maybe it was \nrest-expolore), but I can&#39;t suffer through Yahoo&#39;s UI to provide a \nreference.  (Try searching the August/September 2002 archives)\n\nIf I remember correctly, this whole thing is not really about what you \nGET after a PUT.  It is more about whether or not you can do content \nnegotiation/have variants on a PUT.  As I understand it, Fielding says \nyou can&#39;t because there&#39;s no mechanism (in HTTP) to indicate whether the \ncontents of the PUT is a variant of the current representation or a \nreplacement for the current representation.  I seem to remember that the \nconversation wrapped up with an understanding that, in general, \nresources that support PUT cannot support content negotiation.\n\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n\n"}}
