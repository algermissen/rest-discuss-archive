Even the GData examples you cited do indeed have very \n&gt; specific representations wrapped inside a generic media types. That does \n&gt; not make those architecture any more generic than, say, an application \n&gt; using &quot;foo/bar&quot; media type.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hmmm. I think you&#39;re making my point. Indeed, putting a one-off \n&gt; representation inside a generic media type is &quot;stepping off the \n&gt; generality cliff&quot;. But adding a few extension elements to a fairly \n&gt; general purpose media type like SensorML is taking gentle step down the \n&gt; generality slope.\n\nIt&#39;s a difference in degree only. XML Namespaces tend mess with web \narchitecture&#39;s reliance on the media type as a statement for the \nrepresentation. RDF/OWL over XML has the same problem at a different level.\n\n\n&gt;  &gt; I am really confused by this. By adding a &quot;fifth constraint&quot; I \n&gt; thought this report is agreeing with the other four constraints, and \n&gt; hence that HTTP is an application protocol. Not so? How does WOA treat \n&gt; HTTP? As an application protocol or as a transport protocol?\n&gt; \n&gt; WOA treats HTTP as an application protocol. What&#39;s wrong with &quot;nested&quot; \n&gt; application protocols? APP is an application protocol &quot;nested&quot; in HTTP. \n&gt; And GData is nested in APP. Or how would you put it?\n\nAtomPub constrains REST and is manifested via HTTP. It doesn&#39;t nest \ninside HTTP. Aside from the usual transport/transfer objections to \nprotocol tunneling, actual physical nesting incurs other problems. For \nexample you introduce security attack vectors, eg one can nest HTTP \ninside HTTP for the purposes of achieving a batch protocol, but it \nrequires the consuming code be able to safely parse HTTP instead of \nleaving that to server infrastructure.\n\n&gt;  &gt; Could you give an example please? How would you build an app that \n&gt; does not fall of this cliff.\n&gt; \n&gt; Suppose I was going to use APP for a contact management protocol. \n&gt; Contrast putting my own one-off, not well thought through, idiosyncratic \n&gt; schema for contact information as the payload of an APP entity (stepping \n&gt; off a cliff) vs. using the hCard microformat as the basis for contact \n&gt; information inside the APP entity (stepping down the slope).\n\nhCard is a bad example to make the argument, as arguably it is a one-off \nnot well thought through idiosyncratic schema for contact information by \nvirtue of being difficult to parse if you&#39;re don&#39;t have a web browser to \nhand (I&#39;ve yet to meet a server developer that wants to consume a \nmicroformat).\n\nBill\n\n"}}
