To put this in\ncontext, I am starting up on a small project (written in PHP), the core of\nwhich will be a sort of content management system.  Documents will be\npublicly viewable, but additional features will require people to log in and\nhave an active &quot;session&quot;.\n\nSo, Here&#39;s the general layout of the paths I am going to use:\n\n/doc.php/docID\n\n&quot;docID&quot; will be a unique value that identifies a given document.  The\nreturned document (html only for now) will contain the following links:\n\n/doc.php/docID/discussions\n/doc.php/docID/references\n/doc.php/docID/revisions\n/doc.php/docID/subdocuments\n\nEach of those will contain additional links, etc.  I am comfortable with\nthis and it seems quite clean and simple to maintain.  However, these URLs\ncan be accessed in one of two modes.  A given viewer can have GET access or\ncan have POST access.  GET access basically allows a viewer to follow links.\nHowever, there are several features where the view can choose to be\ninteractive (e.g. create references, post discussion messages, etc.).  When\nthis is the case, the viewer must be authenticated.\n\nMy current design requires a viewer to log in and create a session in order\nto provide the necessary authentication.  Traditionally, I would have\ncreated a session ID and passed it around in the query string of every URL\non a page.  However, as I get more an more into REST, I am beginning to\nwonder if this is the right way of going about it.\n\nThere has been discussion as to whether\n\n/doc.php/docID\n\nand\n\n/doc.php/docID?sid=12345\n\nare equivalent URLs.  My take on them (now) is that they are actually two\ndifferent URLs that happen to return representations of the same resource.\n\nHowever, the second URL contains a series of characters (the entire query\nstring in this case) that has nothing to do with the resource itself.\nTherefore, it seems to me that it is not appropriate to use this URL to\npoint to the same resource as the first URL does, especially since in many\nof the cases the same exact representation will be returned to the viewer.\n\nI also do not want to use cookies to store the session ID for many reasons.\nSo what do I do?  How do I provide a common authentication mechanism that&#39;s\nsupported by most browsers and still keeps the URLs simple can clean (and\ntherefore more RESTful, I think)?\n\nOr am I totally misunderstanding the REST issues for tracking sessions?\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n\n"}}
