Thus the GET is idempotent as it\nalways refers to the next number in the sequence, and the design you\nmentioned is fine.\n\nYou do of course have an un-cachable resource representation since the\ncontents of the representation change with every request, but the\nresource itself always remains the same, the value of the next number in\nthe sequence.\n\nPaul.\n\nEric Busboom wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m working on a REST interface for a system that doles out unique\n&gt; identifiers. For each request, the caller gives the system a\n&gt; namespace tag, and the system gives back the next number for that\n&gt; namespace.\n&gt;\n&gt; So,\n&gt;\n&gt; --&gt; GET /numbers/FOO/next\n&gt; 1 &lt;--\n&gt;\n&gt; --&gt; GET /numbers/FOO/next\n&gt; 2 &lt;--\n&gt;\n&gt; --&gt; GET /numbers/BAR/next\n&gt; 1 &lt;--\n&gt;\n&gt; That seems really wrong -- GET should be idempotent, and these\n&gt; requests clearly are not. But, I&#39;m also clearly getting, fetching, a\n&gt; value.\n&gt;\n&gt; How would you implement this interface?\n&gt;\n&gt; A similar question to this was asked regarding throwing Dice:\n&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/7768 \n&gt; &lt;http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/7768&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The dice discussion wandered a bit, but the most substantive\n&gt; suggestion seemed to be:\n&gt; Use GET\n&gt; Return a 302 status and a Location: header, representing the\n&gt; numerical result as a URL\n&gt; Include the numerical result in the body of the response\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there any consensus on this model? I&#39;m still concerned about the\n&gt; use of GET, and the use of the Location: header seems superfluous.\n&gt;\n&gt; eric.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n\n"}}
