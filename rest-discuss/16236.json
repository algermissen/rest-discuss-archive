What matters is that your\n&gt; hypertext provides a self-documenting API.\n&gt; \n\nIn fact, a user agent doesn&#39;t even need to understand your custom media\ntype.  My demo uses HTML to drive Atom interactions.  When I post the\nXforms interface, you&#39;ll see it comes down to filling out &quot;Atom forms&quot;\nto submit or edit entries.  The fact that browsers understand Atom is\nbeside the point -- user agents don&#39;t need an understanding of Atom to\nbe able to generate or pass around Atom documents -- as it isn&#39;t used.\n\nWhat matters is that Xforms instructs the user agent how to create XML\nand submit it to some URI as whatever *+xml media type it needs to be.\nXSLT transforms Atom into Xforms for display and editing.  The fact that\nthe system is Atom-based is not relevant to user agents following the\nhypertext API layered over it.  What user agents need to understand are\nthe non-Atom media types used to create the hypertext API.\n\nThere&#39;s no way to point user agents to that Atom-based system and say,\n&quot;the API is Atom Protocol.&quot;  Making that assumption doesn&#39;t make for a\nREST system.  In REST, hypertext appropriate to driving interactivity\nis used to describe Atom Protocol interfaces.  This holds true for any\nmedia type that&#39;s targeted for manipulation, using any protocol.\n\nProvided there&#39;s a hypertext API based on ubiquitous media types, the\nubiquity of the media type(s) targeted for manipulation becomes less\n(but certainly not un-) important.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
