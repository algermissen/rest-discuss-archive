However I don&#39;t buy the metadata argument. What at&#39;s the end of \n&gt; the URI is a resource, not a file. Resources are known only be their \n&gt; representations. If those representations are stored in a file system, \n&gt; fine; but they may be stored other ways.\n\nTo me, resources are abstractions/concepts that can be referenced using\nan identifier. They can&#39;t be reduced to a representation.\n\n&gt; The client operating through PUT or DELETE or MOVE has no reason to know \n&gt; or care about any metadata that never appears in the representation. If \n&gt; the metadata is somehow visible then it needs to be encoded in the \n&gt; method body or HTTP headers that the client PUTs to the server. \n&gt; Otherwise it&#39;s irrelevant like any other form of server state.\n\nIf you think about how the same resource can expose different\nrepresentations based on client preferences (via content negotiation),\nyou can conclude that a MOVE operation is superior to GET+PUT+DELETE.\n\n-- \nJerome Louvel\nhttp://www.restlet.org\n\n"}}
