Which is\nwhere RDFa comes in.\n\nAnd I cannot disagree with you. Yes, HTML + RDFa + POST \n&lt;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&gt; can solve just about anything you throw \nat it.\n\n&gt; REST is not about distributed objects, it&#39;s about distributed object\ninterfaces. Domain-specific vocabulary isn&#39;t exposed at the protocol\nlayer, it&#39;s embedded within generic-media-type representations.\n\nSo application/xml could be just as good as text/html since it doesn&#39;t \nexpose the domain vocabulary at the protocol layer? Let me answer that \nquestion myself: yes, but there is something missing - in HTML you get \nhypermedia semantics (links, forms) for free whereas in XML you have to \nreinvent it for every vocabulary.\n\nSo the dilema is: By leveraging HTML you get full hypermedia semantics but \nhave to embed domain data in it using tricks like RDFa. On the other hand, \nby using plain XML you have a straight forward way to encode domain data but \nhave no predefined hypermedia semantics. Right?\n\n/J�rn\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: Eric J.

But I don&#39;t see\n&gt; why using AtomPub makes any change? I still have to POST a domain\n&gt; specific media type &lt;order&gt;? So having a generic media type like\n&gt; AtomPub doesn&#39;t remove the need for domain specific stuff?\n&gt;\n\nREST is not about distributed objects, it&#39;s about distributed object\ninterfaces. Domain-specific vocabulary isn&#39;t exposed at the protocol\nlayer, it&#39;s embedded within generic-media-type representations.\n\nThink of anything you&#39;ve ever ordered online. The interface is HTML,\nnot some domain-specific media type. Yet somehow this works. What\nyou POST is really just some name-value pairs. HTML has loads of\nsemantics for expressing name-value pairs.\n\nWhat HTML lacks is a way of expressing the meaning of a name. Which is\nwhere RDFa comes in. The GoodRelations ontology allows decoupled\nclients to determine that a name refers to a part #, and another name\nrefers to the unit price, allowing an agent to comparison-shop between\nmultiple services whose markup varies widely.\n\n-Eric\n\n \n\n\n"}}
