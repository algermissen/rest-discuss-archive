Or will\n&gt; they continue, and start reinventing http-caching.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any thoughts ?\n\nWhen there was buzz around P2P, and Groove was the first mover, I really\nthought Groove would be the &quot;Netscape&quot; of the P2P wave.  After downloading\nand attempting to use it, I found that it was worth the space it took on my\nhard disk, so I removed it.  My sense was that it was more hype than\nanything.\n\nRegarding Groove Web Services, my thought is that their interface may in\nfact be very RESTful, but the sentence you quote above leads me to believe\nthat nothing has changed - more hype than anything.  A REST developer who\n*really* got it would call them like they are: GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE.\nAnd that same developer would know that SOAP was irrelevant.\n\nPhilip\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nThis e-mail may contain confidential and/or privileged information.
