It&#39;s not the number of people writing \n&gt; clients, but the number of different people who will have to \n&gt; change them in the future.  And most scaling bandwidth is \n&gt; easier than scaling development.\n\nI actually agree with that quite strongly.  \n\nHowever, and I explain this so you&#39;ll know why I make some of my arguments,\nI&#39;m also concerned with empowering a class of people that I think most who\nparticipate on these lists are not concerned with. I&#39;ll call those people\n&quot;occupational&quot; programmers (as opposed to &quot;professional&quot;) programmers.\nOccupational programmers by nature program to get a job done not because\ntheir job is programming. The more difficult something is the less likely an\noccupational programmers will ever be able to do it because they don&#39;t\nrarely have the time to learn more than beginner-level programming skills.\n\nI see REST-based services as being incredibly empowering for occupational\nprogrammers, but only if they are accessible at their skill level. If there\nis a requirement for REST-based services to do something that is beyond the\ncurrent skill set of an occupational programmer there is (IMO) an order of\nmagnitude less chance they will ever use it.  The unfortunate reality is\nthat the HATEOAS requirement puts a skill burden on occupational\nprogrammers, especially given the lack of standard ways to deal with HATEOAS\nand that fact that the &quot;universal web tool&quot; (i.e. the browser) doesn&#39;t\nsupport interacting with web services that don&#39;t (X)HTML content types. The\nbrowser is to HTTP and HTML what the Python command line is to Python code\nin that it is software that lets someone try something and see what they\nget.  That is essential for occupational programmer to learn as they don&#39;t\nhave time to learn by concept.  A web service with a published URL format\nwhere the occupational programmer can compose the URL and use the browser to\na discovery tool is critical for wide-scale use by occupational programmers.\nWhy do you think so many companies like Google publish direct URL interfaces\nfor their services?\n\nIMO for the HATEOAS to be fully respected and generally used we need a\nstandard way to discover and interact with REST-based web services and that\nstandard way to interact need to then be built into browsers thus allowing\npeople to discover and interact with them without having to write code.\nUntil that happens, it&#39;s unrealistic to expect widespread use of HATEOAS for\nany but the most standards-pedantic of web service publishers much like\npeople still use &lt;table&gt; elements instead of pure CSS because pure CSS\ndoesn&#39;t fully meet the needs of users.  Companies that have a strategic\nreason for more people to use their externally published web services are\nfoolish not to publish direct URL interfaces because given the current state\nof things HATEOAS signifcantly stunts adoption.\n\nBTW, 99% of what I&#39;m discussing in this email are web services published for\nexternal use, not web services that are only used by others in the same\norganization. \n\nThere are also cases where a HATEOAS requirement effectively nullifies the\nbenefit fo the service, for example the published URL interfaces for\nGoogle&#39;s Chart API [1].  Given that the Google Chart API returns an image\nfor use in a &lt;img src=&quot;...&quot;&gt; element, requiring the client to first call a\nmain URL to get the specific URL before it can use it elimates potential use\nanywhere Javascript is not an option and for anyone who does not have the\nrequired Javascript skills (My guess is more than 10 times more people know\nHTML than Javascript.)  Again, I&#39;m advocating for accessibility for the\nlesser skilled. They, after all, are not here to advocate for themselves\n(unless you count me in that category. :-)\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org \n\n[1] http://code.google.com/apis/chart/#url_format\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Assaf\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; But even your service is public, if it is important that the URL be \n&gt; &gt; able to change then make that clear in no uncertain terms \n&gt; in the docs \n&gt; &gt; and in UPPERCASE comments in any representations returned.  \n&gt; And if you \n&gt; &gt; are paranoid, literally change the URL every time with a \n&gt; validatation \n&gt; &gt; parameter so that anyone who did hard code quickly learns \n&gt; better and \n&gt; &gt; no time is given to allow hardcoded clients time is build up.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Or IMO best of all, just document it and commit to the URL \n&gt; format just \n&gt; &gt; as Google have done with their Chart service, for example. \n&gt; Yes I know, \n&gt; &gt; that violates the HATEOAS requirement but I personally don&#39;t think \n&gt; &gt; being a fundamentalist in all things is such a good idea; \n&gt; some times \n&gt; &gt; it is better just to put a stake in the ground. If \n&gt; *everything* were \n&gt; &gt; meta, we&#39;d never get anything done.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; -Mike Schinkel\n&gt; &gt; http://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\n&gt; &gt; http://www.welldesignedurls.org\n&gt; &gt; http://atlanta-web.org\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; -- Assaf\n&gt; \n&gt; http://labnotes.org\n\n\n"}}
