WebDAV had a problem to solve, and it solved it\npretty darn well ... modulo &quot;dav:&quot;, and PROPFIND.\n\nI&#39;m just saying that we could use some HTTP and WebDAV like features\nthat didn&#39;t have the builtin resource=representation assumption in them.\nThat doesn&#39;t mean that having tools that do make that assumption is\nbad, though when we have the new tools it might be nice to recast the\nold stuff in those terms.  For example, when we figure out the details\nof the &quot;SET&quot; method, we can define an extension such that it can be used\nfor doing operations semantically equivalent to PUT.\n\n&gt; HTTP 1.1 has\n&gt; this view simply because it has this method. In a world where resources\n&gt; are synonymous with documents (or files or records or any entity in\n&gt; computer accessible storage), DELETE makes sense. In a world where\n&gt; resources can reside outside computers and their storage, DELETE doesn&#39;t\n&gt; make much sense, at least not until Stephen King writes a story called\n&gt; Web Browser of the Gods.\n\nYou can ask to DELETE a person if you want.  The issue is, are you\nallowed?  I suggest that 403 is the best response to such a request,\nrather than 501.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
