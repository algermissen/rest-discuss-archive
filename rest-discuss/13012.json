If the media type  \nspec prefers to define that a PUT &lt;empty/&gt; does th=\r\ne flush, then that  \nis equally fine.\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; 2009/6/26 Ant=F3nio Mo=\r\nta &lt;amsmota@...&gt;\n&gt; Well, what I was saying is that the spec says &quot;to =\r\ndelete the  \n&gt; resource *or move it to an inaccessible location* &quot;, so the =\r\nresource  \n&gt; is not necessarily deleted. Now I think a URI doesn&#39;t exist &quot;p=\r\ner  \n&gt; se&quot; (or existing &quot;per se&quot; it points to nowhere, identifies nothing, =\r\n \n&gt; for me is the same as &quot;don&#39;t exist&quot; in the sense it doesn&#39;t have a  \n&gt; =\r\nrepresentation) so when I said &quot;delete the URI&quot; I should have said  \n&gt; &quot;dis=\r\nassociate the URI from the resource&quot; to be accurate.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ebenezer Ikonne wr=\r\note:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I did not miss that.  I&#39;m just saying that I don&#39;t believe a DEL=\r\nETE  \n&gt; &quot;deletes&quot; a URI as one could infer from your original statement.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; 2009/6/26 Ant=F3nio Mota &lt;amsmota@... &lt;mailto:amsmota@...&gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve been following all the thread, but the\n&gt;  =\r\n  question here was using\n&gt;    a DELETE  in a way that a subsequent GET wou=\r\nld return a 200.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    Ebenezer Ikonne wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;        &gt; I&#39;m not t=\r\nrying to argue in favour of one interpretation or\n&gt;        the other,\n&gt;    =\r\n    &gt; but for me feels &quot;strange&quot; a DELETE that deletes the\n&gt;        resourc=\r\ne and not\n&gt;        &gt; it&#39;s URI. What is worth a URI without representation? =\r\nWhat\n&gt;        does it\n&gt;        &gt; identifies?\n&gt;\n&gt;        It may feel &quot;strang=\r\ne&quot; like pineapple slices as a pizza topping\n&gt;        does to me, but it&#39;s n=\r\not wrong.\n&gt;\n&gt;        The URI is the &quot;pointer&quot; to the resource, not the reso=\r\nurce\n&gt;        itself. Issuing a DELETE should remove the resource\n&gt;        =\r\n(technically not the URI) and a GET to the resource using that\n&gt;        URI=\r\n should return a 404 (although I could see a use case for  \n&gt; 410).\n&gt;\n&gt;    =\r\n    Having said all this, I wouldn&#39;t use DELETE.\n&gt;\n&gt;        Eb\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
