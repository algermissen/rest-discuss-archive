Apache) is capable of\ndoing most of them.\n\nIn short, when SSS is used to handle dynamic contents, with all\nrequests redirected to a single index.php, here&#39;s a list of issues we\nmight need to deal with:\n\n1. Handle HEAD request\n- find a way to collect the resource info (last modified, data-size\netc) and send back a HTTP header response.\n\n2. Handle static resource (image files, css files) request\n- when everything is redirected into single file Index.php, static\nfiles cannot be reached.\n- must make sure the scripts able to fetch static files.\n\n3. Caching capability\n- since it is dynamic contents, web server can&#39;t help much now.\n- the scripts should able to deal with caching tags (ex. If-modified,\nExpires etc) in HTTP headers.\n\n4. Content Negotiation\n- scripts need to understand how Content Negotiation works in details,\naccording HTTP/1.1 spec, able to analyze &quot;Accept&quot; tag in request\nheaders and deal with it.\n\n\nIs there a possible way to &quot;reuse&quot; the functions in web server to deal\nwith such issues? or is there any available library codes in SSS (ex.\nphp)? or any comments and suggestions to deal with such issues?\n\n-Toydi-\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
