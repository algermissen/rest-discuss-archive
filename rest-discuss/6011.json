The  \n&gt; user interaction is that you want to show the user a page of items,  \n&gt; and on the right hand side show them what&#39;s in their cart, and allow  \n&gt; them to add items to the cart. If you say that page is the shopping  \n&gt; cart, then you can just post back to the same page and it will change  \n&gt; each time, which breaks the back button. I can&#39;t back up to go back  \n&gt; in time to previous versions of the shopping cart.\n&gt;   \nYou have a different idea of what &quot;breaks the back button&quot; means than I \ndo.  Since each URI represents a resource, the back button means &quot;go \nback to the previously viewed resource&quot;.  It does not mean &quot;undo what I \njust did&quot;.  If that previously viewed resource has changed, then when I \nhit the back button, I should see the changed resource.\n\nThus it is perfectly reasonable to use a single URI to represent a \nshopping cart.  Suppose I go through the following views:  Item A detail \n--(purchase item A)--&gt; shopping cart --(shop more)--&gt; main shopping page \n--(search for item B)--&gt; item B detail --(purchase item B)--&gt; shopping \ncart.  The shopping cart will show two items: A and B.  Then if I hit \nthe back button 3 times, I should be back at the shopping cart, which \nwould again show items A and B.  (When I navigate there, the browser \nwill contact the server with an If-Modified-Since header, so it will \nknow the cart has been updated, and it has to retrieve the resource.)\n\nYour suggestion of representing each state of the shopping cart as a \nseparate resource is not unRESTful.  Some people might even like it.  \nBut it is not the only way to do things.  And it does require more \nstorage/sophistication on the part of the server.  In your model, the \nback button still means &quot;go back to the previously viewed resource&quot;, but \nyour resource is now a single state of my resource.\n\nConceptually, I think most people think of a shopping cart, rather than \nthe state of a shopping cart, as a resource.  So, I think my (and Bill \nde la H&#39;s) method is more intuitive.\n\n-- \nLyle Kopnicky\nSoftware Project Engineer\nVeicon Technology, Inc.\n\n\n"}}
