It&#39;s an important principle of web \narchitecture that URIs are opaque. Using &quot;opaque&quot; differently doesn&#39;t \nchange that.\n\n&gt; but your first example most \n&gt; certainly has the potential to be what I would consider transparent or \n&gt; &quot;hackable&quot;\n\nOften a plus, but a plus irrelevant to REST.\n\nA minus if you abuse the advantages in ways that lead to brittleness.\n\n&gt; (as opposed to opaque).\n\nNo, as well as opaque to most processes.\n\n&gt; If &quot;ohiuwftojiics09fsdao&quot; \n&gt; is, say, a globally unique ID referencing a resource then I can \n&gt; (assuming the server says I can) take a analagous ID from another object \n&gt; and put it into the same place in a URI so that a GET will return me the \n&gt; object I&#39;m asking for.\n\nWhether ohiuwftojiics09fsdao is a globally unique ID or not, \nhttp://example.net/ohiuwftojiics09fsdao is a globally unique ID, as is \nhttp://example.net/main_api/users/user23, so why bother?\n\n&gt; I suppose I define transparency to be the degree to which the location \n&gt; of  one resource can be inferred from the location of a another \n&gt; resource.  The robustness of this over time is completely determined by \n&gt; the server implementation.\n\nNo it&#39;s not.\n\nThe robustness over time is determined by the fact that if one uses \nHATEOS then it doesn&#39;t matter which URIs are used. Structured URIs can \naid this by allowing for relative links and by making spot-hacks by \nhumans easier, but these are conveniences.\n\nBuilding on assumptions about structure will always be less robust than \nnot doing so, no matter how good or bad those assumptions are and \nwhether the winds of fate blow with you or against. Its continuing to \nwork is a matter of luck.\n\nAnd those assumptions would be present or absent in the client, not the \nserver.\n\n&gt; My original reply was simply making \n&gt; the point that there are certain types of applications where hypermedia \n&gt; can not be the sole driver of state, so URI transparency may be a good \n&gt; second-tier alternative.\n\nThey aren&#39;t RESTful.\n\nThey may be useful, they may be great in many ways, and when I control \nthe client and the server I often build them, but they aren&#39;t RESTful.\n\n\n"}}
