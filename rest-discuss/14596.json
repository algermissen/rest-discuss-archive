We keep talking about reach, but \n&gt; most (if\n&gt;  &gt; not all?) media types were designed for a specific client.\n&gt; \n&gt; Or clients. Atom has reach because lots of systems out there already \n&gt; understand how to process it.\n&gt; \n&gt; application/vnd.restbucks+xml does not have reach because there aren&#39;t \n&gt; many systems out there that understand it. Nor are there lots of \n&gt; libraries to choose from on lots of platforms that implement the \n&gt; processing model for that type. But it does have the advantage that it \n&gt; works really well for coffee ordering within the Restbucks domain.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
