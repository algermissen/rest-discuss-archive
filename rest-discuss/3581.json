However, most webdav\n&gt;&gt; implementers believed that a collection should exist prior to\n&gt;&gt; a PUT within it, since that makes it easier to catch user mistakes\n&gt;&gt; such as mistyping a long URI.  Hence, MKCOL.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; REST will happily accept either alternative, providing that the\n&gt;&gt; method is standardized (has the same meaning) for all resources\n&gt;&gt; (even if some may not allow it).\n&gt;\n&gt; But does HTTP happily accept either alternative?  Or does HTTP\n&gt; standarize on one or the other method?\n\nHTTP doesn&#39;t tell applications how to do a sequence of actions.\nIt only defines what each action means and how the client should\ninterpret the response to each action.  WebDAV is a little more\nexplicit about sequences, which is why it prefers MKCOL and would\nprobably reject a deep PUT.\n\n&gt;&gt; If you delete the container, it may have adverse effects on other\n&gt;&gt; links.  For example, if the server automatically maintains links,\n&gt;&gt; then you should not delete the container unless you want all of\n&gt;&gt; those links to go away.  So, delete each resource individually.\n&gt;\n&gt; What do you mean by &quot;the server automatically maintains links?&quot;\n\nMany content management products (like Day Software&#39;s Communique)\ninclude an automatic link maintenance function that will recognize\na delete on a resource and either note all links to it as being\nbroken (and thus scheduled for review) or simply deactivate those\nlinks so that they don&#39;t show up on the published pages until someone\neither changes the destination or restores the deleted resource.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
