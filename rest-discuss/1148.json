I think it&#39;s hard for us to be prescriptive about\nthis. An XSLT processor designed solely for use on TV set-top-boxes might\nhave no market requirement (or technical possibility) to write output to an\nHTTP PUT destination, nor indeed to anywhere other than the TV screen. We\nwant language interoperability, but we can&#39;t assume that all processors\nexecute in the same kind of environment.\n\nI don&#39;t mind, however, putting in some kind of note giving examples of the\nsorts of URI that permit writing.\n\nMichael Kay\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Mark Nottingham [mailto:mnot@...]\n&gt; Sent: 29 April 2002 21:36\n&gt; To: xsl-editors@...\n&gt; Cc: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: XSLT2.0 and HTTP-PUT\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; XSLT2 allows you to specify a URI to write output  documents \n&gt; to [1].
