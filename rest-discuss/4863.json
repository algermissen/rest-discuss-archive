Paraphrased from [1]\n&gt; \n&gt; PUT is used to update existing resources or to \n&gt; create a new resource if the URI given doesn&#39;t \n&gt; exist. Paraphrased from [2]\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The first thing you should do, though, is ask\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yourself *why* aren&#39;t you passing back the\n&gt; complete\n&gt; &gt; &gt; representation of a resource.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I was thinking of only passing the modified\n&gt; attributes\n&gt; &gt; of the resource back although I see what you mean.\n&gt; If\n&gt; &gt; I am to pass the complete representation then\n&gt; would I\n&gt; &gt; do it through a post to the resource\n&gt; \n&gt; Passing back a complete representation though a PUT\n&gt; would\n&gt; be better, given the definition of PUT[2].\n&gt; \n\nthanks Joe, I meant to say PUT.
