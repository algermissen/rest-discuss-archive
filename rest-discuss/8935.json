For  \ninstance, if client1 has a crappy UUID generator (I consider anything  \nexcept v4 with a proper pseudo-random generator to be crappy), then  \nclient2 can predict what will reasonably be the next identifier for  \nclient1 and form some kind of attack - depending on the weakness of  \nthe security model of your REST system and your clients.\n\n[1]  or GUIDs.. what is really the difference? Isn&#39;t universally  \nunique better than globally? :) Think about your fellow Martians!\n\nOf course it should be OK to set some kind of restriction on that  \nkind of UUIDs one excepts (easy to fake, but more difficult than just  \nusing a proper uuid library).\n\n\n\nOn 11 Jun 2007, at 14:31, eoinprout wrote:\n&gt; But if you feel that strongly about it then a client can use\n&gt; http://www.famkruithof.net/uuid/uuidgen\n&gt; to get GUID.\ncurl -v http://www.famkruithof.net/uuid/uuidgen\n(..)\n&lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n&lt; Date: Mon, 11 Jun 2007 20:45:53 GMT\n&lt; Server: Apache/2.2.3 (Debian) mod_ssl/2.2.3 OpenSSL/0.9.8c\n&lt; X-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.0-8+etch4\n&lt; Transfer-Encoding: chunked\n&lt; Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\n\nPerhaps not the most RESTful service for such :-)\n\n\n-- \nStian Soiland, myGrid team\nSchool of Computer Science\nThe University of Manchester\nhttp://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~ssoiland/\n\n\n\n"}}
