Maybe what she said is\nuntrue, but someone new to the list definitely gets the impression she\ngot...\n\n&gt; &gt; 1.  Authentication. Far as I can tell, all the options\n&gt; &gt; that are both RESTful and secure require something more\n&gt; &gt; than vanilla Web 0.1, and so I&#39;m stuck with Apache\n&gt; &gt; Basic Auth or something cookie-based. I think I&#39;m going\n&gt; &gt; to go with the latter, because being able to log out is\n&gt; &gt; pretty important, I think. Tentatively, I&#39;d go with a\n&gt; &gt; scheme wherein there&#39;s a login form with a\n&gt; &gt; username/password, host returns a username/session\n&gt; &gt; token. A bit RESTless, but nothing beyond the token\n&gt; &gt; itself is stored in the server-side session, so I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; thinking the damage to RESTfulness is minimal. So is\n&gt; &gt; security, but it&#39;s better than transmitting the\n&gt; &gt; password in the clear every time. Slightly\n&gt; \n&gt; Use cookies; abstract your login code out of the view so\n&gt; that it can be reused when some a non-browser client\n&gt; wants to authenticate.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you want to see a system that does cookies +\n&gt; www-authenticate, look at Zope2/Plone. There&#39;s plenty of\n&gt; implementation in there.\n \nCan you give some more specific examples?  Zope/Plone are a rather large and\nlarge apps don&#39;t make for good example code unless a person has a week or\ntwo to install and get to know the architecture first.\n\n&gt; Try not to log users out with GET (if you must show a \n&gt; link, at least trap it and call POST via javascript).\n\nWhy not? (honest question, trying to learn.)\n\n&gt; &gt; 2.  That darn &quot;there&#39;s something beyond GET and POST?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; thing. I&#39;m pretty much stuck with overloaded POST, I\n&gt; &gt; think. Happily, the application I&#39;m writing is\n&gt; &gt; naturally heavier on true POSTs than PUTs, at least.\n&gt; &gt; And I&#39;m not at all clear on what horrible things can\n&gt; &gt; happen (again, in *practice*) with overloaded POST, at\n&gt; &gt; least in an environment where dumb browser is\n&gt; &gt; constrained (barring malice/stupidity) by the forms fed\n&gt; &gt; to it by a server aware of its dumbness\n&gt; Live with POST, understand the implications of\n&gt; overloading. Mostly, the implication is that frameworks\n&gt; (and standards) that derive from the worldview that\n&gt; everything&#39;s a form or a CGI suck. They are optimized for\n&gt; you to write stupid code by default. To be clear, that&#39;s\n&gt; a lot of frameworks, and a lot of specs. If you&#39;ve only\n&gt; ever worked inside such frameworks and to such standards\n&gt; (eg if your experience is limited to RPC WS-* stacks\n&gt; and/or Struts action controllers), you might think it&#39;s\n&gt; fine in the same way Blub programmers think Blub is fine.\n \nWhy do they suck? (again, honest question, trying to learn.)\n \n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org - http://t.oolicio.us\n\n\n\n\n"}}
