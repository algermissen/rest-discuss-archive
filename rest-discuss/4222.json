HTTP\nDELETE is defined as deleting the entire resource, but I want to be\nable to delete just one of possibly many representations of a given\nresource.\n\nThe two options I have thought of are:\na) Abuse the Accept header: if it appears in a DELETE request, delete\n   the representations of the resource that are in the media types\n   specified in that header field.  If it isn&#39;t present, delete the\n   resource and all its representations.\nb) Use PUT with a Content-Type header but an empty body to &#39;overwrite&#39;\n   an existing representation with a &#39;null&#39; one.\n\nThe second of these doesn&#39;t seem to me to mean the same thing as\ndeleting a representation - I don&#39;t see why an empty representation\ncouldn&#39;t be meaningful for some applications.\n\nAm I overlooking an obvious solution?\n\n- Stephen\n\n\n\n"}}
