For the same reason you want uniformity in methods, you \n&gt; &gt; &gt; want one preferred URI for identifying a resource. The \n&gt; server should \n&gt; &gt; &gt; redirect requests for other equivalent URIs to the preferred one. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Althought that&#39;s not quite what you are asking, I think it is the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; answer.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m curious why you make the above statement. Is there a \n&gt; W3C finding \n&gt; &gt; that documents this, or some other paper? I&#39;ve been doing a \n&gt; &gt; significant amount of research on URLs and URI best \n&gt; practices in the \n&gt; &gt; past 3+ months and have found nothing like this (though I \n&gt; could have \n&gt; &gt; missed it.)\n&gt; \n&gt; It is inherent in the power laws of economics, the network \n&gt; effect of Metcalfe, the PageRank of Google, and I am sure it \n&gt; is mentioned somewhere in webarch.  A gave a presentation to \n&gt; the W3C Tech Plenary that described it using a single graph \n&gt; that is bisected when other sites start referring to two \n&gt; separate URIs for the same resource.\n&gt; \n&gt; When the best resources on the Web are identified by the \n&gt; sites that link to them, introducing multiple URIs for the \n&gt; same resource has the effect of exponentially decreasing its \n&gt; perceived value.\n&gt; \n&gt; It also decreases cache efficiency, but resource owners don&#39;t \n&gt; respect that as much as the PageRank argument.\n\nCan you please address the usability issue I raised?  You addressed the\ntechnical issues, but not the usability issues.\n\nWouldn&#39;t this argue for additional authoritative metadata in HTTP headers\nand HTML &lt;head&gt; elements that both browsers and search engines can use to\naddress the issues you raise?\n\nFYI, I&#39;ve been doing a lot of research in this area, reading everything I\ncould find the web and more on the subject, and have plans to publishing a\nlot of comments regarding this as well as and make calls for this metadata\non the WDUI blog [1] over the next year.  I&#39;ve even come across documents\nyou&#39;ve written that I believed would imply such a thing (but their URLs are\nnot readily available; I still have lots of information sorting and\nclassifying left to do. But I will reference those writing when I publish.)\nHopefully you&#39;ll agree there is a need for better metadata, especially from\nweb apps (blogs, wikis, CMS systems, etc.) that can correctly manage such\nmetadata.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n\n[1] http://blog.welldesignedurls.org/\n\n\n"}}
