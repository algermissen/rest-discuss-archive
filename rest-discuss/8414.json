It *can* be the case, within the\nconstraints of REST, that the server chooses to set only the\nproperties provided in the representation included in the PUT request,\nand leaves the other ones with their previous values (partial update).\n What&#39;s important from a REST POV is that the server (and\nintermediaries) understands that the client isn&#39;t requesting this to\nhappen, and so the client should be just as happy if the request\nobliterated previous values, reset them to defaults, made them random\nvalues, or whatever...\n\nBut [1] sure does look like it&#39;s redefining the meaning of PUT, so I\nhope that&#39;s fixed.  I&#39;m pretty certain the spec doesn&#39;t say that\nthough, unless it was changed after my review.\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
