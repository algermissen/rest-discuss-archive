If you offer notification,\n&gt; you create URLs which represent the stream of\n&gt; changes to some other URL (or collection of URLs).\n&gt; The recipient then gets a chunk encoded stream of\n&gt; update messages.\n\nThis is a weird abuse of HTTP. Chunks are supposed to be used to make\ndata flow more efficient, not to indicate changes in state across time.\nAn intermediary might choose to group chunks to merge them or re-chunk\nfor performance reasons.\n\nData formats are about the structure of bytes in a stream.\n\nProtocols are about the timing of when data moves across a pipe. You&#39;re\nabusing a data format (mime/multipart) to invent a new protocol. REST\nphilosophy (like Mao Zedung-thought) says you shouldn&#39;t have to do that.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
