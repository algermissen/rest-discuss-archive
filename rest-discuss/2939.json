And you do discovery on the service, not the\n&gt; objects.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yep, I think that&#39;s the key difference.\n&gt; \n\nHmmmm....\n\nI&#39;m not really sure I see what you mean by this. In regular usage of a\nJava SOA toolkit you would take one object and create a WSDL doc from\nit.  The WSDL doc is a single service.  I would say that means one\nservice represents one object.\n\nToivo Lainevool\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
