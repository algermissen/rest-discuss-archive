So, I believe the m=\r\nost natural\n&gt; solution would be to encode the resource scoping information =\r\nin the URI\n&gt; like this:\n&gt; \n&gt; GET /computers/1+2+3+4+5+6/temperature\n&gt; \n&gt; bu=\r\nt of course this doesn&#39;t scale beyond a certain limit (the URI gets to\n&gt; la=\r\nrge and hits the limits of the most popular HTTP servers).\n&gt; \n&gt; The alterna=\r\ntive would be to first save your subset of computer IDs on\n&gt; the server by =\r\ncreating a new temporary resource with a PUT or a POST and\n&gt; then reference=\r\n it in a GET. However this looks cumbersome, and leads to\n&gt; 2 requests when=\r\n 1 would do it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Plus, if the service was meant to be read-only it woul=\r\ndn&#39;t even be\n&gt; possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; What would be a possible RESTful approach her=\r\ne?\n\nFWIW, I try to leverage domain concepts to define resources that corres=\r\npond to sets of things (and combine those with query params for refinement)=\r\n.\n\nIn your case, you might want to look for machines that form sets, e.g. a=\r\nll-load-balancers, or all-nodes-on-floor-14, or whatever makes sense. It is=\r\n pretty unlikely that you have a requirement to fetch information about a g=\r\nroup of things without that group being somehow a domain concept, too.\n\nJan=\r\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; Free Ekanayaka\n&gt; \n&gt; PS: it seems that other people alr=\r\neady have raised this issue, for\n&gt; example the real-life problem I describe=\r\nd is a variation of the sample\n&gt; problem described here:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://blog.l=\r\nabix.org/2009/07/23/accessing-restful-information-efficiently\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
