I&#39;ll use new URIs for clarity, plus generalize it a little\nto show how it&#39;s not specific to squaring;\n\nGET on http://example.org/integers returns a GET form with a single\nparameter &quot;number&quot;\n\nI enter &quot;4&quot;, hit submit, and get some information on the number four\nfrom the URI http://example.org/integers?number=4, perhaps something\nlike;\n\n&quot;Four&quot; (4).  See it;\n&lt;a rel=&quot;http://math.example.org/square&quot; href=&quot;/integers?number=16&quot;&gt;squared&lt;/a&gt;, and\n&lt;a rel=&quot;http://math.example.org/square-root&quot; href=&quot;/integers?number=2&quot;&gt;square rooted&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis is getting away from Walden&#39;s original example, since the URIs\nidentify the numbers, not some other thing that happens to have the\nvalue.  But I wanted to focus on explaining how links could be used,\nand this was the easiest way.\n\nBTW, ignore the square root bit before.  &quot;rev&quot; doesn&#39;t work like that.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
