But if the REST critique of \n&gt; POST-only services is right, we can expect to see these replaced by more \n&gt; addressable, GET-accessable SOAP services, just as we saw Frames pretty \n&gt; much vanish from mainstream use. Most Web sites don&#39;t use HTML Frames, \n&gt; because using them turns out to be a pain. The critiques we&#39;re hearing \n&gt; about POST-only SOAP have a lot in common with the various critiques of \n&gt; frames (URIs, addressability etc). Maybe we&#39;ll see a similar \n&gt; adoption/migration curve...?\n\nI&#39;d like to believe that it was this easy, but at least frames were\nretrievable without prior coordination.  They broke a handful or\narchitectural principles, but they didn&#39;t try to reinvent the entire\narchitecture like the vast majority of POST based Web services do.\n\n&gt; ps. my sense that frames were quite widely adopted and then slowly \n&gt; abandoned is based on memory, anecdote etc. Does anyone know of a survey \n&gt; that puts hard figures to this claim?\n\nThat&#39;s my recollection too, but I don&#39;t know of any studies.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
