The state remains within the &#39;origin server&#39; and clients can\ninteract with the object only through sending and receiving representations\nof the object.\n\nMany discussions show fairly long URI with a lot of information in it, but\nthat is not intended to be the /state/ of the object.\n\nDo you have any examples that made it look like the URI had the full state\nof the object?\n\n\n\n"}}
