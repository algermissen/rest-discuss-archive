Well, that’s application state, and keeping\napplication state on the client is half the definition of REST.\n\nIt also has nothing to do with the use case that the REST book\ntalks about on p.253 that you quoted.\n\nWhat I don’t like so much about your description is that the\nJavascript’s going to CONSTRUCT user-specific URIs based on the\nID in the cookie. Normally, this would be a violation of the\nhypermedia constraint. OTOH, forms involve URI construction, but\nthey’re OK because they’re hypermedia published by the server;\nand here we have Code on Demand, which in a way is a Turing-\ncomplete kind of form. Coupling, which is what hypermedia aims\nto resolve, is not an issue, since the code is published by the\nserver anyway and so can change whenever the server does.\n\nSo it’s not critical for your Javascript to follow links as\nopposed to constructing URIs. Whether or not it should do so\ndepends on the flexibility you need to build into it. If you\nconstruct URIs, then the Javascript needs to have awareness of\nthe URI space built into it, so if your URI space layout grows\ncomplex, so will the Javascript. Then it would probably be better\nfor the Javascript to use hypermedia. However as long as the URI\nspace layout is simple, it may not be worth the bother to bake\nhypermedia into the Javascript.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
