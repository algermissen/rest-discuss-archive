In particular, verisign server certs don&#39;t\nactually involve the real world at all.  Instead\nthey involve the world of corporate documents and\nproviding bona-fides as a business.\n\nNote: Versign actually guarantees something weaker\nthan what I describe above.  If company A buys a\ndomain name from Company B and then obtains a\ncert, you are not actually guaranteed that there\nis continuity of identity.\n\nNote: The economic function of a CA is to insure\nagainst key compromise.  One could think of CA\ncosts as insurance premiums rather than rents.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.

Online, it&#39;s just a guarantee of continuity of some kind.  I.e., the\n&gt; person doing this thing today is the same person who did it yesterday.  In\n&gt; order to prove that continuity, all that&#39;s needed is a persistent secret that\n&gt; only the principal in question knows, which can be used in a zero-knowledge\n&gt; fashion.  This can easily be done with 2 parties and relatively mild crypto.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tying that in any useful way to the &quot;real world&quot; notion of identities is\n&gt; probably unnecessary for most or all applications, and often undesirable.\n&gt; And that tying is the only reason for a trust relationship with a third-party\n&gt; authentication / cert agent.\n&gt;\n&gt; jb\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
