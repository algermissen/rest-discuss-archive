It implements a state machine construct that is driven by event=\r\ns from an underlying platform. On each transisiton it can run javascript an=\r\nd send messages back down to the platform. It can also put together a GET o=\r\nr a POST using javascript variables to set the equivalent of form inputs.\n\n=\r\nThis sort of model could work for more than just call control (what CCXML i=\r\ns designed for). Hypermedia tells the client how to map inputs to an HTTP r=\r\nequest -- that basic concept is the same in HTML and CCXML.\n\nAndrew\n\n--- In=\r\n rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Bill Burke &lt;bburke@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Sol=\r\nomon Duskis wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Using link doesn&#39;t seem all that natural to me.
