That explains why I couldn&#39;t find it in my rest-discuss\nfolder. 8-)\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t know whether there is really anything we disagree upon. My\n&gt; opinions on MEP are as follows:\n\nYah, we&#39;re in agreement.  Just a couple of observations ...\n\n&gt;  * request/response is the best choice of primitive MEP for a system\n&gt; that depends heavily on the results of dereferencing URIs. Plus, today&#39;s\n&gt; Internet topology makes request/response essentially always available\n&gt; but bidirectional asynch is much harder to roll out. Businesses and ISPs\n&gt; mostly do not want people outside making connections in, therefore the\n&gt; only way to get information in is through a response to an outgoing\n&gt; connection. (with the exception of email, but we know how happy\n&gt; businesses are with random people sending email to their employees)\n\nMaybe just a terminology issue, but I don&#39;t know that anybody&#39;s\nquestioning request/response.  All messages can be characterized as one\nof those.  I think the simplicity you&#39;re referring to, has to do with\nthe implicit correlation of requests and responses by virtue of them\nreusing the same connection, and that each request has a single\nresponse.  I concur with that.\n\n&gt;  * A highly interoperable system like the Web could have multiple MEPs,\n&gt; as long as *all server implementations* support all of them. If you must\n&gt; &quot;configure&quot; your client to contact a server by informing it what MEP to\n&gt; use then you are starting down a slippery slope that ends in WSDL and\n&gt; UDDI -- not as options but as requirements for getting actual work done.\n&gt; This is what I object to in SOAP.\n\nMEPs don&#39;t do anything except describe ways in which the underlying\nprotocol can be used.  So there&#39;s no issue of extended agreement, since\nby virtue of using a protocol, you already know what needs to be known\nin order to support any MEP that fits.\n\nThis isn&#39;t quite as straightforward as it sounds.  For example, one\ncould built a multicast MEP with HTTP.  Obviously HTTP doesn&#39;t support\nthat by itself, but by using a URI to identify a multicast group, then\ndefining what the HTTP methods should do on it (e.g. GET blocks until\nall members of the group have responded, then returns a multipart\nmessage/http envelope - or whatever), you have built something new that\ncan be deployed without new agreement.\n\n&gt;  * Nevertheless, if a system like the Web has only a single MEP, others\n&gt; can built on top of it. Whether these others are standardized or not is\n&gt; orthogonal to whether they are primitive. At the very least,\n&gt; notification should be standardized. Making new MEPs primitive is\n&gt; probably too difficult at this point.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
