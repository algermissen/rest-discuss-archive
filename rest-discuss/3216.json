In some index leaf\n&gt; page a pointer to the actual URI would be found.  There would be no way\n&gt; to interpret the URI structure, because it doesn&#39;t have any: the\n&gt; mapping from order numbers to URIs is basically random.  Completely\n&gt; opaque.\nNot actually completely opaque. The client needs to know the format and\nstructure of two documents. Either that&#39;s hardcoded - and hard things are\nbrittle - or the server describes the format (which gets you into a\nrecursive definition of how you describe information and find what you want\nfrom that description).\nIf you go with the server description approach, then the server can just as\neasily describe the format of the URI. If the server changes the structure,\nthe defintion changes - clients automatically adopt the new format.\n\n&gt; The alternative approach suggested by S. Mike Dierken was to put\n&gt; the order number in the uri.  Easy to interpret, totally not opaque.\nAdd in a server description of how to construct the URI and you reduce the\ncoupling. I do realize that constructing URIs can be avoided in many\nsituations, but I think it adds implementation complexity for not a lot of\nbenefit. Just my opinion though.\n\n&gt; My sense is that if the goal is: &quot;Given a set of parameters, find the\n&gt; corresponding URI&quot;, there is only one ReSTful alternative, namely the\n&gt; inefficient search method described above.\nWell stated goal. And very good question - is there only one RESTful\napproach?\nI see two non-URI based approaches\n a) successive GETs and matching against response content\n b) POSTing some content with the parameter (the purchase order number) and\nreceiving the actual location\n\nThe URI-based approach might be simpler to implement, and a server-provided\ndescription of the structure of the URI reduces coupling, but defining a URI\nstructure probably is going to limit the server to hosting the resources in\na simple container (like a database) otherwise the description gets too\ncomplicated (although a re-direct would let you put things anywhere else\ntoo). Using the non-URI based approaches lets you put the resources anywhere\non the Web.\n\nSo... for me, I&#39;d do something simple when the job is simple and do\nsomething large when the problem is large. Small steps toward automation are\nbetter than no steps at all.\n\n\n\n"}}
