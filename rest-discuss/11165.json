As resource orientation don&#39;t have any\n&gt;&gt;&gt; clear path for resources changing _over time_, it becomes a question\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for you whether you regard your resource as backwards compatible to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; some other version of itself. At some point there&#39;s perhaps a need for\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a totally new version, so why not have that as part of the URI when it\n&gt;&gt;&gt; *is* a different resource?\n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, Aug 8, 2008 at 23:07, Bill de hOra &lt;bill@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it&#39;s generally accepted. In a REST based approach you cut a new URL for\n&gt;&gt; a new Resource, and you negotiate on well known content types.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hang on, this doesn&#39;t clash with what I said. I do a lot of modeling\n&gt; through resource orientation, so even if I use the same resource types\n&gt; and notions, they may exist in different models and have very\n&gt; different semantics ;\n&gt; \n&gt;    http://example.com/model1/topic/1234\n&gt;    http://example.com/model2/topic/1234\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t see the problem with this (apart from people parsing meta data\n&gt; from the URI which they should not do).\n\n\nhttp://example.com/model1/createTopic\nhttp://example.com/model2/createTopic\n\nso it depends on what you mean by semantics. One problem is that clients \n  have to rev to get new &#39;features&#39;, especially around posting or \nobtaining extra content. Or you have to support a lot of legacy clients \non a single server codebase. Stuff like Atom/HTML/AtomPub makes some of \nthe problems go away at the cost of more abstraction than (it seems) a \nlot of people can stomach, else their wouldn&#39;t be so many RPC-REST \nhybrid APIs (and actually calling them APIs is arguably indicative of a \nproblem).\n\n\n&gt;&gt; For custom content types you end up versioning those as well\n&gt; \n&gt; Isn&#39;t that a very expensive process, especially for the standardized\n&gt; and popular ones?\n\nMost of the problems with custom types are that they are done for \nexpedience and people unintentionally create new versions because \nprocessing rules are never defined. This can cause problems with \nseemingly trivial changes:\n\n&lt;comment&gt;\n  &lt;title/&gt;\n  &lt;text/&gt;\n&lt;/comment&gt;\n\n\n&lt;comment&gt;\n  &lt;text/&gt;\n  &lt;title/&gt;\n&lt;/comment&gt;\n\nAre they different versions? It depends.\n\nTake a look at the formats here:\n\nhttp://dehora.net/journal/2008/03/08/network-address-book/\n\nI went through this with someone in work today who isn&#39;t a protocol/web \nnerd. There&#39;s no question the MSFT version was the easiest to \ncomprehend. It&#39;s probably marshall to/from the CLR, since the element \nnames are clearly optimised for that, but it arguably has the least \ngeneral purpose utility or reach. I suspect it&#39;s *extremely* unintuitive.\n\nBill\n\n"}}
