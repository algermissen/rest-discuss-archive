Via expensive proprietary software.  Hyperlinks \ncould turn at least the links into infrastructure.\n\nThere are similar dependencies and ripple effects of change in many \nother domains, e.g. software development.\n\nThere should be a terrific REST story rippling through these links.\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
