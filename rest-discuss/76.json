If one thinks about the minimal amount need to add\n&quot;asynch&quot; to HTTP it is a way for a client to tell the server where to\nsend the response when it becomes available. You need a reply-to: header\nwith an IP address and a port. The server returns &quot;900: Sure, I&#39;ll get\nback to you when I can&quot;. When the server completes a (potentially long)\ncomputation, it makes a TCP connection to the port and returns a result.\nThis would be good where the basic pattern is request-response but the\ncomputation may take very long (especially in a workflow-type situation)\nand the client doesn&#39;t want to keep a socket open for days or weeks on\nend.\n\nOn the other hand, notifications is about reporting when a resource\nchanges. The primary virtue of notifications is that they break the\nrequest-response pattern of HTTP. So it is *more than asynch behaviour*\nthat is interesting in notifications. It is multi-response. In my &quot;pure&quot;\nasynch HTTP you could only emulate multi-response by making multiple\nrequests.\n\nI think you are interested in notifications, not just asych HTTP.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
