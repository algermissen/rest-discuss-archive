The debate is about creating media types to\ntrigger specific m2m application behaviors, which is the sort of\ncoupling we&#39;re seeking to avoid by using REST in the first place.  My\nXBEL example is m2m, but the application behavior is beyond the scope\nof what a media type can do -- whether to import it as bookmarks or\ntransform it into HTML for manipulation is dictated by hypertext, not\nthe string appearing in Content-Location.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Tangling a machine application up in HTML raises the barrier to entry\n&gt; vs. a more succinct machine type that is built for purpose. People in\n&gt; the real world want lower barriers to adoption.\n&gt; \n\nCreating new media types for shopping carts and order forms, when each\nuse case has been done a million times in HTML, based on the notion\nthat HTML can&#39;t also be machine readable, raises the barrier to\nadoption and goes against REST.  This is pragmatic advice, despite your\nconsistent hurling of ad hominems to the contrary, and is worth\nrepeating given the rise of RDFa.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; If you find in the future that there is a real requirement for an HTML\n&gt; interface to your application, then provide it additionally by\n&gt; leveraging content negotiation.\n&gt; \n\nIt&#39;s ridiculous to suggest that REST can be hacked on later somehow via\nconneg.  The real requirement is to extend a limited set of standardized\nsemantics across network boundaries (to paraphrase the thesis).  The\ngoal of REST is not to have 1,000 media types dedicated to order forms\nand shopping carts, but for those APIs to be described using some sort\nof *standardized* data type.  You don&#39;t need an XBEL client to manage\nbookmarks, you can use a browser&#39;s intrinsic capability *or* an HTML\ninterface despite its being machine-oriented.\n\nI&#39;m not saying it has to be HTML, I&#39;m saying it may as well be --\nhumans need to be able to understand m2m APIs because it&#39;s humans who\nhave to code the m2m consumers.  The API needs to be documented\nsomewhere... why not make it a self-documenting API that a human coder\nof an m2m consumer can drive manually to gain the required understanding\nfor such a project?  In which case it needs to be accessible, and of\ncourse there&#39;s Code on Demand which means you&#39;ll need javascript\nbindings... HTML is the most-capable, fully-fleshed-out data type out\nthere for the common case of describing a hypertext API -- regardless\nof the nature of the user as human or machine.\n\nIf you feel I&#39;m being repetitive, then you always have the option of\nnot jumping in with a categorical rejection of using HTML to describe\nhypertext APIs due to machine orientation.  HTML has always been used to\ndescribe hypertext APIs, which have always been readable by machines,\nwhich is why this thread uses such an old-school example as a starting\npoint -- REST is a study of the phenomenon represented by the humble\nIANA registration form, which is easily extended to m2m without turning\nmedia types into data-format identifiers with magical powers to direct\napplication flow.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
