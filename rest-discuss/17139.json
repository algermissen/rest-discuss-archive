My problem is about tooling. I haven&#39;t seen anything \n&gt; that makes it easy to go from internal representation to HTML+RDFa and \n&gt; back again. That is why basic XML is so tempting - any development \n&gt; platform can do all the tedious and and error prone transformation work \n&gt; for you.\n\nIndeed, RDFa and Microdata aren&#39;t ideal MRD formats, they simply extend \nthe descriptive markup of HTML so that you can describe (in a machine \nreadable way) the things described within the HTML document. It&#39;s only \nsuited for specific use-cases and certainly isn&#39;t optimized for pure \nmachine to machine only situations.\n\nThat said, XML and JSON certainly aren&#39;t RESTful because 99.999999% of \nthe components on the network will precisely zero about your essentially \n&quot;made-up&quot; media type, and in order to stop a huge media type explosion \n(one for every possibly way of modelling the representation of every \nkind of data under the sun) what&#39;s really needed is a universal data \nmodel which can describe any kind of data unambiguously within the \nconstraints of a single serialization, the closest thing to this at the \nminute is RDF/XML, but that has it&#39;s own drawbacks and is quite old now.\n\nEssentially what I&#39;m saying is, there is no ideal media type to handle \nthe bulk of the worlds data at the minute, somebody really needs to make \none.\n\nHowever, caveat is that for pure machine to machine scenarios you only \nneed basic link semantics (something which says dereference this URI) \nand as soon as you add more, you may as well just use HTML(+RDFa).\n\nAFAICT, you&#39;re just one in a huge line of people who need a new media \ntype for mrd in m2m scenarios.\n\nBest,\n\nNathan\n\n&gt; One of the reasons for turning to REST is simplicity. By adding layers \n&gt; of RDFa onto HTML the API becomes more difficult to consume compared to \n&gt; a straight forward XML format. If I present a REST API to my customers \n&gt; that makes it (a lot) more difficult to consume than a SOAP API then I \n&gt; loose some of my selling points.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am probably wrong though - I do not think Fieldings thesis says \n&gt; anything about being simple, but that certainly is part of the percived \n&gt; goodness of REST amongst most people.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry for exposing my ignorance here, I am just trying to find an \n&gt; implementation that is both RESTful and easy to implement with the \n&gt; proper tools.\n&gt; \n&gt; /J�rn\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- From: &quot;Nathan&quot; &lt;nathan@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &quot;J�rn Wildt&quot; &lt;jw@...&gt;\n&gt; Cc: &quot;Rest Discussion List&quot; &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, December 28, 2010 12:45 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] Combining HTML and XML?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; J�rn Wildt wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; But how would the machine readable HTML look like?
