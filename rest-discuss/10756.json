How would using PATCH still be a part of\n&gt; uniform interface ?\n\nMy understanding (and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get corrected if I&#39;m wrong) is that\nthe interface is uniform due to the way the service tells the client\nwhat operations it can perform, not that the operations are particularly\npart of a particular set.  Of course the client needs to understand what\nto do if it gets some hypermedia serving an equivalent function as an\nHTML form that says &quot;invoke operation(PATCH) on URI&quot; instead of &quot;invoke\noperation(GET) on URI&quot;, but, as I see it, the way that the operation and\nits parameters is expressed using hypermedia is really where the\nuniformity comes in, e.g. the service has a uniform way to describe the\navailable state transitions away from the current resource.  The\nmechanics of actually performing those operations is secondary because\nit boils down to support for the underlying transfer protocol used.\nProbably not as important now, but may be extremely important for\nanything after HTTP/1.1.\n\n&gt; &gt;it is RESTful if there is some engine described\n&gt; &gt;by a representation provided by the origin server that instructs\n&gt; &gt;the client on what to do next.\n&gt; \n&gt; Do you mean that the representation returned from the origin server\n&gt; has a set of (hypermedia) links\n&gt; that allow it move about in the application?\n\nAgain, my understanding is that this is the essence of &quot;hypermedia as\nthe engine of application state&quot;, so I think the answer is &quot;yes&quot;.\n\nast\n-- \nAndrew S.
