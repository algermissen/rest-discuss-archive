In order to generate\n&gt; 1000000 hits on the target machine (&quot;take that capitalist bastards!&quot;)\n&gt; you&#39;d have to generate 1000000 notifications. Why wouldn&#39;t you just\n&gt; directly make the 1000000 GET connections and be done with it? Maybe for\n&gt; obfuscation but the point remains that the number of hits you generate\n&gt; is in the same ballpark as the number of notifications you make so it is\n&gt; really hard to make a serious hit.\n\nThis is an elegant and useful bit of reasoning.\n\nThe only remaining bit of DDoS (after the above) is that the watcher can\nbe tricked into generating watches against DDoS targets, given that a\nwatch often entails a polling loop.  Is this really a problem?  You can\nargue that a watcher actually reduces hits, given that it can act as an\naggregator for multiple clients&#39; individual polling loops.  ...\n\nHmmm.  There&#39;s a general problem of watched resources not wanting to be\nwatched.  Maybe they don&#39;t have the bandwidth to sustain polling loops,\nmaybe they&#39;re huge files.  It seems to me that there&#39;s an existing\nmechanism for handling this -- robots.txt.  Interesting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
