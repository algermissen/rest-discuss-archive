Or vice\nversa. SMTP has the same issue that HTTP does and I see nothing in the\nSMTP spec to indicate that there is a way to recognize that the client\nis retry-ing the send.\n\n            S: MAIL FROM:&lt;Smith@...&gt;\n            R: 250 OK\n\n            S: RCPT TO:&lt;Jones@...&gt;\n            R: 250 OK\n\n            S: RCPT TO:&lt;Green@...&gt;\n            R: 550 No such user here\n\n            S: RCPT TO:&lt;Brown@...&gt;\n            R: 250 OK\n\n            S: DATA\n            R: 354 Start mail input; end with &lt;CRLF&gt;.&lt;CRLF&gt;\n            S: Blah blah blah...\n            S: ...etc. etc. etc.\n            S: &lt;CRLF&gt;.&lt;CRLF&gt;\n            R: 250 OK\n\n&gt; Here is a short version of asynchronous callbacks\n&gt; using SMTP:\n&gt; \n&gt;    Send the message to the reply-to address using SMTP\n\nYou can do the same in HTTP. Just return a reply-to address. *BUT*.\n*BUT*. *BUT*. The part you&#39;re missing is that we are trying to identify\nwhat makes the web such a great, scalable, interoperable, popular system\nand extend that into the domain of asynch, events, etc. reply-to is\ntrivial. But what if you want to say that you DON&#39;T want the reply any\nmore? What if you want to have a centralized list of the things you are\nexpecting replies about? If you haven&#39;t given the reply-request a URI\nthen you can&#39;t do these things.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; \n&gt; Terrorist_or_not.com uses RPC to deliver the\n&gt; queries.  The target of the POST is a function not\n&gt; a resource.\n\nThat is not the definition of RPC. What&#39;s wrong with a function being a\nresource? It becomes RPC when the function starts dispatching on method\nnames and setting up private namespaces.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
