But how did you know that it makes sense to write code that  \nlooks for the rel=&quot;next&quot; in the first place? Or: how did you know it  \nmakes sense to expect that the response would be available in  \napplication/atom+xml?\n\nAs a human, you do the GET, see what is returned and if you understand  \nit. Then, if you do, you know what you can do next. All fine.\n\nWhen coding a client, however, you need to know at design time that it  \nmakes sense to expect application/atom+xml to be returned. There might  \nbe other possible media types available, too, but you need some source  \nof information that is the source for this expectation.\n\nAtomPub, for example, does state that collections are available as  \napplication/atom+xml feed documents. And it needs to do so because  \notherwise, building a client would not be possible.\n\nAtomPub cannot make that statement without using the term &#39;collection&#39;  \nand specifying how a client knows that a resource is a (sic!!)  \ncollection[1]. An AtomPub collection is a resource kind (or class or  \ncategory or role type or type or whatever you name it).\n\nJan\n\n\n[1] And it does so (more or less implicitly) by saying that whatever  \nURIs you find in the href attributes of a service document&#39;s  \ncollection elements refers to collections. When I see\n\n&lt;collection href=&quot;http://foo/orders&quot;&gt; I know a bunch of things about  \nthe resource identfied by http://foo/orders. E.g. I know that a GET on  \nit will return an Atom feed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
