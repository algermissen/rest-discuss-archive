The REST architectural style is orthogonal to\nwhatever\n&gt; &gt; programming paradigm you prefer to develop in.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t actually agree with this.  While it&#39;s true that any\n&gt; computationally complete facility can be used to express any other\n&gt; similar facility --- this is all about universality, etc. --- that\n&gt; doesn&#39;t mean that they are all equivalent.  I can model functions as\n&gt; objects;  I can model objects as functions; etc. etc. etc. &#39;til the cows\n&gt; come home.  However, that&#39;s not a particularly useful observation:\n&gt; similarly, that&#39;s like saying that OOP is orthogonal to whatever\n&gt; programming language you happen to be using.  While it&#39;s true that you\n&gt; can do OOP even in e.g. assembly, it sure ain&#39;t easy. ;-)\n\nThis is a very good point.\n\n&gt; My point is that REST the architectural style may *be* or *imply* a\n&gt; particular programming paradigm;  consideration of that issue has been\n&gt; particularly helpful to me in understanding and quantifying certain\n&gt; things about REST.\n\nOK, this is certainly reasonable. But I like to think of using REST as being\nsomething similiar to the using the relational database model. Does\naccessing a relational database imply any one particular programming\nparadigm to you? From experience, I would certainly say that it doesn&#39;t\nimply OO but that doesn&#39;t prevent me from using it usefully from OO\nlanguages. REST is unique when compared to programming languages (simply\nbecause it isn&#39;t a programming language but rather an architectural style as\nyou pointed out) and needs to be evaluated independently from them. Maybe it\nwill be easier to use a RESTful architecture from certain types of languages\nbut that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that REST should be considered as being of\nthat language&#39;s paradigm.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    &quot;OOP is to CORBA as ??? is to the Web.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; OOP and CORBA are not related exlusively to all other programming\nparadigms\n&gt; &gt; or architectural styles. It&#39;s just as possible to develop a monolithic\n&gt; &gt; procedural API using CORBA as it is an object oriented one. The same\ngoes\n&gt; &gt; for REST.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think you&#39;re missing something important, but can&#39;t quite put my\n&gt; finger on how to explain it to you.\n\nIf I am missing something, then please don&#39;t stop trying to beat it into me\nuntil I finally get it. :-)\n\nJason\n\n\n\n"}}
