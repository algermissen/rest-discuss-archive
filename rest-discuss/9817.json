That is the truly RESTf=\r\nul\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; way to do a shopping cart.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This sounds good. H=\r\nowever now the burden falls on the client to\nmaintain\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cart an=\r\nd if the client crashes, it cannot restore the data unless\nit is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stor=\r\ned some where on the client. For a truly thin client this may\nor not\n&gt; &gt; be=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a viable option.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If the client is a browser, then it tends t=\r\no store its URL history\nin\n&gt; &gt; persistent storage, so even if it crashes yo=\r\nu can go back to the\nlast\n&gt; &gt; state of your basket.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Of course, this=\r\n is only valid if your application implements the\nbasket\n&gt; &gt; using GET rath=\r\ner than POST. I would argue that using GET is the only\n&gt; &gt; sensible way to =\r\ndo it for browsers, even if it leads to unwieldy\nlooking\n&gt; &gt; URLs, as users=\r\n inevitably use the back button and expect to return\nto the\n&gt; &gt; previous st=\r\nate. Only the last part (payment/confirmation) of the\nprocess\n&gt; &gt; should us=\r\ne POST.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Some of this logic is true if the client is not a browser and=\r\n can\n&gt; persistently and reliably manage the state on the client side. If we=\r\nb\n&gt; browsers are primary clients, I would argue that the shopping cart be\n&gt;=\r\n treated as a resource and use POST to manipulate its state (such as\nadding=\r\n\n&gt; and deleting items). In this model the state is managed by the server.\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Subbu\n&gt;\n\nI think it boils down to whether the shopping cart eventually b=\r\necomes\nresource state (the server stores) or it remains as application stat=\r\ne\n(client only stores).  One could argue that a shopping cart (and the\nitem=\r\ns in it) are application state and that immediately you click\n&quot;purchase&quot; an=\r\nd order is created (which becomes resource state) and the\nshopping cart goe=\r\ns away.\n\nHowever if you want to expose a shopping cart as a resource, your\n=\r\ninteraction will be different.  It ultimately boils down to what you\nreally=\r\n want to do.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
