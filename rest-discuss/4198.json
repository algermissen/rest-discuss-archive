Maybe\n&gt; I am just not grasping the finer details, but this doesn&#39;t seem like a\n&gt; valid REST approach.  And to complicate it more, suppose that I had\n&gt; performed a T-DELETE instead.  Now, the URI returns an Etag of &quot;1&quot; and\n&gt; the T-URI is no longer mapped.  Again, this does not feel RESTful at \n&gt; all.\n\nThere are many ways to implement transactions (meaning: making several\nactions seem atomic).  Isolation is not a property of transactions -- it\nis only a property of workspaces (one implementation of transactions).\nIf you insist on having that property, then you&#39;ll have to live with\nits limitations as well.  For example, do you want a wire transfer\ndeposit to fail just because you happen to be using your ATM card\nat the same time?  The fact is that many simultaneous transactions\ncan safely take place on the same resources if you don&#39;t force the\nserver into a single model.  The right thing to do is tell the server\nwhat you are doing and let it figure out the right implementation\naccording to the types of resources it is trying to protect.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
