Care needs to be taken when saying a \n&quot;description language is unnecessary&quot; as you need to identify \nwhat kind of language you&#39;re referring to. E.g. when I wrote \nthis [2] I think I was mostly discussing a form description \nlanguage. Or maybe not...\n\nWould anyone care to suggest a concrete definitions for &quot;form\ndescription&quot; and &quot;service description&quot;?\n\nIt&#39;s just that I can imagine taking a bunch of RDF Form data, and \nthen using that to identify a service that returns data in a format \nI&#39;m interested in. Is that not &quot;service description&quot;?\n\nNot that I&#39;m disagreeing with anything, just trying to home in \non the differences.\n\nCheers,\n\nL.\n\n[1].\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca/2002/09/Blog/2005/03/01#de\nliciousdistobj.hughw__REST_and...uages\n[2]. http://www.ldodds.com/blog/archives/000190.html\n\n\n\n\n"}}
