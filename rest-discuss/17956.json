By\n=\r\ndoing the &quot;mashup&quot; on the server, there are more opportunities to\noptimize =\r\nthe experience in the future (the server can change storage\nmodels, object =\r\nmodels, re-arrange code, move operations to other\nservers, etc. all w/o adv=\r\nersely affecting the client).\n\nAlso, by setting up an expectation that clie=\r\nnts will &quot;get what they\nneed&quot; in a single call, you can lead server impleme=\r\nntations down the\npath of publicizing a resource model that reflects the ac=\r\ntual\ndomain-specific needs of the client-server interaction instead of\npubl=\r\nicizing a resource model based on the server-side data storage or\ncoding ob=\r\nject models. This does a better job of separating concerns,\ntoo.\n\nFinally, =\r\nsince the HTTP protocol has a rich set of caching controls,\nmuch of the &quot;co=\r\nst&quot; of chunky messages (and the effort to compose them\non the server) can b=\r\ne mitigated w/ a cache directives sent along with\nthe response. Even compos=\r\nite resources that experience heavy editing\nwill do well in this cache/chun=\r\nky environment by adding etags to the\ncache controls.\n\nOn a related note, J=\r\non Moore&#39;s 2010 presentation at Oredev[1] shows an\napproach that allows ser=\r\nvers to implement resource messages that can\nbe either chunky or chatty and=\r\n allows clients to sort details out on\nthe fly. A rather interesting approa=\r\nch since it allows implementations\nto safely &quot;experiment&quot; w/ optimizing the=\r\n interactions &quot;in real time.&quot;\n\nHope this helps.\n\nMCA\n\n[1] http://oredev.org=\r\n/2010/sessions/hypermedia-apis\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\nhttp://twitter=\r\n.com@mamund\nhttp://mamund.com/foaf.rdf#me\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Nov 10, 2011 at 08:2=\r\n2, Jim Purbrick &lt;jimpurbrick@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; We&#39;re building what will h=\r\nopefully be a fairly RESTful API with\n&gt; hyperlinked resources and collectio=\r\nn resources representing one to\n&gt; many relationships.\n&gt;\n&gt; The collection re=\r\nsources always contain canonical URIs for each\n&gt; element, but what else?\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Often authors of client apps would also like names, so the members of\n&gt; t=\r\nhe collection can be presented in a list to the user and selected\n&gt; from.
