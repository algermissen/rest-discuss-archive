My question was rather mundane:  assuming some arbitrary  \nsyntax / delimiter, does anybody have any existing Python / Apache or  \nother gadgetry that does this?  I.e., if I just huck a standard Python  \nCGI up on our Apache server, Apache is going to be &quot;friendly&quot; and  \nflatten out all of the params to pass to the first resource in the  \npipeline, which will then have to reassemble them.  I guess that&#39;s  \ntrivial, though, isn&#39;t it?  Just ignore all the params and parse the  \nURI directly.  Hmmm...\n\nJust wanted to know if anybody done this kind of thing;  we discussed  \nit a while back, but I wasn&#39;t sure if that was a mostly academic  \ndiscussion.\n\njb\n\n\nOn Wednesday, September 25, 2002, at 03:33  PM, Jeffrey Winter wrote:\n\n&gt; You&#39;ll have to parse the URL yourself, but why not break it up\n&gt; using &quot;;&quot;:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://host1/res1/res2?parm1=x;host2/res1/res2?parm2=y;host3/x\n&gt;\n&gt; - Winter\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;Jeff Bone&quot; &lt;jbone@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &quot;Mathews, Walden&quot; &lt;waldenm@...&gt;\n&gt; Cc: &quot;John Fletcher&quot; &lt;john.fletcher@...&gt;;\n&gt; &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, September 25, 2002 4:11 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] Retraction, advice sought, code offered\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Wednesday, September 25, 2002, at 02:55  PM, Mathews, Walden wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I object to your desire for URI readability; it implies that you\n&gt;&gt; are planning to do something unsafe, like use a URI as though it\n&gt;&gt; was a function call with parameters.\n&gt;\n&gt; See ---  THIS is exactly why I rant about URI opacity.
