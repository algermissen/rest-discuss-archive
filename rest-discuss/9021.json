Basically you cannot tell the difference between a processor\n&gt; that has failed and one that has stopped. This result is used in\n&gt; the CAP paper.\n\nwe use a partition aware tuple space (Anubis) for this kind of thing;\nit does have heartbeats so it only works on a single site, where\nmulticast costs and delays are low. The nice thing about the design is\nyou can assert facts, then one tick later know all nodes know the\nfact, two ticks later they know you know, three ticks later you know\nthey know...and so on until you get the levels of mutual knowledge\nwhere you can start to make assertions:\nhttp://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2005/HPL-2005-72.html\nhttp://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2005/HPL-2005-73.html\n\n\n&gt;I did some work on using Paxos Commit and HTTP together to support\n&gt;distributed transactions, though the transactions did not have full ACID\n&gt;properties. http://www.allhands.org.uk/2006/proceedings/papers/624.pdf\n\nA paper with Steve Pickles on the list and Savas on the credits.\nImpressive. EGEE and the like are clearly not the place for\nAnubis-like synchronisation.\n\n-steve\n\n"}}
