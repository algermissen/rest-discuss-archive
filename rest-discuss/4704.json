AAA is handled here as in most web applications I know of via\n&gt; server sessions. I am not clear at all how to implement REST in a\n&gt; browser-based environment where the only way to keep client-side state\n&gt; is to stuff server-generated pages with state information on each\n&gt; request and return it in subsequent POSTs, which violates the\n&gt; &quot;separation of GET and POST&#39; commandment; either that or the GET urls\n&gt; are gonna get pretty big. Or am I missing something? \n\nI think the core of this confusion is: what is the resource? in an\ne-commerce app it seems like the resource is being decorated for each\nuser which is a REST no no.\n\nBut you could look at it another way. There are genuine datums called\ncustomer accounts. They contain certain information which must be\nviewable and editable.\n\nWe (perhaps) wouldn&#39;t blink if the accounts were viewed by a third\nparty like an accounts clerk. When they are viewed by the customer\nthemselves they sometimes get confused with session state.\n\nI think amazon&#39;s account stuff is an example of this confusion. It\ncould be clearer and more RESTfull by making explicit the idea of an account\nviewable by the person who own it.\n\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk\n\n"}}
