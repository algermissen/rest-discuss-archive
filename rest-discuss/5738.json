But I scoured the article looking for any mention of the\n&gt; schema -- how do the clients know the structure of the xml?\n\nThey just have to know it up front. The message type is where the  \nshared semantics are between client and server. E.g. your browser  \nknows that it can get that script code referenced by the &lt;script  \nlanguage=&quot;javascript&quot; src=&quot;...&quot;/&gt; element only becuase it knows the  \nsemantics of HTML.\n\n\n&gt; You could\n&gt; have a reference to a schema or DTD (or whatever) in your initial\n&gt; resource page, but I take it there is no standard way of doing this?\n&gt; Wouldn&#39;t this be a problem?  I must be missing something here...\n\nREST (well HTTP) offers the minimum needed to get the components to  \ntalk. And it enables them to find out *if* they can talk successfully  \n(Accept and Content-Type headers) or not.\n\nJan\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Please enlighten, if possible.\n&gt;\n&gt; --Kris\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
