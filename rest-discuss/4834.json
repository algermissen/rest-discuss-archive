Say you have a resource:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  some-uri-space/sub-space/xyz I would have another resource\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  (some-uri-space/edit/xyz) that would give me a editable\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  representation of the above resource.\n&gt; [...]\n&gt; &gt; I like it. Do you have corresponding URI spaces for delete, rename,\n&gt; and other operations?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; As interesting an approach as this may be, it is a Bad Idea [TM] to\n&gt; reify HTTP / WebDAV methods, such as DELETE and MOVE, within resource\n&gt; URIs. This fundamentally subverts the reason for having different HTTP\n&gt; methods in the first place...\n&gt;\nThese resources aren&#39;t modelling the methods, but I believe they are meant\nto access user interface artifacts related to the activity of deleting or\nmoving - like a confirmation page, or selecting a destination, etc. There\nare &#39;ui resources&#39; separate from the &#39;data resources&#39;.\n\n"}}
