On whom does the responsibility for avoiding that\n&gt; lie?\n\nThat&#39;s protecting the client.  I&#39;m talking about protecting the\nserver.\n\n&gt; The second problem is distinguishing this breakdown in &quot;safety&quot; from\n&gt; the case in which you use HTTP POST to send an arbitrary &quot;block of data ...\n&gt; to a handling process&quot;.  Or should we say a &quot;block of arguments to a\n&gt; remote handling procedure&quot;?\n\nHmm.  I&#39;m not sure that there&#39;s any distinguishing to be done in that\ncase.\n\n&gt; [example elided for brevity]\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This example achieves the squaring of 2 in a way that is quite\n&gt; &gt; &gt; different from the more obvious interpretations of &quot;state\n&gt; &gt; &gt; transfer&quot;.  Can we please discuss whether the above is &quot;RESTful&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and if not, what would it take to make it so?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s not RESTful, because &#39;square&#39; is an instruction to be \n&gt; &gt; followed, not\n&gt; &gt; data to be submitted.  In addition, this is a poor example because the\n&gt; &gt; client *expects* that squaring is done, which kind of begs \n&gt; &gt; the question\n&gt; &gt; as to why it can&#39;t do it itself and then PUT the result ... 8-O\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m glad to hear it&#39;s not RESTful.  That&#39;s a start.  (The reason\n&gt; the client doesn&#39;t square is because it doesn&#39;t know how to, kind of\n&gt; like why you don&#39;t do your own dental work, assuming you don&#39;t, but\n&gt; none of that is relevant now.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Okay, can you make it restful by changing the way you think about\n&gt; it?  For instance, can we call it a *record* of an action, or perhaps\n&gt; a short &#39;action document&#39;, or a &#39;delta representation&#39; of future\n&gt; resource state, or any other &#39;trick&#39; that gets us beyond this\n&gt; hitch?  What if we argue that it came straight from an HTTP form\n&gt; submission?\n&gt; \n&gt; Please anticipate where I&#39;m going with the above and help me find\n&gt; the boundary.\n\nI&#39;m not sure where you&#39;re going with it, sorry.  But with a clean slate,\nI&#39;d implement this using GET to return the squared value to the client,\ni.e.\n\nGET http://me.example.org/first-number\n\nwhich returns something like;\n\n5 &lt;a rel=&quot;http://math.example.org/squared&quot;\n   href=&quot;http://me.example.org/first-number?square=yes&gt;squared&lt;/a&gt;\n\nsuch that following the link identifies that you&#39;re traversing from a\nnumber to its square.  Then I&#39;d do a GET on that other URI, and then\nPUT the value back to /first-number - I think that&#39;s what your example\nwas doing, I&#39;m too lazy to go back and check. 8-)\n\n&gt; &gt; I think that &quot;Part-&gt;Composite&quot; is a tad more specific than HTTP\n&gt; &gt; suggests, but I might be picking nits.  It would seem to exclude the\n&gt; &gt; posting of data to a form processor, for example, since the\n&gt; &gt; composite relationship only exists for the duration of the processing.\n&gt; &gt; It doesn&#39;t persist like a StatePreservingContainer.  Pretty close\n&gt; &gt; though, but I prefer &quot;accept as a subordinate&quot; for describing the most\n&gt; &gt; generic form of containment as present in my RestRDF &quot;Container&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, I went back and read that section yet again (whew!), and while it\n&gt; does list as a goal the processing of form data, all the examples offered\n&gt; to clarify &#39;subordinate&#39; are clearly container (part/assembly) examples.\n&gt; I&#39;d say it looks inconsistent, with the &#39;forms&#39; stuff the odd-man-out.\n\nPerhaps, but that &quot;block of data&quot; blurb is the most oft referenced\npart of the definition of POST that people use to defend tunneling,\nala;\n\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/draft-debry-http-usepost-00.txt\n\nSo I think it&#39;s useful that the examples are part/assembly, even if\nthe IPP guys chose to ignore them. 8-)\n\n&gt; I think views can only adjust so far.  To me, POST is broken like\n&gt; a too-small pelvis trying to give birth to a cranial giant.  (Ouch. \n&gt; I&#39;ve got to stop ending these messages so vividly.)\n\nMy eyes, me eyes! 8-)\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
