For example, Content-alternatives could include &#39;application/rss+xml&#39; to indicate\nthe RSS feed. It could also return &#39;application/wsil+xml&#39;[1] or &#39;application/rsd+xml&#39;[2]\nto describe available web services (modulo some politically correct definition of &#39;web service&#39;).\nThis would allow multiple competing formats for web service and meta-data identification\nto be developed and deployed.\n\n[1] http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-wsilspec.html\n[2] http://archipelago.phrasewise.com/rsd\n\n\t-joe\n\n-- \nhttp://BitWorking.org\nhttp://WellFormedWeb.org\n\n\n"}}
