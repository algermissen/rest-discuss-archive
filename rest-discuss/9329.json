So if you can cheaply feed your whole spam\nlist into web forms, you do it.\n\nAlso, if you *can* get people to authenticate your web board (for\ninstance) account and it&#39;s permitted you to set your own password,\nthen you get to spam the web board.\n\nThe &quot;just because&quot; factor is surprisingly significant, too.\n\n"}}
