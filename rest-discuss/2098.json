My ignorance.  /Roger\n\nPhil Eskelin wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Roger,\n&gt; \n&gt; POST is not limited to name-value pairs.  If you look at RFC 2616 section\n&gt; 9.5 [1], you will see no mention of canonically-encoded name-value pairs as\n&gt; the only type of entity supported.  The type is determined by Content-Type.\n&gt; Most importantly, however, you will notice that the RFC defines POST as\n&gt; being used to:\n&gt; \n&gt;     &quot;...request that the origin server accept the entity\n&gt;      enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the\n&gt;      resource identified by the Request-URI in the\n&gt;      Request-Line&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; This is a key feature of the REST style.  POSTing to a subordinate of a\n&gt; known resource is an important feature, because it allows you to POST a\n&gt; representation without knowing what the resource at the origin server will\n&gt; do with it.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you didn&#39;t have POST, having only GET and PUT would overcomplicate the\n&gt; protocol.  Everyone would need to create their own way of perhaps using\n&gt; multiple GETs to discover the URI of a subordinate resource and use PUT to\n&gt; send their representation to it.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Philip\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.5\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Roger L. Costello [mailto:costello@...]\n&gt; Sent: Friday, August 16, 2002 9:24 AM\n&gt; To: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Cc: Costello,Roger L.\n&gt; Subject: [rest-discuss] No POST in an XML-based Web?\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Folks,\n&gt; \n&gt; My vision of the next generation of the Web is that all HTML document\n&gt; interchanges will be replaced by XML document interchanges.  Thus, the\n&gt; Web evolves from an HTML-based Web to an XML-based Web.\n&gt; \n&gt; In an XML-based Web I question the utility of the HTTP POST method.  The\n&gt; HTTP GET method allows a client to cleanly retrieve an XML document.\n&gt; The HTTP PUT method allows the client to cleanly send an XML document to\n&gt; the server.  The HTTP POST method, however, requires name/value pairs in\n&gt; the payload.  A client could submit an XML document using a name/value\n&gt; pair, where the value is an XML document.  However, that doesn&#39;t seem\n&gt; very clean.  In an XML-based Web I just want to exchange XML documents.\n&gt; The payload is clean - just an XML document.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would like to (boldly) assert that the name/value pair style is a\n&gt; remnant of HTML and is not suitable for an XML-based world!  Thus, I\n&gt; propose that in The New Web that HTTP POST be dropped.\n&gt; \n&gt; I know what you are thinking: &quot;Okay Roger, how do you do an update\n&gt; operation if you dump POST?&quot;  I am not sure.  Perhaps it is specified in\n&gt; the XML document itself?  Perhaps we need a new HTTP method for doing an\n&gt; update using an XML document?  Thoughts?  Comments?  /Roger\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
