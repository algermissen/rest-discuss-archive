Don&#39;t get me  \n&gt; &gt; wrong -- their REST-like API is a big improvement over their SOAP- \n&gt; &gt; style API, but I just don&#39;t consider it a paragon of REST.\n&gt; \n&gt; The non-SOAP API Amazon have was first described as REST as people \n&gt; discussing the REST vs. SOAP debate.\n&gt; \n&gt; One person even used a comment along the lines of &quot;Amazon, whether they \n&gt; know it or not, is going with REST&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is not REST, it&#39;s not even close, but it wasn&#39;t Amazon that first \n&gt; described it as such. As much as I hate abusing terms for marketing \n&gt; purposes, one can hardly blame them taking advantage when they found \n&gt; themselves caught up in hype of someone else&#39;s making.\n\nBut it is RESTful, at least in the case of data retrieval.  The fact\nthat the service *provider* threw an &quot;operation&quot; into the URI string\nmeans nothing to the consumer of that service; the semantics of that\noperation are entirely opaque to them and anybody else who uses that\nURI.  The only operation they know about is GET, and if they can use\nthat to get the data they want, all is good.\n\nWhat it isn&#39;t though, is a best practice, because it risks deviating\nfrom REST (in a Web context) in other ways, i.e. changing state on GET\n(which, IIRC, is done by the shopping cart API).\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
