It does \n&gt; not say\n&gt;  &gt; MUST.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, specs are harder to read these days because their authors must\n&gt; guard against abusive interpretations like this.\n\n+1\n\nThere is a group of people claiming that any normative statement in an \nIETF spec needs to use RFC2119 keywords. This is not true. Read RFC2119. \nKeep in mind that there are full internet standards such as RFC3986 \n(URI) which don&#39;t even use RFC2119 keywords at all.\n\nMy understanding is (and I&#39;m sure there&#39;ll be disagreement), that \nanything in a spec is normative unless stated otherwise (such as by \nlabeling it an example).\n\n&gt; ...\n&gt;  &gt; The statement that virtually all bets are off concerning the semantics of\n&gt;  &gt; PUT: &quot;HTTP/1.1 does not define how a PUT method affects the state of an\n&gt;  &gt; origin server.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s not what that sentence means. Read my first post in this\n&gt; thread, where I explain that servers can do anything they want and\n&gt; claim success (2xx). That is quite different from disputing the\n&gt; meaning of the message.\n\nBut I do agree that this sentence is causing lots of confusion, and that \nit is one of those things that RFC2616bis should improve.\n\n&gt;  &gt; Citing PATCH doesn&#39;t help, because PATCH was deprecated due to lack \n&gt; of use,\n&gt;  &gt; which could be read as evidence that merge semantics via PUT was good\n&gt;  &gt; enough.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s a fallacious argument. PATCH was deprecated because it wasn&#39;t\n&gt; implemented. Neither was PUT, tbh.\n\nI do agree it&#39;s a bad argument, but I&#39;ll have to say that PUT *is* \nwidely implemented.\n\nAFAICT, PATCH was removed because the transition from RFC2068 to RFC2616 \nmoved the specification from &quot;Proposed Standard&quot; to &quot;Draft Standard&quot;, \nand at that time, there wasn&#39;t enough data about PATCH being implemented \nas stated.\n\n&gt;  &gt; My conclusion is that the spec is ambiguous regarding PUT replacement vs.\n&gt;  &gt; merge semantics and there is no consensus in the relevant communities on\n&gt;  &gt; what the semantics should be.\n&gt; \n&gt; Your conclusion is wrong. My conclusion is that it takes quite a bit\n&gt; of cognitive dissonance to give a PUT message merge semantics. This is\n&gt; rest-discuss, where we like uniform interfaces. The one concrete\n&gt; example in this thread has shown that a PUT-merge works when you edit\n&gt; some Atom elements, but not others. Oops!\n\nAgreed. It seems that people are obsessed with the theory that the verbs \ndefined in RFC2616 must be sufficient for anything. Yes, they are, but \nonly if you use POST as fallback. Please don&#39;t start abusing PUT just \nbecause PATCH isn&#39;t there yet, and you don&#39;t like to use POST instead.\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
