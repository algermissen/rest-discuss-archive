Perhaps the page that is returned \nconsists mostly of &quot;includes&quot; and those includes are cached or not \ncached based on whether they are specific to you or not.\n\n&gt;&gt;No matter what device you were using, you would point the site at your\n&gt;&gt;consistent preferences-URI.\n&gt; \n&gt; The same URI for each device? This is what I would like, but in practice\n&gt; that doesn&#39;t happen all that often.\n\nNone of this happens in practice. It is a proposal. ;)\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; \n&gt; Wasn&#39;t there several attempts at this &#39;shared preferences&#39; approach? I can&#39;t\n&gt; find any references right now...\n\nNetscape had a remote preferences feature but I&#39;m not sure if it covered \ncookies. Hailstorm was to be more or less a remote cookie repository. \nBut they couldn&#39;t find a business model for it because the natural home \nfor it is at the ISP (or at least portal) and the biggest ISP in the \nworld would NEVER cooperate with Microsoft. Plus, ISPs seem to have \nfrozen the set of applications they are willing to deliver around 1995. \nHow many of them are working to roll out Jabber or multicast or smart \ncontent caching techniques or decent spam filtering or universal inboxes \n(=phone and email) or ...\n\nThey are about as imaginative as cable TV companies because these days \nthey _are_ cable TV companies.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
