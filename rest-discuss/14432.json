Bowman wrote:\n\n&gt; No, the presence of DELETE in an Allow: header informs the client that\n&gt; a DELETE is possible, but that is all.\n&gt; \n&gt; A self-documenting, hypertext-driven REST API may instruct the client\n&gt; to do a HEAD request on each URL appearing in a &lt;form&gt; listing\n&gt; deletable resources, and further instruct the client that it must\n&gt; perform a conditional DELETE (to avoid deleting a resource that someone\n&gt; else just altered, always consider time and multi-user).  If the Allow:\n&gt; header is implemented, the hypertext may instruct the client to exclude\n&gt; any resource from the deletable collection that didn&#39;t explicitly\n&gt; Allow: DELETE when the HEAD request was made.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, DELETE results in success or failure, however it&#39;s up to DELETE&#39;s\n&gt; implementation for a given resource to determine the failure mode...\n&gt; perhaps 401 to initiate challenge-response.  Informing the user as to\n&gt; why the DELETE failed differentiates the uniform REST interface from\n&gt; the generic HTTP interface.  Calling the DELETE method of a resource\n&gt; out-of-band of the hypertext application may even have caused the\n&gt; failure, as we shall see...\n&gt; \n&gt; (I haven&#39;t checked RFC 2616bis lately, but AFAIK the Allow: header may\n&gt; be sent with GET and HEAD requests, not just as part of a 405 response.)\n\nYes.\n\nBTW, &quot;Allow: DELETE&quot; in HTTP is a form of hypertext, as are all of\nthe resource metadata fields (data-embedded control information).\nThat is why they were considered part of the representation, though\nI think we are making Allow just a response-header in httpbis.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
