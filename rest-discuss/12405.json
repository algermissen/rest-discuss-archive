They totally respect HATEOAS and are a great example\n&gt; from what I&#39;ve seen so far.\n\nThey are RESTful, but about HATEOAS I&#39;m not sure. I may just be \nbetraying my ignorance here as I haven&#39;t even tried to follow the \ndiscussion. I formed my (mis-)understanding of HATEOAS mostly from \n(mis-)reading Richardson & Ruby&#39;s &quot;RESTful Web Services&quot;. There I got \nthe idea that HATEOAS implies something like &quot;affordances for machines&quot;, \nin other words, a client program (i) doesn&#39;t have to guess which states \nthere are to advance to from the current state and, once it has decided \nwhere to go, it (ii) doesn&#39;t have to tinker with bits and pieces of the \ntarget address to go there. A client program would be able to discern \npossible transitions from the resource representation itself, thus \nbecoming more resilient to changes.\n\nThe Sun Cloud APIs don&#39;t seem to follow this particular interpretation. \nAs far as I can tell, it consists of hierarchically related resources, \nwhich are delivered in such a way that lower-level resources are \nphysically contained within higher-level ones. I don&#39;t see how a client \nprogram would be able to do anything with this representation without a \ncomplete understanding of it. There would have to be built-in knowledge, \nthat Virtual Data Centers have addresses and clusters as sub-resources; \nand as representations of these sub-resources are simply contained in \nthe representation of the VDC, there is no linking, or hypermedia, \ninvolved. This way of modeling breaks for circular relations among \nresources, or if there are just too many to include or even link them \nindividually.\n\nAgain, I might be utterly confused about HATEOAS.\n\nMichael\n\n-- \nMichael Schuerig\nmailto:michael@...\nhttp://www.schuerig.de/michael/\n\n\n"}}
