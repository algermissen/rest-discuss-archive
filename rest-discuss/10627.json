I am a lecturer in the Athlone \nIns=\r\ntitute of Technology in Ireland. I am also doing a PhD. - Web \nservices has=\r\n caught my attention and REST in particular. \n\nThe reason I am writing to y=\r\nou all is that I am struggling to find \nthat &quot;angle&quot; in my PhD. I would lov=\r\ne to help in the propogation of REST \nbut am at a loss as to how my researc=\r\nh can help. \nMy superviser suggested either a) developing the concept furth=\r\ner or b) \nsolving issues with regard to REST and QoS e.g. reliability, secu=\r\nrity \nand transactions.\nMy understanding with regard to b) is that REST use=\r\ns https for security \nand Post Once Only for reliability. The area of relia=\r\nbility is \nattractive but I am open to ideas... \n\nThanks and regards,\nSean.=\r\n\n\n\n\n"}}
