Based on that I have chosen to create URLs without any user information in it.\n&gt; \n&gt; But the problem is that it still somehow should be possible to look at resources which are related to specific users or groups. So the question is if I for an instance need to see data related to user A should I do like this:\n&gt; \n&gt; /project/user/A/data or /project/data?user=&quot;A&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; What would you guys recommend, or do you have any relevant links?\n\nYou should use HTTP authentication and use the user information you then receive to send the representation that is applicable to the corresponding user.\n\nIf you have resources that only exist for that given user, I&#39;d use your former approach /project/user/A/data because it establishes a dedicated URI space per user.\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards Stefan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n-----------------------------------\nJan Algermissen, Consultant\nNORD Software Consulting\n\nMail: algermissen@...\nBlog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\nWork: http://www.nordsc.com/\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
