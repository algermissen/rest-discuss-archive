I&#39;ve been working on an interesting problem of late,\nthat I&#39;m not at liberty to share with the group.  Let&#39;s just say that\nit&#39;s as far away from government data as you can possibly imagine, yet\nthis w3c Note totally applies.  (With a wink and a nod to some lurkers.)\n\nI particularly like the term &quot;self-documenting&quot; when referring to the\nhypermedia itself; &quot;self-describing&quot; in REST refers to methods,\nresponse codes and headers in whatever protocol is used.  Lots of folks\nget tripped up when learning REST, into thinking that the entity is\nmeant to be self-describing.  If you&#39;ve properly applied the HEAS\nconstraint, your API isn&#39;t self-descriptive, it&#39;s self-documented.\n\nMy only criticism of the Note, is that the first step concerns itself\nwith URI design.  I prefer to start a REST project by identifying my\nresources as &quot;types&quot; and showing their relationships in a bubble chart;\nonly then do I proceed to designing the URI allocation scheme. Starting\nwith URI design as the Note recommends, often leads to mis-nested, or\nmissing, data hierarchies.\n\nThis is at odds with how REST&#39;s &quot;identification of resources&quot;\nconstraint should be applied, such that &quot;the forces that influence\nsystem behavior&quot; (like URI pattern) &quot;flow naturally, in harmony with\nthe system&quot;.  Sure, you can still hyperlink your way around this, but\nthe added complexity of such an approach falls short of the desired\nproperties a REST architecture is meant to evoke.  So make a bubble\nchart -- you can add new resources, sub-resources, and relationships as\nyou discover them, by adding new lines or bubbles.  I&#39;ve seen UML put\nto this use, too.\n\nI&#39;ve said before that there are no shortcuts to RESTful architecture.\nWell, there is one...  My criticism of REST-* remains unchanged.  A\ndisciplined approach to networked-software design is laid out by Roy&#39;s\nthesis: make yourself a tree diagram, applying and removing constraints\nas you go, to achieve the desired system properties. You may just\ndiscover that your problem is best solved by a C2 architecture -- which\nyou&#39;ll never know if you start by choosing an architectural style\nfirst, and then trying to shoehorn your solution into it.\n\nThe shortcut, is to prove that your solution resembles a distributed\nhypermedia application.  The precondition for applying REST&#39;s Uniform\nInterface and Layered System constraints is referred to as the &quot;client-\ncache-stateless-server&quot; constraint.  Any system built in accordance with\nthe advice given in this w3c Note will meet this precondition, proving\nthat it is indeed a distributed hypermedia application.  It says so\nright there in the Note -- such a system can be used as a RESTful API.\n\nWhat it doesn&#39;t say is, &quot;if and only if you&#39;ve applied the constraints\nmaking up REST&#39;s Uniform Interface&quot;.  So that&#39;s my REST shortcut:\nDevelop a distributed hypermedia application in accordance with the w3c\nPOGD Note.  *Then* ask how to &quot;make it RESTful&quot; by adding more\nconstraints to the existing set of client-cache-stateless-server\nconstraints you&#39;ve already shown to have applied by following the\nbest-practices advice in the Note.\n\n(The Note also makes no mention of caching, however, if it&#39;s followed\nthere&#39;s really no inherently-uncacheable data present.  Just turn on\nthe httpd&#39;s caching, if it isn&#39;t already.  So I&#39;m taking it as a given.)\n\nApologies to Dr. House... erm... Fielding if I&#39;ve oversimplified...  ;-)\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
