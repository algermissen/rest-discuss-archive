Today I would probably have c=\r\nhosen\nsomething like JSON-home (\nhttp://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingha=\r\nm-json-home-02), HAL or another\nhyper media enabled *standard* JSON media t=\r\nype.\n\nSo, no, I do not think using a service document / home page disqualif=\r\nies\nthe service as being RESTful - as long as it is used for late binding a=\r\nt\nruntime (something which we make quite explicit in the documentation).\n\n&gt;=\r\n albeit probably at the cost of a lot of initial tooling\n\nWell, yes, some, =\r\nbut any client that understands JSON can do hyper media\nwith something like=\r\n HAL.
