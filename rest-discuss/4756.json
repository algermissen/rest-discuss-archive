What do\n&gt; you mean by &#39;talk to distributed resources&#39;?\n\n    the premise behind all the REST discussions revolve around\ndealing with &quot;resources&quot; (which should be nouns) using a small \nset of methods (get, put, post, delete), instead of \nhap-hazard forms submitted to random cgi or servlets...( and I am\nto think of resources and not services...) \n\n    I then tried a pie-in-the-sky example:\n\n&gt; &gt;    build me a distributed set of resources (and a client-application\n&gt; &gt;that can query/integrate the results from each)   -- and then you&#39;re \n&gt; &gt;on to something...I want to send a book to my dad, so I type in part\n&gt; &gt;of the title -- ship that to a search-resource on Amazon, \n&gt; &gt;get the ISBN number, query my address-book for my dad&#39;s mailing\n&gt; &gt;address...push that to the Barnes and Noble web-site order \n&gt; &gt;resource...plug in my credit card number and BOOM \n&gt; &gt;-- sale pending.\n\n    If I scale-back the ambition -- I still see problems with \nusing the web-browser...the REST-process would be something like:\n\n   1.  GET the  B&N order resource http://www.bn.com/order\n     [ I get back a list of things I need -- say it provides an order number (say o99)  \n      (which I can use to PUT my result), I need a &quot;bill-to&quot; address,\n      a &quot;ship-to&quot; address, and a list of items I would like to purchase ]\n\n   2.  GET the B&N address resource http://www.bn.com/address\n      [ I get back a unique address ID number (say a10) (for when I PUT the resource)\n        and a list of things I need (address, city, state, zip-code...blah blah) ]\n\n   3.  PUT my bill-to address back to B&N   http://www.bn.com/address/a10\n      [ hopefully I get back a 201 (created) ... ]  (note -- I need to keep this\n        ID on my client (somewhere) to plug in when I PUT my order) ]\n\n   4.  GET the B&N address resource http://www.bn.com/address\n      [ to get my UID for the shipping address ... ( say a22 ) -- I need to keep \n        this ID somewhere on the client...for when I PUT my order ]\n\n   5.  GET the B&N catalog resource http://www.bn.com/catalog\n       [ and I&#39;ll assume there is some easy way to pick what I want ]\n\n   6.  [magically take the collection of resource-identifiers and build the\n         order form ]  then PUT http://www.bn.com/order/o10\n\n\nnow, keeping each of the Unique identifiers on the client between \ninteractions with each resource may be an issue using existing \nweb-browsers ( I suppose you could use cookies...) \n\nI suppose you could have a state-machine on the server\nthat walks the user through each if these steps -- but if you do\nthat I&#39;m not sure where the REST architecture is any better than \nbuilding a complicated &quot;POST&quot; form.\n\n--erik\n[disclaimer:  I am not affiliated with any of the multi-billion dollar \ncorporations which I use in my examples ]\n\n\n\n\n"}}
