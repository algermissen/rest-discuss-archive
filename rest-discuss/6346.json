Here is his blog \n&gt; &lt;http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000593.html&gt; , here is a (long) keynote \n&gt; &lt;http://blog.scribestudio.com/articles/2006/07/09/david-heinemeier-hansson-railsconf-2006-keynote-address&gt;  \n&gt; he delivered at RailsConf 2006 a few days ago.\n\nI wish the reference to REST was a bit more direct and clear. The term \nCRUD may be useful to help communicate the GET/POST/PUT/DELETE meaning, \nbut the mapping isn&#39;t a one-to-one unfortunately. In REST/HTTP, creation \ncan happen both after a POST and a PUT, so I&#39;m afraid that if people \nblindly apply CRUD to HTTP as proposed by David H. Hansson, this will \nbring some confusion. But, essentially, it&#39;s a step in the right \ndirection for Rails.\n\n&gt; For myself, I was tickled -- here I was working myself up to writing a \n&gt; RESTy framework, but now I just need to compose my soul for the roll-out.\n\n From what I&#39;ve seen in the blog post and the slides, I feel like there \nis still a lot of room for a fully RESTy framework... Have a look at \nwhat we are trying to do in Java at http://www.restlet.org\n\nThanks,\nJerome\n\n\n"}}
