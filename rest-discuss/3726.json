But it is demonstrably necessary \nto make URLs to things that behave differently for different people \n(whether different because of conneg, or language sniffing, or HTTP \nversion or username/password or ...)\n\n From a UI point of view it is important to be clear with the user about \nwhat the resource is.\n\nBut we&#39;re somewhat far afield of what the user asked. Can the system \ndeny access to other people&#39;s cities? The answer is clearly that REST \nallows this. Tyler&#39;s favorite security model may not, but REST has no \nproblem with it. The issue of whether the user sees their own cities at \na user-specific URL or user-generic URL is separate.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
