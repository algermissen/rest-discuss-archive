The client can&#39;t request it.  \n&gt; It\n&gt; &gt; just sends the data, and it&#39;s up to the container to do it, or not.\n&gt; \n&gt; I meant &quot;request&quot; in the sense of HTTP Request.\n&gt; (Not the everyday use of the word.)\n&gt; I thought HTTP was a Request-Response protocol.\n&gt; The URI for the new resource comes back on the Response.\n&gt; \n&gt; No?\n\nOk, but I took your use of the word to imply that there was something\nabout the HTTP request message that made the server think that this\nmessage was explicitly asking that a new resource be created.\n\n&gt; But I&#39;m happy to change the word.\n&gt; What would you say instead?\n\n&quot;Intent&quot; is the word that SOAP uses to describe SOAPAction.  I like it.\ni.e. &quot;this HTTP POST request is sent with the intent of archiving the\ndata&quot;.\n\n&gt; &gt; I suppose you could consider the use of SOAPAction with a URI\n&gt; &gt; identifying the expected type (in this case, a\n&gt; &gt; StatePreservingContainer), a &quot;request&quot;.  But I didn&#39;t get the \n&gt; impression\n&gt; &gt; that that&#39;s what you were suggesting.  If so, then you were right.\n&gt; \n&gt; No, I want to stay away from SOAP in these discussions as long as \n&gt; possible.\n\nOk, but this mechanism is needed in vanilla HTTP too, whether or not it\ncomes from SOAP.  Basically, a header that must be understood by the\nrecipient, otherwise the intent will be lost and communication will be\nunclear.\n\n&gt; &gt; No, it could be the name.  If you&#39;ve got any suggestions after this,\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m all ears.\n&gt; \n&gt; The feature we are discussing is the creation of a new resource in \n&gt; response to a POST, right?  &quot;IdentityPreserving&quot; sounds like it \n&gt; already has an identity, and the container is preserving it, whereas \n&gt; the server is creating the identity.\n\nRight.  Hence the change ..\n\n&gt;  How long the identity is \n&gt; preserved is another consideration; &quot;forever&quot; may not be needed.\n&gt; &quot;ResourceCreatingContainer&quot; would work for me, if that is the main \n&gt; distinguishing feature of this type.\n\nIt sort of is, but it&#39;s not that any old resource is created, it&#39;s that\none whose initial state is equivalent to what was POSTed is created.\nThat&#39;s what we need a good name for.  &quot;ResourceCreatingContainer&quot;\ndescribes the behaviour - resource creation - not the purpose of the\ncontainer.  I&#39;m not sure how that would be used.  Or to rephrase, the\ninteresting thing is not to know whether or not a resource is to be\ncreated, because you&#39;ll know that anyhow after the POST - the\ninteresting thing to know is *why* it will be created and what it\nmeans that it was.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
