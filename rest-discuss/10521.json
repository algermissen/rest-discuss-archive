Or did I\n&gt;  &gt; misunderstand you?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Actually, half-and-half: there&#39;s no reason not to use the Allow\n&gt; header, as far as I know, and Vary: Authentication to indicate that a\n&gt; different user may be allowed to use different methods. For your\n&gt; &quot;self-documenting&quot; idea, couldn&#39;t scripting could be used to read the\n&gt; Allow and Vary headers?\n\nI think that&#39;s based on a misunderstanding. The &quot;Allow&quot; header, and the \n405 response code, are *not* about what the current user is allowed to \ndo or not (that&#39;s why we also have 403 Forbidden), but what method names \nare allowed on a resource in general.\n\nYes, very misleading name.\n\n&gt; For what I suggested could go in an Accept response header, current\n&gt; practice is to use hypermedia, you have Atom Protocol on your side as\n&gt; well. So we do agree there, I&#39;m just wondering why Accept can&#39;t be a\n&gt; response header in 2616bis, nothing to do with your article. :-)\n\nThe set of allowed media types may vary by method name; it&#39;s not clear \nhow to deal with that...\n\n&gt; ...\n\nBR, Julian\n\n"}}
