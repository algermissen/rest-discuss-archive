In this case it is my contention that following the \n&gt; specifications leads to greater efficiency and greater \n&gt; profits. Companies so incompetent that they cannot manage a \n&gt; firewall or proxy server will be beaten by companies that \n&gt; can. Precisely because the market prefers competent, \n&gt; profitable, efficient companies, the pointy-haired will be weeded out.\n&gt; \n&gt; We&#39;re not advocating following the spec for the spec&#39;s sake. \n&gt; We&#39;re advocating following the spec because it works better \n&gt; than not following it.\n\nI generally agree with you in the long term, but not in the short term. The\nmarket won&#39;t reward many companies fast enough, so we have the chicken & egg\nproblem.  If they did reward them quickly, we&#39;d have no problem with people\nnot following standards, right?\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n&quot;It never ceases to amaze how many people will proactively debate away\nattempts to make the web more usable...&quot;\n\nP.S.
