I am arguing that when SOAP is\n&gt; used you POST to the SOAP server, and it then looks inside the SOAP\n&gt; message to determine which application to delegate to.  \n\nThe protocol can only suggest, not enforce, a dispatching strategy.\nStill, Sam Ruby and I discussed this issue a few weeks ago and we could\nnot come up with a simple, documented way (or at least a way that is\nsimply documented) to do dispatching to a logical resource in the\npopular SOAP toolkits out there. \n\n&gt;...\n&gt; My colleague argues that this is not true.  He says that a client can\n&gt; provide the URI directly to the target Web service (resource), for\n&gt; example:\n&gt; \n&gt;    http://www.parts-depot.com/parts\n&gt;    http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/part/00345\n&gt;    http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/purchase-order\n&gt; \n&gt; He claims that he has done this using WebLogic. Here&#39;s a quote from him:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We were able to have 2 web services on the same machines with different\n&gt; URI, using WebLogic.\n\nSure, that latter statement is absolutely true. You can have ten web\nservices at ten URIs if you want. But let&#39;s say someone adds a purchase\norder. Will WebLogic make it easy for software to accept SOAP POSTs to a\nnewly created URI? Or would it have to do something gross like tweaking\na configuration file or copying files around the file system. In other\nwords, do you have to trick it into supporting dynamically created\nobjects with new URIs or is it a native feature? SOAP won&#39;t stop you\nfrom being more intelligent than the average SOAP service but most SOAP\ntoolkits will make it difficult or impossible.\n\nAnd even if a single SOAP-based web service did the right thing, you\ndon&#39;t get the network effect if you are the only person who has figured\nout how to trick the tools into doing what you want.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
