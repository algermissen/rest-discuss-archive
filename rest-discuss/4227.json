It seems\nthat the two basic alternatives are:\n\n  1. Create a copy of the resource at a new transaction scoped URI\n\n  2. Access the transaction-scoped resource at its original URI via some transaction-id header.\n\nI believe that only the first is compliant with\nboth REST and HTTP.  You appear to disagree and\nbelieve that (a-c below):\n\n  a. requests with a particular transaction-id\n     header are more like con-neg than cookies.\n\nHow is it that transaction-id headers are\nconsistent with REST, but session cookies\ngenerally are not?  In either case the header has\nthe effect of taking the resource out of URI\nspace.  Would session cookies be RESTful if they\nwere all accompanied by a &quot;Vary: Cookie&quot; header?\nHow do I refer to a transaction scoped resource\nrather than the official version of the resource?\n\n  b. it is okay for GETs with these transaction-id\n     headers to have side-effects (subsequently causing\n     the transaction to fail if the resource is changed\n     before the transaction completes)\n     Note: I may be misinterpreting this claim.\n     You may have been arguing c...\n\nWhy is this particular GET side-effect consistent\nwith HTTP?  Or if you were actually arguing c....\n\n  c. the dependency of a request on the state of a\n     prior request can be handled with if-match\n\nHow do you if-match against URI&#39;s other than the\none you are modifying or is it simply unRESTful\nfor transactions to involve multiple resources?\n\n-Alex-\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nS.
