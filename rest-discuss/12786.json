If you use only \nthis expression it will make people think that &quot;having links&quot; is enough, \nwhen actually it&#39;s &quot;having links as a way to change application states&quot;. \nMaybe it sounds like a small difference, but &quot;having links&quot; suggest a \nstatic thing, while &quot;engine&quot; implies a dynamic thing. &quot;Having links&quot; \nstresses the role of the client, while &quot;engine&quot; stresses the fact that \nis the server, not the client, that is responsible for the application \nand the states available at any point. The client is only responsible \nfor choosing a path between the ones the server determines. And those \ncan be different any time the client  accesses one same resource if the \nserver (application) logic determines it.\n\nSo, basically, I think that talking about &quot;hipermedia&quot; without &quot;engine&quot; \nits very reducing and diminishing when explaining HATEAOS.\n\nBut the again, it&#39;s just my opinion... :)\n\n\n\nJim Webber wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Antonio,\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sincerely, I don&#39;t understand why the need to name things that are\n&gt; &gt; already named in a comprehensive way, specially taking into account\n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; it was Roy Fielding to use the expression, and I have to assume that\n&gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; knows what is talking about.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think Nick was just trying to humorously capture what he considered\n&gt; to be a useful way of thinking about HATEOAS. No renaming needed, it&#39;s\n&gt; already got the friendly name &quot;hypermedia constraint&quot; anyway.\n&gt;\n&gt; Nonetheless given that HATEOAS is the confusing bit from REST, any\n&gt; help we can offer in assisting other folks to understand it is a good\n&gt; thing. After all most people are still at the point in the REST\n&gt; learning curve where they think REST == nice URLs. (In fact not even\n&gt; nice URIs!).\n&gt;\n&gt; Jim\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
