I&#39;m using post for\nuploading 1..n files via an html form.)\n\n&gt;  If\n&gt; you want to put operation=query you can, but it is redundant with &#39;GET&#39;.\n\nI hadn&#39;t thought of it, but I did have get in mind. Total string length \nlimitations allowing I guess.\n\nAm I right in thinking you have gone beyond client and server,\nand are simply using software which takes advantage of the \nhttp protocol? \n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If I&#39;m right, is there any way of avoiding the password within this\n&gt; string?\n&gt; Definitely. The HTTP supports an extensible authentication mechanism -\n&gt; multiple styles of identifying the user are supported. Some are easier to\n&gt; program than others. For example, some use X.509 certificates which assumes\n&gt; a bunch of other systems are in place.\n\nI&#39;m happy to defer reading on that till I&#39;ve got my head round the lower\nlevel branches :-)\n\n\nThanks Mike.\n\n\n\n-- \nRegards DaveP.\nXSLT&Docbook  FAQ\nhttp://www.dpawson.co.uk/xsl\n\n\n\n"}}
