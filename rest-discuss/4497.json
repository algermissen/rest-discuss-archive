He has written\na lot of very nice software (Basecamp, Rails).\n\nInstiki uses hrefs and GET to do state changing\noperations.  As an example, here is some text from\nhttp://www.instiki.org/show/HomePage:\n\n&quot;\nSearch engines have traversed the site and have\nbeen �clicking� all the rollback links. So now\nthe rollback link is done in javascript to keep\nthose pesky engines at bay.\n&quot;\n\nWhen I read this I was wearing my RESTful hat so\nI immediately said &quot;he&#39;s using GET for the rollback\noperation; not very RESTful&quot;.  The javascript is a\nnice fix but ultimately doesn&#39;t address the underlying\narchitectural issue.  So I thought that maybe we on\nrest-discuss could have a go.\n\nI reckon a href should not be used here at all.\nLet&#39;s say we have a &lt;a onclick=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt; tag\ninstead of a &lt;a href=&quot;URL&quot;&gt; tag.\n\nThat javascript routine called from onclick (or\ntriggered by whatever UI gesture) could build a\nHTTP request and send it.  But that is just a\nSimple Matter of Code.  The real question is,\nwhat should this HTTP request look like?\n\nHere&#39;s mine, to get the ball rolling:\n\nPOST /somewikientry\n\nmethod=rollback\n\n"}}
