The cookbook would have to be a \n&gt; good cookbook. \n\nAgain, I was probably being too convenient.  The point is we need some\nauthoritative source to give guidance so we don&#39;t have a bunch of different\nself-appointed &quot;experts&quot; telling people conflicts stories about what is good\nREST.  We need a Pope, not a group of waring Mullahs.  \n\nAnd it doesn&#39;t have to be a cookbook, although cookbook a would be otherwise\nuseful too.  It could come from Roy, but I don&#39;t think he has interest in\nleading such an initiative.  So it needs to be a proxy for Roy, i.e. a small\ngroup of people he respects enough to entrust such authority and with whom\nthere is a line of communication so that he can give direction in unclear\ncases.\n\n&gt; The constraints necessary to be authoritative are counter to \n&gt; this; we need informative not normative descriptions here.\n\nYou are talking my description of &quot;authoritative&quot; far too literally (my\nfault for using the wrong term.)  I mean just we need some generally\nrespected source of information to cut down on &quot;the bullschildt.&quot; :)\n\n&gt; The only advantage I can see in being authoritative is that \n&gt; more people would by that book than any rival. Good for \n&gt; royalties, but not good for adoption.\n\nLots of books would be good.  Lots of books with comflicting descriptions of\ngood REST would be bad.  It&#39;s more about having something people can point\nto in order to end debate on topics that have already been resolved.\n\n&gt; I disagree here too, on three different points.\n&gt; \n&gt; Firstly, I read about an architectural style and came to the \n&gt; conclusion that it was good theory that was also proven in \n&gt; practice. I didn&#39;t drink any Kool-Aid. I have a great amount \n&gt; of respect for Roy, but I don&#39;t think we need his blessing \n&gt; for anything. \n\nI&#39;ve assumed that the whole community felt the need for his blessing based\non comments from some. If I&#39;m wrong, then no need for Roy after all I guess.\n\n\nSorry Roy. &#39;-)\n\n&gt; Devolving into chaos is preferable to descending into a \n&gt; personality-cult.\n\nNot that I don&#39;t necessarily agree with, assuming the personality is\nbenevolent. \n\nOTOH, have you heard of this thing called Ruby on Rails... &#39;-)\n\n&gt; Secondly, I think the only thing we *need* to do as a \n&gt; community is write good code. \n\nI respectfully say this is an idealistic view that misunderstands human\nnature.  A large percentage of the population want to just be told what to\ndo and how to do it, and for that they need a well known and well respected\nsource. And I&#39;m not being perjorative; I&#39;m a leader in some areas of life;\nin others I just want someone else to do the thinking and to be told what\nand how. We can&#39;t all be experts on all things, and that&#39;s where and why\nwell-known and well-respected sources play such a key role.\n\nAs a counter example, just look at the state of our mass media these days...\n;-)\n\n&gt; The only thing &quot;shepherding market maturation&quot; is likely to \n&gt; do is to develop a reputation for some of us. This is all \n&gt; good, but it&#39;s not important.\n\nSo what TimBL did for the web was not important?\n\n&gt; Thirdly, the term REST will get sullied if it&#39;s successful. \n&gt; It just will. \n\nCertainly, but it will get *more* sullied if it&#39;s widely misused than if it\nwidely used well.\n\n&gt; While I&#39;m making my posts way to long I&#39;ll also add that the \n&gt; best computing books are generally short.\n\nYes, and sadly unlike the comments on thread... :)\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org - http://t.oolicio.us\n\n\n"}}
