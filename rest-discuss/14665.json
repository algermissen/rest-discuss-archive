The list of all weekly summaries on http=\r\n://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?RESTWeekly. Every week on Monday, I (o=\r\nr someone else) will create a new page for that week and add it to the list=\r\n.\n2. The wiki page for this week is on http://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wik=\r\ni.pl?RESTWeekly_Jan_25_2010\n\nSo, if we find anything REST-related worth rea=\r\nding - just add a link to the wiki page and I&#39;ll post the links to this gro=\r\nup when the week is over, and perhaps create a blog for feed-based distribu=\r\ntion.\n\nCheers!\nIvan\n\n\n"}}
