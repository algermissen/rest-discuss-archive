The first approach enables things like \nGoogle to exist and the latter prevents them.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; If both approaches have a dependency on exactly the same information then\n&gt; the coupling is exactly the same.\n\nBut they don&#39;t. See above.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; If the resources have nearly infinite granularity then the lookup table will\n&gt; hang the client and avoiding a hyperlinking approach is also required.\n&gt; Looks like we are stuck. Can&#39;t get there from here.\n\nAs the question was originally posed, there was per-day granularity.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; A list does not say the second part. If it did, then the list would have to\n&gt; be a full and not partial list. Which isn&#39;t scalable in my opinion - very\n&gt; large data sets would choke even the copious bandwidth we have today.\n\nPaul says:\n\n &gt; Sometimes the information provider has such a large database of\n &gt; information that it is not practically (or economically) feasible for it\n &gt; to deliver to the requestor in total or even to segment into many\n &gt; hypermedia documents. The requestor needs to specify some reasonable\n &gt; filter. This is a fallback position because it becomes difficult or\n &gt; impossible for the requestor to enumerate all of the information items\n &gt; even if this might be useful or important. Nevertheless, reality\n &gt; requires that sometimes filtering happen on the server side and the\n &gt; Web allows this through HTTP URI &quot;query parameters&quot;.\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/2540\n\n &gt; ...\n&gt; Earlier you said that the algorithmic approach would need to know the\n&gt; constraints (boundary, past/future, etc.) Since this is extra information\n&gt; that is provided to the client, isn&#39;t this an example of what you consider\n&gt; &#39;loosened coupling&#39;?\n\nProviding extra information at runtime loosens coupling by making the \nservice more discoverable for clients that were not designed \nspecifically to work with the data. Providing extra information at \ndesign time makes it easier to use the service but doesn&#39;t loosen \ncoupling. If you have a way of presenting the boundary information at \nruntime, in a way that can be handled by a domain-insensitive client \nlike Google, then sure, throw it in. But I don&#39;t really have such a \ndescription language available.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; Sounds like you are advocating retrieving a (possibly very large) lookup\n&gt; table and doing local queries. \n\nI think you need to choose between the approach of having the server do \nthe filtering or having the client doing the filtering based on a \nvariety of factors including size of data sets and extent to which the \nclient is under your control. If the data size is reasonable and the \nclient is NOT under your control then the list-version is strongly \nsuperior to the query version. In other parts of the quadrant you might \nwant to pair the list version WITH the query version (and let the client \nchoose the most appropriate for them)\n\n\n&gt; ... The &#39;filter to certain dates&#39; is an operation\n&gt; upon that local data - and that filter would need the same input data as a\n&gt; client-composed URI (namely &#39;asof&#39; and the date\n&gt; syntax/value-space/meaning/whatever).\n\nBut\n\n  a) the filter allows subtyping and remapping so that can be extended \nin a purely declarative way to handle sites that rename their &quot;asof&quot; to \n&quot;asofdate&quot;. If those sites publish the renaming as RDF, I won&#39;t have to \ntouch my client application to have it work with this new data \nrepresentation.\n\n  b) the filter knows the complete scope of the information available to \nit. That&#39;s &quot;extra information&quot; that you don&#39;t get when all you can do is \nguess and query.\n\n&gt;&gt;But anyhow, the part I could do in N3 is: &quot;Start with this URI which is\n&gt;&gt;a list of &#39;date-versioned resources&#39;. By definition each one has a date.\n&gt;&gt;Get the ones that are less than 5 days old (some hand waving around date\n&gt;&gt;functions here...).\n&gt; \n&gt; I think I&#39;m beginning to glimpse what you are getting at. The same\n&gt; information (&#39;asof&#39; and dates) is used to crawl local content (retrieved\n&gt; from a generic uri), rather than to directly address a remote resource... is\n&gt; that correct?\n\nI don&#39;t think of it as local versus remote. I think of it as having an \nagent filter the information based on declarative expressions (probably \nlocally, for implementation reasons) versus having a black box with a \npredefined query and no way to get information that is not available \nthrough that query (like &quot;how often did this information change&quot;). The \ncontent is not local in the sense that I don&#39;t do a big recursive &quot;wget&quot; \nbefore I start applying the filter. Rather I point the filter at a URI \nand it gets what it needs and hopefully never bothers to download things \nthat are obviously NOT what it needs. (which suggests that you want to \ncarefully consider the design of the index document)\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; The same re-application probably would not work with composed URIs out of\n&gt; the box. But if you&#39;ve got content-manipulation approaches (arch forms, name\n&gt; mapping, etc.) executed on the client, then I supposed that same slot could\n&gt; be filled with mappings of the declarative rules for generating URIs also.\n\nMaybe. Nevertheless, if the resource you provide are enumerable then a \nlegitimate question for a client application to ask is &quot;how do I \nenumerate them.&quot; You can&#39;t predict whether this will be important to \nsome client or not. So I advise that if the resources are enumerable and \nif you have the development where-with-all, you should expose an \ninterface that allows enumeration perhaps alongside one that allows \nqueries as an optimization.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
