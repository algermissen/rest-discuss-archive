Defining a subset of all possible URI\nmanipulation along with rules doesn&#39;t sound like &#39;floodgates&#39;. Clarifying\nexisting practice and extending that to other declarative forms sounds like\nit will strengthen the Web, not weaken it.\nJeffB consistently says that it is only one of many tools and can/should be\nused only in certain classes of problems, and he says that otherwise a pure\nhyperlink approach is better.\n\nhttp://conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/GenerativeNaming\n&quot;It&#39;s not good for characterizing sparse or irregular information spaces.\nAnd generally, they are no substitute for hypertext unless the abstraction\nbeing represented just cannot be efficiently represented in hypertext&quot;\n\n&quot;The bottom line is that names and graphs are different tools that are\n*both* fundamental components of the Web architecture, and you should use\nthe right tool for the job&quot;\n\nTake the example of 100K user profiles, indexed by email address. JeffB &\nPaulP - show me each of your approaches. More than one example is fine,\nsince that helps explain things to me.\n\n"}}
