The original site would need to check availability\n&gt; and respond back to the buyer with problems, which could also cause\n&gt; race conditions and vicious circles.  Not a pretty picture.\n\nWhy don&#39;t the farmers tell the central site that they have 100 pints of strawberries and let the central site deal with the stock management?\n\nJan\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there a RESTful way to handle this situation?\n&gt; \n&gt; Something vaguely like this, but on steroids?\n&gt; http://wiki.activitystrea.ms/Actions\n&gt; http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/Action_Links\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
