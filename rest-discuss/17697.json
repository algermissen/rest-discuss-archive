These associations\n&gt; are not visible=\r\n in representations as a result of a leaky abstraction,\n&gt; nor is the abilit=\r\ny to modify relationships.  Allowing clients to\n&gt; accomplish resource relat=\r\nionship modification using the fundamental\n&gt; abstractions of REST style arc=\r\nhitectures is appropriate.\n\nMy comment is really around how one can accompl=\r\nish that; resource relationship modification. There are many ways that clie=\r\nnts can accomplish resource relationship modification; however passing uri&#39;=\r\ns around from the client may not be the best approach in my opinion. I can =\r\nget how the service establishes resource relationships via hypermedia, but =\r\nI don&#39;t understand how the client and do the same. For one the representati=\r\non of the Uri itself is in question because the client assumes the media ty=\r\npe, as conneg is not really an option. Secondly the server needs to infer t=\r\nhe target of the relationship represented by the uri, which seems odd to me=\r\n. Could you give a concrete example of how that could be done?\n\n&gt; Certainly=\r\n there a many situations where using URIs is not necessary.\n&gt; However, if y=\r\nou ever try to integrate two or more systems you quickly\n&gt; realize that URI=\r\ns are the only way to identify resources that live in\n&gt; other systems.  \n\nT=\r\nhat is true=85 but how does the service make sense of the uri? it becomes e=\r\nven more difficult in the case of two or more systems. \n\n&gt; One should *not*=\r\n be constructing resource identities on the client\n&gt; side.  Clients should =\r\nuse URIs that are well known, or that have been\n&gt; seen in the representatio=\r\nns of other resources.\n\n+1 but it makes the system brittle if the uri space=\r\n changes.\n\n&gt;  If the client needs\n&gt; to associate resource A with resource B=\r\n, following the hypermedia\n&gt; instructions in some representation is a very =\r\nnatural way to\n&gt; accomplish that.  For example, the client might &quot;see&quot; the =\r\nappropriate\n&gt; relationship `form` in B&#39;s representation, populate A&#39;s URI i=\r\nn the\n&gt; appropriate `input` in that form, and then submit the form.\n\nIs tha=\r\nt good form to do stuff like that? It doesn&#39;t feel right to me.\n\nRegards\nDi=\r\nlip Krishnan\n"}}
