However, if \nI have marked the 410 response explicitly with a no-cache directive I \nwould indeed consider that an error, just as I would consider it to \nbe an error if a client cached a 404 response.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Additionally, if a HEAD returns 410, why should a software client be\n&gt;expected to believe that a DELETE might have any meaningful effect on\n&gt;that resource?\n&gt;\n\nGood point, unless the 410 is marked no-cache.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
