Given that, why have WADL?\n\n\nThis is an interesting point. I considered what I wrote above and\nthought &quot;why not just have multiple WADLs?&quot;\n\nBut the trouble is then you&#39;re constraining people to think about the\nwhole contiguous webapp. Not just small pieces. \n\nREST on HTTP (without WADL) describes only each resource and the\nconnections between immediate resources.\n\nWADL describes whole webservices.\n\n\nI have to reiterate. I don&#39;t believe WADL to be evil. I just think it\nshould be possible to write something that just uses what&#39;s in HTTP\n(and it has to be there anyway).\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
