It \n&gt; makes no sense to me. The only benefit I can think of is that \n&gt; intermediaries have some insight into what is going on. From a practical \n&gt; perspective this means you get caching (yes, theoretically it can be \n&gt; more than caching but most systems stop there).

What are the benefits of a REST - HATEOAS based \n&gt; architecture?\n\nEach principle and constraint adopted gets you some benefit, and those \nare well documented. So the answer seems to the benefits except those \nderived from links in content.\nBill\n\n"}}
