Or should the server accept messages with unwanted URLs and\n&gt; &gt; fields and simply toss them away?\n&gt;\n&gt; How about using different content types for the representations with\n&gt; and without the URLs that you want to have created by the server?\nErmm, maybe.  Seems awkward, though.\n&gt; In any case, I believe the PUT restriction is in fact not that\n&gt; strict. At least the HTTP spec doesn&#39;t define that what has been PUT\n&gt; must be exactly what&#39;s retrieved by a subsequent GET (unless I&#39;m\n&gt; missing something).\nAbsolutely true.  But it&#39;s a good best practice.  Especially for generic \nclients which can retrieve the contents of any URL, present it for \nediting, and allow for it to be posted back.  I&#39;d rather not give it up \nunless I have to.\n\n"}}
