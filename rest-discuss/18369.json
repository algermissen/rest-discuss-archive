View sourceness?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; No. It&#39;s key because those semantics are really being broadcast to\n&gt;&gt; humans (developers writing the consuming agents&#39; logic).\n&gt;\n&gt; No, theye&#39;re not, an ontology is designed so that C2C works seamlessly. As\n&gt; long as humans who create programs know how to deal with certain entities or\n&gt; given relationships, the rest of the nitty-gritty of business processes do\n&gt; not need any human intervention\n\nI don&#39;t think we can step over &quot;certain entities or given\nrelationships&quot; just like that..\n\nWhat are the nitty-gritty of business processes in a hypertext\napplication if they&#39;re _not_ the entities and relationships? Surely,\nthe semantics of entities and their relationships _are_ the\napplication?\n\n&gt;&gt; If I produce\n&gt;&gt; an hypertext application and expose its semantics as an &#39;ontology&#39;,\n&gt;&gt; those semantics will be consumed by developers first and foremost in\n&gt;&gt; order to develop their understanding of the way the application flows.\n&gt;\n&gt; No, not necessarily, and this is key to the whole semantic schmantic web;\n&gt; understand a basic part of the ontology (so, the parts that touch the edges\n&gt; of its API) to avoid needing to know the whole.\n\nAre there any practical examples of applications that actually work\nthis way? Can any of them be easily comprehended and coded against by\naverage devs (i.e. devs that aren&#39;t semweb Zen-masters)?\n\n&gt; Derived ontologies infer\n&gt; from context their applicability, and one can map objects and relationships\n&gt; to workflows more easily than you can use a traditional API.\n&gt;\n&gt; Example; My app and your app both speak a small ontology about business\n&gt; interaction (basic entities, for example). These apps are obviously made by\n&gt; developers, but here&#39;s the clinch; if you speak that ontology, those maps of\n&gt; your data you&#39;ve got can be directly reused in more complex frameworks where\n&gt; underlying ontologies are derived from the basic ontology. An objects type\n&gt; follows through the ontology, where relationships are specified and can be\n&gt; acted upon. It basically means that objects that you&#39;ve defined as type X\n&gt; can be popped into other systems, and interaction can happen, without any\n&gt; further devs involved.\n&gt;\n&gt; More specifically, there&#39;s ontologies for working with semantics within\n&gt; maps, and some apps can enrich your data without any devs. It enables the\n&gt; creation of evolving ontologies for your applications domain and scope.\n&gt;\n\nI agree that the potential for re-using/re-mixing code written against\napplications is improved by defining the application in terms of link\nrelations (vs. domain specific media types). That is one of the key\nreasons I prefer generic media types, so we definitely agree on that.\nHowever, I don&#39;t follow your logic about this re-use somehow\novercoming a need for human interaction; since the applications and\ncode being re-used had to be created by /people/ expressing (author\ndev) and comprehending (consumer dev) the semantics in the first\nplace.\n\n&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t think it needs to get more complex than that, and I&#39;m not 100%\n&gt;&gt; on whether that lack of complexity fails to satisfy the definition of\n&gt;&gt; an &quot;ontology&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Ontology is the language you use; the entities you&#39;ve got, their types, and\n&gt; the relationships between them. You can make that as complex or simple as\n&gt; you need, but of course even more subscribe to reuse of models.\n\nThat being the case, where does that leave us wrt your previous\nstatement: &quot;As long as humans who create programs know how to deal\nwith certain entities or given relationships, the rest of the\nnitty-gritty of business processes do not need any human\nintervention&quot;?\n\nI think you are over-stating the importance of machines wrt the actual\napplications - perhaps this is a general semweb thing?\n\nI find it easiest to think about hypertext applications in terms of\n&#39;agent intent&#39;. The job of application semantics are to instruct\nagents how their intent should translate into interactions with a\nserver.  In the case of machine agents - their intent is actually the\ncodified intent of their developers, so the semantics should speak to\nthose developer(s) since they are the ones performing the translation\ninto the codified interactions the machine agent is performing.\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; It has a defined use in information technology, so get used to it. :)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As an application author my concern would be that presenting my\n&gt;&gt; application to client developers as an &#39;ontology&#39; would either confuse\n&gt;&gt; them or scare them off completely. But, like I said, I don&#39;t think the\n&gt;&gt; word we use matters /that/ much.\n&gt;\n&gt; Call it vocabulary, and relationships. If client developers don&#39;t get this,\n&gt; I suggest you need better clients. :)\n&gt;\n\nIs it ok if I use &quot;representations&quot; and &quot;link relations&quot; instead?\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n"}}
