If the client knows the\n&gt; desired state of the trade, then PUT is the correct method.\n\nThe client is receiving confirmations of trades from an exchange, and \nneeds to programmatically enter them in our system.\n\nThe trade may need modification because of a mistake; effectively the \nclient wants to store a complete new version of the trade, hence the \nuse of PUT (though old versions are retained, so perhaps POST more \nrelevant?).\n\nThis brings up an interesting point: probably clients would like to \nbe able to access old versions of a trade. What would be a good way \nof doing this? Ideas:\n\n1) To get the latest version:\n-&gt; HTTP GET //host/trades/122\nreturns latest version of the trade XML e.g.\n&lt;trade id=&quot;122&quot; version=&quot;5&quot;&gt;\n...\nMaybe links to the older versions could also be provided in the \nlatest version?\n\n2) To get an older version\n-&gt; HTTP GET //host/trades/122?version=2\n   or\n-&gt; HTTP GET //host/trades/122/2\nreturns the trade XML for the second version.\nVersions are a history of the resource&#39;s state. Which is preferred, \nusing a query based off the existing URI or a new URI?\n\n\nThanks,\nRobert McKinnon\n\n\n\n"}}
