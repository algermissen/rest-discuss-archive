It sugges=\r\nts that hypermedia, e.g., the set of\n&gt; HTML documents exchanged among a use=\r\nr agent and a set of servers, IS the\n&gt; engine.\n\n&gt; Hypermedia is NOT the eng=\r\nine, the user agent is the engine.\n\nFunny enough, that is very similar to m=\r\ny interpretation (or my\nintuition, perhaps). I never though of the &quot;hiperme=\r\ndia&quot; as *being* the\nengine, for me &quot;hipermedia engine&quot; is what I&#39;ll call to=\r\n a engine that\nuses hipermedia for it&#39;s intents, in this case drive a appli=\r\ncation\nfrom state to state. Like, let&#39;s say a &quot;electrical motor&quot; is a motor=\r\n\nthat uses electricity to performs it&#39;s function, moving a car for\nexample.=\r\n It&#39;s not the electricity that *is* the motor.\n\nThe only difference from yo=\r\nur last phrase to what I think, is that for\nme &quot;the server is the engine&quot;. =\r\nI say this because, although is the\nclient that really &quot;drives&quot; the state t=\r\nransitions, by choosing one of\nthe alternatives presented to him, is really=\r\n the server that allows or\ndisallows the possible transitions.\n\nI will say =\r\nthat the client drives the state transitions, but the\nserver drives the cli=\r\nent (into what transitions he can follow). So in\nthe end is the server that=\r\n takes care of all the state transitions\navailable in a application.\n\nNever=\r\ntheless, I will not argue about this point, who drives who,\nbecause I think=\r\n it&#39;s almost just a question of &quot;flavour&quot;, doesn&#39;t have\na impact in the ove=\r\nrall question.\n\nI think that by seeing this &quot;hipermedia engine&quot; in the anal=\r\nogy with\n&quot;electrical motor&quot;, the phrase I quoted from Roy Fielding is clear=\r\n\nenough to explain HATEOAS to people that has any kind of development\nbackg=\r\nround.\n\n&quot;all application state transitions must be driven by client selecti=\r\non\nof server-provided choices that are present in the received\nrepresentati=\r\nons&quot;\n\nThe other attempts that we&#39;ve been talking, &quot;Hypermedia describes\npro=\r\ntocols&quot;/&quot;Hypermedia constrains protocols&quot;, from my point of view\n(and nothi=\r\nng more than that) are erroneous in putting emphasis in the\n&quot;hipermedia&quot; an=\r\nd &quot;protocols&quot;, that are simple the means used by the\nserver and the client =\r\nto drive the application state transitions.\n\nEven more if we take into acco=\r\nunt observations like this:\n\n&quot;A REST API should not be dependent on any sin=\r\ngle communication\nprotocol, though its successful mapping to a given protoc=\r\nol may be\ndependent on the availability of metadata, choice of methods, etc=\r\n.&quot;\n\n*should not be dependent on any single communication protocol* and we\np=\r\nut the emphasis on how &quot;hipermedia&quot; describes or constrains the\n&quot;protocol&quot;?=\r\n When the API should not depend on it? Each protocol is\ndifferent, so why w=\r\nould eventually what be true for HTTP be also true\nfor other protocols?\n\nI =\r\nwould cite again Roy Fielding, with my own addenda:\n\n&quot;it doesn=92t help the=\r\n situation by renaming the hypertext engine as\n{&quot;Hypermedia describes proto=\r\ncols&quot;, &quot;Hypermedia constrains protocols&quot;,\n&quot;connectedness&quot;. That does nothin=\r\ng but obscure its role as the driving\nforce in RESTful applications.&quot;\n\nI th=\r\nink, for the sake of simplification and clarification, that the\nway Roy Fie=\r\nlding describes it, *hypertext engine* is, let&#39;s say,\nsimple and clear enou=\r\ngh, taken &quot;hypertext engine&quot; as the engine that\nuses hipertext to drive app=\r\nlication state transitions, as in\n&quot;electrical motor&quot; as the engine that use=\r\ns electricity to move my car\nto drive me to work every morning, when I trad=\r\ne my gas car by a\nelectrical, of course (btw, is the car who drives me or i=\r\ns I that\ndrive the car?).\n\nNow, again, this is the way I see it, nothing mo=\r\nre than that, and I\ndon&#39;t want to piss anyone with my positions, but someti=\r\nmes I get the\nfeeling that people are only looking for support for their po=\r\nsitions\nand tend to dismiss opinions otherwise.\n\nBut then again opinions te=\r\nnd to be like that, each one has it&#39;s own...\nNo harm done here, I think...\n=\r\n\n"}}
