(WAS: what is state?)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Mark Baker wrote,\n&gt; &gt; If the data being transferred cannot be described as a \n&gt; representation\n&gt; &gt; of some (perhaps unnamed) resource, then you&#39;re not doing it right.\n&gt; \n&gt; If resources can be nameless then we can&#39;t define &quot;resource&quot; \n&gt; primarily \n&gt; in terms of URIs ... ie. we can&#39;t say,\n&gt; \n&gt;   X is a resource if and only if X is identified by some URI\n\nAgreed that you can&#39;t say that.  But you might be able to say that\n&quot;X is a resource if and only if X *could be* identified by some\nURI&quot;.  This is pretty broad, granted, but it&#39;s not quite vacuous.\nFor instance, &quot;walking down the road&quot; seems to me like something\nthat fails the predicate above.  Although there are extreme cases\nthat almost break the rule, remember that the purpose for a\nresource to exist is to have state that we can communicate about.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I think that raises several interesting questions,\n&gt; \n&gt; * Unnamed resources do away with the &quot;only if&quot;, but is this a step in\n&gt;   the direction of doing away with the &quot;if&quot; too ... ie. if we can have\n&gt;   unnamed resources, why can&#39;t we also have names with no \n&gt; resource? eg.\n&gt;   http://www.example.com/nothing-here-folks.\n\nIt&#39;s a funny property of namings that they always seem to bind to\nsome state.  Given that REST resources are conceptual, it&#39;s hard\nto imagine naming something that can&#39;t be a resource.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; * If having a URI isn&#39;t the criterion of resource-hood, then \n&gt; what is? Is \n&gt;   &quot;resource&quot; just an RFC 2396 compliant way of saying &quot;thing&quot;?\n\nIt says more than just &quot;thing&quot;; it says &quot;thing with meaning&quot;, and\nmoreover, it says &quot;thing with meaning that we can talk about all\nday long and never change or directly touch the meaning itself&quot;.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; * In the context of the discussions on the TAG list, is a URI-less\n&gt;   resource &quot;part of the Web&quot;?\n\nI&#39;d say if it&#39;s not connected, it&#39;s not part of the Web, and if\nthe URI is the only way to connect it, then ....\n\n&gt; \n&gt; * How, if at all, do the kind of unamed resources that Mark&#39;s talking\n&gt;   about here relate to RDFs anonymous nodes?\n\nDunno!\n\nWalden Mathews\n\n\n"}}
