A CCXML client makes HTTP requests for CC=\r\nXML pages that run on a platform that controls client-side resources. Many =\r\npeople write static CCXML pages, but that doesn&#39;t make it any less of a rep=\r\nresentation language -- each page still has a URI. CCXML is NOT used to gen=\r\nerate VoiceXML or any other markup language (not in any system I&#39;ve seen). =\r\nI&#39;m puzzled as to why you&#39;d have this view. Can you point me to a system wh=\r\nere CCXML is used like PHP?\nRegards,\n\nAndrew\n\n\n\n"}}
