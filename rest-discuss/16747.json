That is why I also include things like &quot;file based integration&quot;).\n\n\nHere is my list:\n\n\n- File based integration (coordination of processes using the file system)\n- Database based integration (coordination of processes using an RDBMS\n- Message Queues\n- RPC (I am equating all forms of it: RMI, DCOM, Corba, WS-*, URI tunneling. Makes sense?[1])\n- PubSub\n- HTTP Type I ( HTTP with design time WADL or similar and generic media types)\n- HTTP Type II ( HTTP with design time WADL or similar and specific media types)\n- REST\n\nAnything else?\n\n\nJan\n\n\n[1] Meaning: do they all have the same coupling effect? I guess one could consider RMI to couple more than WS-* because it also couples on the Language used.\n\n"}}
