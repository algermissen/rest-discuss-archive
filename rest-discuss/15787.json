This raises the question, can I have ACD and =\r\nbe RESTful? If I relax C to eventual consistency (E), I think I see how I c=\r\nan have AED in a RESTful setting by submitting batch requests, persisting t=\r\nhem on arrival, and using guaranteed delivery to all affected servers.\n&gt;\n\nI=\r\nn this case, as with a lot of your other concerns, I think the best\nway to =\r\ngo is to understand the REST constraints, what benefits they\nprovide, and w=\r\nhat you lose for each REST constraint that you relax or\nviolate.  It&#39;s not =\r\nlike you&#39;ll go to jail, you just might not be able\nto call it RESTful - and=\r\n you still may benefit from the constraints\nyou uphold.\n\nHowever, some fact=\r\ns of life on the Web hold regardless of REST.  For\nexample, you won&#39;t get I=\r\nsolation across independent agents because no\nsmart counterparty will hold =\r\nlocks while your agent can die and never\ncome back.  And Atomicity is likel=\r\ny to be compromised, too, so you\nmight as well adapt to it.\n\n"}}
