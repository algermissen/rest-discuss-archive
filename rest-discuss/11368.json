How should I link to other resources and others\nrepresentations of =\r\nthe resource itself? Atom uses the &lt;link&gt; element,\nwhich is very extensible=\r\n. But that&#39;s its problem, if I am designing a\ndomain specific vocab, why sh=\r\nould I try to be generic? Consider a\nclient resource. Which may have a coll=\r\nection of orders associated with\nit. If I were to point to a resource conta=\r\nining the client&#39;s orders, I\ncould use &lt;link&gt; as follows:\n\n&lt;link rel=3D&quot;ord=\r\ners&quot; type=3D&quot;text/xml&quot; href=3D&quot;/api/client/123/orders.xml&quot; /&gt;\n\nThe problem =\r\nI have with that is unnecessary complexity. I&#39;m using a\nconstruct that is c=\r\nlearly intended to be used in broad, extensible\ncontext in a domain specifi=\r\nc API that is supposed to be set in stone.\nI&#39;m inclined to just use the fol=\r\nlowing:\n\n&lt;client ref=3D&quot;/api/clients/123&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;orders ref=3D&quot;/api/clients/12=\r\n3/orders.xml&quot; type=3D&quot;application/xml&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;orders ref=3D&quot;/api/clients/123=\r\n/orders.json&quot; type=3D&quot;application/json&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/client&gt;\n\nI could definitely fi=\r\nnd a way to wrap the API in Atom (since\neverything are basically collection=\r\ns), and in this case of course I\nwould use &lt;link&gt;. But if I&#39;m defining my o=\r\nwn domain specific API, from\nan engineering point of view, should I care wi=\r\nth keeping consistency\nwith Atom/HTML on &lt;link&gt; and potentially also attrib=\r\nute names (ref vs\nhref)?\n\nI have come up with two postulates for API design=\r\n, so whenever I would\nrun into the same type of situation, I would these cr=\r\niteria to guide\nmyself:\n\n1) Every referred resource within another resource=\r\n&#39;s representation\nneeds a @ref attribute pointing to its canonical represen=\r\ntation\n(usually XML), even if it is an empty element, and also a @type\nattr=\r\nibute. Example:\n\n&lt;other-resource ref=3D&quot;{uri}&quot; type=3D&quot;application/xml&quot; /&gt;\n=\r\n\n2) Every URI pointing to an alternative representation of the current\nreso=\r\nurce should be kept as text element children. Naming of the\nelement for the=\r\n alternative representation is up to the API specific\ndomain. Example:\n\n&lt;tr=\r\nack ref=3D&quot;/api/tracks/123&quot;&gt;\n  ...\n  &lt;media bitrate=3D&quot;128kbps&quot; type=3D&quot;aud=\r\nio/mpeg&quot;&gt;http://...&lt;/media&gt;\n&lt;/track&gt;\n\nWhat you think of this convention? Am=\r\n I making any sense here?\n\n--\nJonas Galvez\nSoftware Engineer\nC=F4deazur Bra=\r\nsil\n\nhttp://jonasgalvez.com.br\nhttp://codeazur.com.br\n\n"}}
