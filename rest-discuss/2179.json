Here is what I understand (I think) so far:\n\n\nGET\n------\nRetrieves a resource (actually, a representation of a resource).  Resource\nmust exist.  Action should/must be idempotent, meaning that the state of the\nresource should not change.\n\nPUT\n------\nCreates a resource.  The client dictates the URL for the new resource.\nNewly created resource on the server should/must be identical to the\nresource sent via PUT when retrieved through GET.  In other words, the\nreturned representation must match the original contents of the PUT.  If a\nclient wants to create a new resource, but does not have the authority to\ndictate the resource&#39;s URL, then the client should use POST instead (see\nbelow).  If the client wants to update a resource by replacing the entire\nresource, PUT may be used. Ootherwise, use POST (again, see below).\n\nPOST\n------\nEdit/Update a resource.  Resource must exist.  However, this does not\nnecessarily mean that a subsequent GET will return a different\nrepresentation from a GET issued before the POST.  POSTs may update a\nresource such that an existing URL will return a different representation\nvia GET, or POST may cause the creation of a new resource.  Likewise, it may\nbe possible for a POST to effect only interal changes such that subsequent\nGETs return the same representation as before the POST.\n\nIn the case where POST causes the creation of a new resource, the server\nwill assign the new URL, not the client.  Unlike PUT, if the server returns\na URL for the new resource, there is no requirement for the new resource to\nreturn an identical representation that that which was POSTed in the first\nplace.\n\nWhile POST will most often be used to update a resource or create a new\nresource, it is also possible to use POST as a &quot;black box&quot; method, where\ndata is being sent to the server, but the client has no knowledge of whether\nanything was done with the data or not.  Now, I know this is /possible/.\nHowever, with REST, is this /acceptable/?\n\nWhen I compare the HTTP verbs to SQL actions (HTTP POST =&gt; SQL UPDATE), I\nhave trouble seeing the use of POST as a &quot;black box&quot; function.  In other\nwords, I have never encountered an example of using SQL UPDATE that did\nanything other than update exactly the table I told it to update (though, as\na side effect, it may also update additional tables).  In this comparison,\nit seems to me that either I have a gross missunderstanding of what POST is\nused for, or else POST is much more general-purpose that SQL UPDATE.\n\n\nDELETE\n------\nDeletes a resource.  Resource must(?) exist.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, what do I have wrong?  Are there any scenarios for these verbs\n(particularly PUT and POST) that I have not mentioned which are also\npossible within the REST model?\n\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
