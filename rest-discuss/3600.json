But how you outlined that app is exactly how\nI&#39;d do it, and I believe it&#39;s quite RESTful.\n\nI&#39;d solve the chicken/egg prob by writing up a little app (rather than\nusing the Web server&#39;s auth/redirection capabilities) that returns 401\nwhen accessed without an Authorization header and 302 to /$userid/ when\naccessed with one, and then bind that to whatever URI you want to use to\nidentify the indirect reference (e.g. /mypage).\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.
