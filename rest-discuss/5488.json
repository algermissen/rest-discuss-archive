Those members also go away if a DELETE occurs on the\n&gt; first resource. I think. Maybe it varies by application.\n\nTheorical modeling/designing remark :) (just to be clear)\n\nThis is the difference between composition and aggregation. With\ncomposition, members should also be DELETEd (as in UML, the solid filled\ndiamond: Composition is a form of aggregation with strong ownership and\ncoincident lifetime of part with the whole), which is not the case with\nclassical aggregation (hollow diamond in UML), in witch members are\nadressable and not tied to the lifetime of the container.\n\nBack to the problem, it indeed depends on the semantic of the\nresource(s) beeing identified.\n\n\n&gt; I believe there are often multiple overlapping resources\n\nJust a thought about DELETE. What to do if several URI identify the same\nresource (doest it make sens at all from Rest POV?). May be a &quot;garbage\ncollector&quot;-like process, link counter, or unix hard link system, to\nactually delete the resource  when ALL URI have been DELETED could be\nusefull (not realy a Rest problem, just thinking... resources as\ndistributed objects). Doest it make sens ?\nURI, not links, since considering links could be quite difficult to\nimposible, if the area considered for counting them is the Web...\n\n"}}
