Is this not incorrect?  Let&#39;s say I write a REST\n&gt; service and make it compatible with both a browser and XML client, the\n&gt; browser will always get the wrong content namely XML.\n\nIndependent of the indiscriminateness of &quot;{text,application}/xml&quot;, the\nbrowser is expressing a preference for it.  I don&#39;t see how it is\ngetting the &quot;wrong&quot; content if it asks for and receive it in preference\nto &quot;text/html&quot;.\n\nThe problem you&#39;re alluding to here is a social/technical one, not\narchitectural.  The browser thinks &quot;text/xml&quot; and &quot;application/xml&quot;\nreally means &quot;application/xhtml&quot;, and for most resources that it&#39;s going\nto navigate to, that&#39;s going to be correct and work &c., so people code\nto that.  Your posts read like you think that &quot;application/xml&quot; means\nsomething else, suitable for an &quot;XML client&quot;... maybe you think it&#39;s the\ndocument&#39;s source or something along those lines.\n\nIn any case, the suggestion to (Universally) Identify each sub-Resource\nstill holds:\n\n/foo       # base resource\n/foo/html  # html rep.\n/foo/xhtml # xhtml rep.\n/foo/xml   # same content as /foo/xhtml, for browsers\n\n# the above maybe have hyperlinks to...\n/foo/source     # source, available in Source[X]ML only.\n\n# or maybe...\n/foo?view=source          # Paramaterize the Dominate Resource-space!\n/foo;view=source;type=xml # or, a not-supported-by-most-tooling way...\n\n...jsled\n\n-- \nhttp://asynchronous.org/ - `a=jsled; b=asynchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b}`\n\n"}}
