SOAP Routing\n&gt; allows a message to be directed hop by hop from one machine to another.\n&gt; Rohit Khare has made the case that this is a new mechanism for\n&gt; assembling software. Given an existing service you can add encryption,\n&gt; or logging or reliable delivery or whatever by routing it.\n\nOne of the things that Fielding notes in section 5.3.1 of his dissertation is\nthat REST&#39;s style of layered system constraints help you introduct\nintermediaries dynamically.  If you included routing semantics for multiple hops\nin the body of a message, doesn&#39;t that imply that the message then relies upon\nthe arrangement of the network to be in a certain state?\n\nIt almost seems like Rohit has expanded the scope of routing to include\nfiltering and other transformational sematics; I personally would rather keep\nthem separate.  If a client has knowledge of multiple hops of routing (in order\nto &quot;route&quot; through logging or encryption intermediaries), then you are taken\naway from routing being controlled hop-by-hop and handled below the application\nlevel.\n\n&gt; One way to do this in HTTP is to POST an HTTP message which has as its\n&gt; representation another HTTP message. This feels like it would work but\n&gt; it also feels like tunnelling HTTP over HTTP. It isn&#39;t entirely\n&gt; comfortable to me that I might have to POST a GET.\n\nI&#39;m sure you already know this, but Fielding includes the tunnel as a type of\nconnector.  This was an explicit decision based on the fact that REST components\nshould be free to switch from active component behavior to that of a tunnel.  I\nlike this approach, but I don&#39;t think routing semantics should be specified\nand/or controlled at the application level because it would seem to\nover-complicate dynamic rearrangement of services.\n\nRegardless of message flow, in REST I think it is important to preserve that 1)\nthe origin server is the ultimate recipient of requests to modify the value of\nits resources, and 2) that the user agent is the ultimate recipient of the\nresponse.\n\n-Philip\n\n\n"}}
