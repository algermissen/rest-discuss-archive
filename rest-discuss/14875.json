Defining one &#39;big&#39; media type encompassing all documents\n\n2. Defining many media types that correspond to the individual &quot;business document types&quot;\n\n\n\nPersonally, I favor the &#39;one big media type&#39; ecause I like the type to in a sense identify the domain and to subsum all the processing rules involved. OTH, it causes real dispatching pains because you do not know what you have before you poke into the body.\n\nI usually address that with the use of a profile parameter in conneg, for example: Accept: application/mydomain;profile=doctypeA[1]. Servers the know the client&#39;s preferences and can send the doctypeA (without the need to put the profile parameter on the ContentType header (where it might get stripped my interediaries anyhow).\n\nHowever, frameworks seem to be bad at that kind of conneg at the moment, hence this posting :-)\n\n\nAny thoughts or insights?\n\nJan\n\n[1] This works also well with client driven conneg, as in &lt;link href=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;application/mydomain;profile=doctypeA&quot;/&gt;\n\n"}}
