If you find\n&gt; it difficult to do, it&#39;s probably that the application is badly\n&gt; architected. So for example on dev.java.net all users have the same\n&gt; start page url\n&gt; \n&gt; https://www.dev.java.net/servlets/StartPage \n&gt; &lt;https://www.dev.java.net/servlets/StartPage&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; so what is that page really naming? How is one going to describe it ?\n&gt; One needs to describe it using some blank node such as\n&gt; \n&gt; [] :representationOf &lt;StartPage&gt;;\n&gt; :ownedBy &lt;http://bblfish.net/people/henry/card#me \n&gt; &lt;http://bblfish.net/people/henry/card#me&gt;&gt;;\n&gt; ....\n&gt; \n&gt; ie, there is no way to refer to the resource uniformly. The same is\n&gt; true of xmlrpc or soap messages. Of course the correct way to set\n&gt; this up would be to give every person their own start page\n&gt; \n&gt; @prefix sioc: &lt;http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns# &lt;http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;https://www.dev.java.net/people/bblfish \n&gt; &lt;https://www.dev.java.net/people/bblfish&gt;&gt; a sioc:User ;\n&gt; sioc:email &lt;mailto:henry.story@... \n&gt; &lt;mailto:henry.story%40bblfish.net&gt;&gt; .\n&gt; \n&gt; By this simple exercise I believe you can quickly spot and explain\n&gt; the problem with badly architected web applications.\n\nI want to believe you&#39;ve found an axiomatic means to describe \ncontrollers URLs, because I think controller URLs are broken, and \ntransitively, any framework that encourages them, is broken.. However I \n  suspect not being able to apply some presupposed predicate (via RDF) \ndoes not a bad URL make; the problem here could just as well be proper \nnaming.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n\n"}}
