A particular client would obviously be coded to\n&gt; support this/those media types.  Just as a browser understands a\n&gt; resource of type text/html, image/jpeg, etc, my app would understand\n&gt; resources of type application/rent-a-room+xml for example.  \n&gt; \n\nMy usual caveats still apply -- this isn&#39;t quite REST, because \nintermediaries won&#39;t understand the media type (which should be\nregistered as application/vnd.rent-a-room+xml as your syntax is reserved\nfor registered, standards-track media types; or, use application/x.rent-\na-room+xml if you don&#39;t intend to register your media type).  On\nthe Web, the desired property of scalability is achieved by re-using\nubiquitous media types. There is nothing about renting a room which\ncan&#39;t be expressed as HTML, so why not re-use HTML?  That way, all the\nvast-and-sundry components which do interesting things with ubiquitous\nmedia types like text/html can participate in the communication.\n\nWhen you send unknowns in Content-Type, you limit yourself to caching,\nand maybe not even that as many caches are configured to only cache a\nhandful of ubiquitous media types which cover the bulk of the traffic\nthey encounter.  Why waste cache resources on media types nobody uses?\nWhat do links look like in application/vnd.rent-a-room+xml, and how are \nintermediaries supposed to recognize them as links?\n\nVarious other desired properties of REST are impacted as well, like\nmaintainability -- better to re-use standard libraries most developers\nunderstand, than custom libraries code maintainers have to be trained\non.  Most HTTP components out there have a-priori knowledge of &lt;a&gt; in\nmultiple media types, which is why they can follow links.  REST is\nabout playing to the capabilities of the deployed Web infrastructure,\nrather than bucking them.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
