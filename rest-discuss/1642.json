So 201 or 202 should\nindicate status relating to the resource/represtation that was created or\naccepted, and nothing more.\n\nSpecfically, in the example [1], the user agent is POSTing a &#39;new trip&#39;\nrepresentation that will be subordinate to the &#39;trips&#39; resource located at node\n&#39;services.travelagents.com&#39;.  What the origin server does while processing the\n&#39;new trip&#39; representation is none of the user agent&#39;s business, above and beyond\nwhether the subordinate resource was created or accepted by the superordinate\nresource.\n\n(If I&#39;m representing (pun intended) this right, the exact details of what\n&#39;create&#39; and/or &#39;accept&#39; mean is something that, at this level, is only known by\nthe origin server.)\n\nNow, if the subordinate resource was created, then I would think a 201 should be\nreturned, and the Location header field should contain the URI of newly created\nresource.\n\nThoughts?\n\n-Philip\n\n[1] For people new to this discussion:\nhttp://conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/RestGoesToMaui\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: S.

The request might or might not\n&gt; eventually be acted upon...The entity returned with this response SHOULD\n&gt; include an indication of the request&#39;s current status and either a pointer\n&gt; to a status monitor or some estimate of when the user can expect the\nrequest\n&gt; to be fulfilled.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; If you do use 202, should the returned location should be something like\n&gt; http://services.travelagents.com/status/0173/ or\n&gt; http://services.travelagents.com/trips/0173/status/ ?\n&gt; Is it acceptable to return the actual location of the trip as you have\ndone\n&gt; and then have the representation at that URI initially be a status saying\n&gt; &#39;processing x% complete&#39; and then when processing is completed the\n&gt; representation changes to be the actual trip?\n&gt; Given that this is REST then a URI is a representation of the current\nstate\n&gt; of a resource, so it sounds reasonable that if the current state IS &#39;x%\n&gt; complete&#39;  then it is reasonable to return THAT as a representation, does\nit not?\n&gt;\n&gt; Robert\n\n\n"}}
