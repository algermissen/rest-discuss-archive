Good point.\n\n&gt; Therefore building parallel systems is a poor solution to that problem \n&gt; compared\n&gt; to cross-training, code review, and automated testing.\n\nNow that point about automated testing turned on yet another lightbulb here. \nOne of the issues I have had with the many websites I have been building is \nthe lack of automatic testing. The HTML generated from ASP.NET makes it way \ntoo difficult for that. I have always been annoyed by this but accepted it \nin lack of better ways (my job has always been in a .NET shop).\n\nWith ASP.NET MVC a lot has changed to the better. If I start combining the \nideas from the discussions here with the goal of making the website testable \nthen things suddenly change a lot in favor of one single User + M2M website. \nMaking the website testable is not only better for QA but it is also a near \nguarantee that the website can function as a M2M REST API in itself.\n\nInteresting indeed :-)\n\n/Jørn\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Benjamin Hawkes-Lewis&quot; &lt;bhawkeslewis@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;Jørn Wildt&quot; &lt;jw@...&gt;\nCc: &quot;Rest Discussion List&quot; &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, December 29, 2010 1:38 AM\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] Combining HTML and XML?\n\n\nOn Tue, Dec 28, 2010 at 9:51 PM, Jørn Wildt &lt;jw@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Agreed. But I am not striving towards a good h2m interface - only an\n&gt; acceptable one that will allow a developer of a client to interact with my\n&gt; API using a standard browser. Nothing fancy.\n&gt;\n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t expect my perfectly polished end-user website to be used as a \n&gt; REST\n&gt; API. But maybe I am wrong here too. It could just be that, assuming I am\n&gt; going to develop that end-user website anyway, it would be faster to\n&gt; incoorporate m2m details in a fancy end-user website, than developing both \n&gt; a\n&gt; end-user website and a REST API on a secondary webserver.\n\nIndeed.\n\n&gt; It would just be so different than my (the?) usual conception of a REST \n&gt; API\n&gt; as a stand-alone API decoupled from the end-user website. One typical\n&gt; difference is the access control where the end-user website uses cookies,\n&gt; whereas the REST API uses some of the HTTP authentication schemes.\n\nTypical websites and APIs (even those marketed as RESTful) differ radically\nfrom a REST service as defined by Fielding.\n\nThis is especially clear when Fielding discusses RESTful ecommerce:\n\n&quot;the use of cookies to identify a user-specific &quot;shopping basket&quot; within a\nserver-side database could be more efficiently implemented by defining the\nsemantics of shopping items within the hypermedia data formats, allowing the\nuser agent to select and store those items within their own client-side\nshopping basket, complete with a URI to be used for check-out when the \nclient\nis ready to purchase&quot;\n\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/evaluation.htm#sec_6_3\n\nSee also:\n\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/3583\n\nThis may be a good time to remind you that non-RESTful services may benefit\nfrom adopting RESTful ideas, without becoming a Fielding-certifiable\nRESTful service …\n\nAlso, what stops you abstracting authentication to accept either\ncookies-based auth _or_ HTTP auth for the same service?\n\n&gt; It would also be way to easy to break the API the first time someone puts \n&gt; a\n&gt; new theme template on the end-user website.  Better to have web designers\n&gt; working on the end-user website and coders to work on the REST API.\n\nYou&#39;re trying to solve a _social_ problem where you have an absence of\nquality control over critical parts of your system.\n\nPeople who cannot maintain the HTML for a HATEOS service cannot maintain the\nHTML for a quality website, and vice versa. Both of these tasks require a \nclose\nattention to markup semantics and how clients (browsers, spiders, assistive\ntechnology, automated testing software, API clients, etc.), and behind them\nhuman beings (surfers, searchers, people with disabilities, test-writers,\nthird-party developers, etc.), are going to interface with those semantics.\n\nTherefore building parallel systems is a poor solution to that problem \ncompared\nto cross-training, code review, and automated testing.\n\nBuilding a single HATEOS service forces you to:\n\n   1. Think about how human beings will want to view, interact with, and add \nto\nyour data.\n   2. Think about how to manage changes so that clients (whether human\nor machine) can adapt.\n\nThese are challenges, but being forced to think about human interaction with\nyour service is arguably a very good thing, for example for ensuring your\ndomain modelling is good and your pace of change is right.\n\n--\nBenjamin Hawkes-Lewis \n\n\n"}}
