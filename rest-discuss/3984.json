Has anybody\n&gt; analized that\n&gt;  in detail or can help me with some pointers?\n\nWell, independent of REST, the benefit of global naming has been\ndiscussed for many many years.  Not that I&#39;m very familiar with the\nhistory, but you might look up the work of Engelbart (Augment/NLS), or\nNelson (Xanadu).  Sorry I can&#39;t be more specific.  I&#39;m sure somebody\nhere who&#39;s more familiar with hypertext would have a good pointer.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.   Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA.        http://www.markbaker.ca\n\n"}}
