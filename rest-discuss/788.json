The\nkey difference is that EBI styles are push-based. The component containing\nthe state (equivalent to an origin server in REST) issues an event whenever\nthe state changes, whether or not any component is actually interested in or\nlistening for such an event. In the REST style, consuming components usually\npull representations. Although this is less efficient when viewed as a\nsingle client wishing to monitor a single resource, the scale of the Web\nmakes an unregulated push model infeasible.&quot;\n\nThe part with &#39;whether or not any component is actually interested in or\nlistening&#39; would seem to be dealt with through subscriptions - which might\nimply that a regulated push model might be feasible.\n\n\n\n"}}
