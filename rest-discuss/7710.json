Not having the parameter value, but having the 1234 determined\n&gt;&gt; by the server and then the client informed by the 303 response works well.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was entailing a POST to /items would create a 201 (&#39;created&#39;) with\n&gt; an ETag of either the redirect URL or the resource identifier\n&gt; (although none feels &quot;best&quot; to me). If I do a 303 on the /items URL\n&gt; then that&#39;s saying the /items resource has moved permanently\n&gt; elsewhere?\n\n201 is grand but I&#39;m unsure as to whether existing UAs then move to that \nresource or not. 303 doesn&#39;t imply /items has moved, 303 is &quot;See Other&quot; \nand means that the POST to /items has done something and the URI in the \nheader shows where something relating to what was done is GETtable.\n\n&gt; I guess a POST is ok for 410 but not for 404 in this case. Hmm, maybe\n&gt; I should try to avoid that, and just allow another POST to the /items\n&gt; URL and use the session hash (1234) as a parameter to override the\n&gt; creation of a new and instead use the one I know about. Thoughts?\n\nPOST acts on a resource. 410 indicates the resource is gone. How can you \nact on something that has gone?\n\nIt&#39;ll probably work, but it smells bad to me.\n\n\n"}}
