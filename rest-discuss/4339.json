This is me getting dogmatic on the basis of some \nconversation I remember having w/ The Powers ;-) a while back.\n\nAssume I&#39;ve got a USER abstraction that is characterized as having the \nfollowing component data:\n\n\tid\t(ranges over usernames like joebob)\n\tfirstName  (a string)\n\tlastName (a string)\n\tssn (an SSN)\n\tphoneNum (a phone number)\n\nand I&#39;m modeling\n\n\t/Users\t(abstraction of all the users known to the system)\n\nand\n\n\t/Users/&lt;user&gt;\t(where user is a known id;  this is an abstraction of a \ngiven user)\n\nLet&#39;s say that /Users/&lt;user&gt; excepts POST of form variables:\n\n\tid\t(ranges over usernames like joebob)\n\tfirstName  (a string)\n\tlastName (a string)\n\tssn (an SSN)\n\tphoneNum (a phone number)\n\nor, looking at it from a psuedo-XML perspective:\n\n\t&lt;User ...&gt;\n\t\t&lt;id&gt;...&lt;/id&gt;\n\t\t&lt;firstName&gt;...&lt;/firstName&gt;\n\t\t&lt;lastName&gt;...&lt;/lastName&gt;\n\t\t&lt;ssn&gt;...&lt;/ssn&gt;\n\t\t&lt;phoneNum&gt;...&lt;/phoneNum&gt;\n\t&lt;/User&gt;\n\nThe question is as follows:  is it reasonable to consider a *partial* \nrepresentation of a thing such as a User above to *be* a representation \nof a User?  What are the semantics of the missing elements?\n\nMy argument --- cribbing earlier arguments with wiser folks than myself \n--- is that if partial representations are excepted, e.g. if \n/Users/joebob can take a form just containing elements id and ssn, that \nyou&#39;re in effect not doing literal REpresentational State Transfer --- \nrather you&#39;re selectively invoking one of a set of polymorphic methods \nnamed POST where the size of the set is determined by the total number \nof permutations of required and optional elements, with dispatch being \ndone by hand over that space.  Worse, some permutations may be legal \nand unamiguous, while other may be illegal, while others may be legal \nbut ambiguous.  Ugh.  In doing this, you&#39;ve in effect undermined the \ncompositional complexity benefit (the O(n) vs. O(n^2) argument) of \nRESTlike systems.  Not to mention made the dispatcher / validator&#39;s job \ncombinatorially harder.\n\nIf, as Lucas says, representational completeness is only for PUT, then \nwe&#39;ve again relegated POST to being a tunnel for arbitrary methods --- \nwe&#39;re just doing the dispatch on value rather than on some discrete \nselector like method name.  Seems to me, anyway.\n\nNB, aside:  yes, dispatch on content type of PUT or POSTed \nrepresentations also muddies the water.  But better that, IMHO, than \nwilly-nilly combinatorial compositional complexity.\n\njb\n\n\n"}}
