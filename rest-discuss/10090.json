I&#39;m using the version identifier as the ETag for\n&gt; the related resources, so far so good. As the clients update the\n&gt; entities, they send a PUT request with a IF-MATCH header with their\n&gt; last version identifier so we can avoid some concurrency problems with\n&gt; optimistic locking. To create the versioning identifier I&#39;m digesting\n&gt; (SHA-256) the resource state: I&#39;m exchanging a very small chance of\n&gt; collision against the chance to detect previously sent updates. When a\n&gt; client send a PUT request I have the IF-MATCH ETag and I compute the\n&gt; new ETag automatically. Now suppose this sequence of events:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Client A sents PUT ... (IF-MATCH: &quot;XXX&quot;) ... FOO ...\n&gt; 2. Server process the request and sends the new ETag: YYY\n&gt; 3. Client B sents PUT ... (IF-MATCH: &quot;YYY&quot;) ... BAR\n&gt; 4. Server process the request and sends the new ETag: ZZZ\n&gt; 5. Client A retries the first PUT (network problems, double submit, it\n&gt; doesn&#39;t matter) sends ETag: YYY\n&gt; \n&gt; My application can compute the new version identifier for FOO and\n&gt; it will always be YYY, so doing a quick check it finds this version\n&gt; already persisted and it can safely assume that it&#39;s a duplicate\n&gt; submission. My question is: can it return a 200 to this duplicate\n&gt; request or it must return a 412, as per section 14.24? AFAICT\n&gt; returning 200 should be OK, but I don&#39;t want to take chances of going\n&gt; against the Internet ;) or messing with some subtle implicit rule\n&gt; about caching (e.g. some intermediate cache between both client A and\n&gt; client B overwrite B&#39;s update and become inconsistent) .\n\nCould you elaborate why you think not sending a 412 would be ok? It \nseems 14.24 is clear enough:\n\n&quot;If none of the entity tags match, or if &quot;*&quot; is given and no current \nentity exists, the server MUST NOT perform the requested method, and \nMUST return a 412 (Precondition Failed) response. This behavior is most \nuseful when the client wants to prevent an updating method, such as PUT, \nfrom modifying a resource that has changed since the client last \nretrieved it.&quot; -- \n&lt;http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2616.html#rfc.section.14.24.p.5&gt;\n\nSo yes, PUT isn&#39;t idempotent when used as a conditional request.\n\nBR, Julian\n\n\n\n"}}
