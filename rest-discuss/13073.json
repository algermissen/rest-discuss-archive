I have one part of m=\r\ny design right now where I&#39;m unsure what a good RESTful approach would be.\n=\r\n\nI have resources that support GET and PUT, but contain some parts that cli=\r\nents are not allowed to modify. (This doesn&#39;t seem like an uncommon case; I=\r\n would think that navigation links, for example, would typically not be mod=\r\nifiable in a PUT.) So is it better to:\n\n1. Require clients to submit all th=\r\ne read-only parts unmodified in a PUT, and respond with an error code if th=\r\ney are absent or altered?\n2. Take advantage of the leniency allowed in a se=\r\nrver&#39;s implementation of PUT to ignore the read-only elements (or their abs=\r\nence)?\n3. Separate read-only elements into a sub-resource that only support=\r\ns GET? (This may not be feasible for resources which must be created as a w=\r\nhole.)\n\nor something else?\n\nSecond, there are some elements that are modifi=\r\nable or not depending on the privileges held by the (authenticated) user. I=\r\n would think this would be expressed by a difference in the representation =\r\nreturned to the client, but what should that difference be? (My representat=\r\nions are XML documents, if there isn&#39;t a more general solution.)\n\nAnd in a =\r\nbroader sense, I&#39;d like the client to know which elements of the resource t=\r\nhe user can modify, for presentation purposes. Is there a generally accepte=\r\nd way to do this, perhaps with form templates or XForms?\n\nI&#39;d be interested=\r\n in any comments or alternative approaches, if I&#39;m just looking at it from =\r\nthe wrong angle.\n\nThanks,\n\n  -- Jim\n\n\n"}}
