It is one of the key business-level protocols. My \n&gt; conclusion from previous discussions would be two HTTP exchanges:\n&gt; 1. offer-ack\n&gt; 2. businessResponse-ack\n&gt; where businessResponse could be &quot;accept&quot;, &quot;reject&quot; or some variation \n&gt; on &quot;let&#39;s negotiate, I will make a counter-offer next&quot;.\n\nJust to clarify, is &quot;ack&quot; a business level ack (&quot;got your offer,\nI&#39;ll check it out and get back to you&quot;), or a transfer level ack\n(&quot;received your message&quot;)?\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
