It&#39;s the same as case #4:\n\n&gt; &gt; 4. The whole economic exchange between two trading partners may \nbe \n&gt; &gt; hyperlinked into a network of economic exchanges - a value system \nor \n&gt; &gt; supply chain.  For example, if I order a computer from Dell, my \n&gt; &gt; economic exchange with Dell may be hyperlinked to a slot on \nDell&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; assembly schedule, which in turn may be hyperlinked to economic \n&gt; &gt; exchanges with Dell&#39;s suppliers for components, etc., turtles all \nthe \n&gt; &gt; way down.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think the type of composition I have in mind could be used for all\n&gt; of these, though I&#39;d focus on building more generic patterns as I\n&gt; described above, with the hopes that it would cover off what you&#39;ve\n&gt; written there.\n\nSee below.\n\n&gt; When I think of this stuff, I inevitably think back to Bill \nMcarthy&#39;s\n&gt; presentation at OOPSLA &#39;97 Business Object workshop, about REA and\n&gt; the various interaction patterns seen in business;\n&gt; \n&gt; http://jeffsutherland.com/oopsla97/oo97final.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunately the content of that presentation isn&#39;t available, but \nI\n&gt; remember the gist quite clearly.\n\nYes, I&#39;m still working closely witb Bill, and everything I&#39;m talking \nabout here has his basic REA give-take pattern right in the middle of \nit.  We also collaborated in a UN/CEFACT project entitled Business \nCollaboration Patterns and Monitored Commitments.  My goal was to \nstart to define the patterns you request above.\n\nThe project had some problems, including my lacks of time and \nresources, but I think I know how to define the stuff now, although \nthe work of clearly writing the patterns remains.  \n\nOne of the missing pieces was REST.  I was not happy with the way \nebXML did some things.  REST is better.\n\nOnward!\n\nAnd have fun,\nBob Haugen\n\n\n\n"}}
