But they aren&#39;t specific to REST, they are spec=\r\nific to a uniform interface (e.g. URI + HTTP + a media format).\n\nWeb browse=\r\nrs are generic clients for URI + HTTP + HTML.\nIn the telephony space, Voice=\r\n browsers are generic clients for URI + HTTP + VoiceXML. Some Voice browser=\r\ns also understand CCXML -- which is an interesting format because it&#39;s mach=\r\nine driven. It stands as a counter example to the argument that a generic c=\r\nlient must be guided by a human being.\n\nThe ability to write a generic clie=\r\nnt that is able to work with any service that adheres to a uniform interfac=\r\ne is one of the key benefits of REST IMO.\n\nRegards,\n\nAndrew\n\n\n"}}
