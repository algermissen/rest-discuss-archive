That the DELETE happened based on your\n&gt; specific request or just that a DELETE at &quot;some point&quot; had happened?\n&gt;\n\nThe objective is to inform the user of the results of the user&#39;s\nrequest.  If someone else&#39;s DELETE succeeded first, then a success\nresponse would not be illustrative of the handling of the user&#39;s\nrequest, but its handling of some other request.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; What if the system executes other behaviors based on that success\n&gt; (did it not cause to happen)?\n&gt;\n\nImplementation details are hidden behind the uniform interface.  All we\ncan inform the user about, is the result of the specific request that\nthe user made.  The only method that guarantees the user agent isn&#39;t\nresponsible for side-effects of the request, is GET.  Other than that,\nno assumptions may be made about &quot;what else happened&quot; as a result of a\nsuccessful request.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
