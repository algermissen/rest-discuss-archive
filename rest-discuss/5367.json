A browser need not know if a URI in a &lt;img \n/&gt; element refers to a file or a process which dynamically generates an \nimage, and an RDF parser need know nothing about the URI beyond the \nstring of characters that composes it.\n\nHTTP URIs are not entirely opaque in this fashion, since for historical \nreasons the presence or absense of a query portion dictates the default \ncaching behaviour in the case of their being no relevant headers.\n\n"}}
