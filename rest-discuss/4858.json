I have identified the following resources\n\nworkItems - collection of all workItems\nworkLists - collection of work item lists for role or participant\nroles - list of all roles in a domain\nparticipants - list of all participants in a domain.\n\nI am in the process of identifying appropriate URIs for the systems\nand have come up with the following.\n\ncreate a work item:            post /workItems\nget a work item:               get /workItems/&lt;workItemId&gt;\nedit a work item:              post /workItems/&lt;workItemId&gt;\naccept work item:              put /workItems/workItemId&gt;/state\nabort work item:               put /workItems/&lt;workItemId&gt;/state\ncomplete work item:            put /workItems/&lt;workItemId&gt;/state\nrestart work item:             put /workItems/&lt;workItemId&gt;/state\nreassign work item:            put /workItems/&lt;workItemId&gt;/state\nsave work item:                put /workItems/&lt;workItemId&gt;/data\nget work item history:         get /workItems/&lt;workItemId&gt;/history\nget my work list:              get /workLists/myWorkList\nget work list for participant: get /workLists/&lt;participantName&gt;\nget work list for role:        get /workLists/&lt;roleName&gt;\n\nCan anyone provide feedback on the URIs since this is my first\niteration and I have struggled whether to use POST or PUT for\nsubsequent modifications to a resource. From my understanding I should\nbe using POST for partial representations and PUT for complete\nrepresentation. In the case of &#39;edit work item&#39; i use a post because I\nwill not be passing back the complete representation of the resource.\nIs this correct or am I whistling in the wind?\n\n\ncheers\n&lt;/jima&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
