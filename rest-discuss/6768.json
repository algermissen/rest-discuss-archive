Fielding wrote:\nlanguage-specific variant.\n&gt; \n&gt; In other words, resources don&#39;t have translations. Each resource has\n&gt; a given meaning. When that meaning includes content negotiation, remote\n&gt; authoring has to be managed as a set of subsidiary/specific resources\n&gt; that indirectly change the set of variant representations of the\n&gt; negotiated resource. \n\nGreat ;) cos here&#39;s a nuts and bolts issue in HTTP/Web design that I&#39;m \nnever quite sure on. If I do have a translation t of a resource r, is \nthe right thing to\n\n  a) give t and r distinct URLs (make t and r distinct resources)\n\n  b) use the language headers to give the UA the variant it asked for \n(make t a representation of r)\n\n  c) some combination/ladder/mishmash that involves both\n\n  d) none of the above/it depends\n\nI&#39;m prone to leaning towards &quot;a&quot; for two reasons. First and to be \nhonest, most frameworks seem to push me into it (&quot;?lang=xx&quot;). Second it \nsupports a case where the user can &quot;read this in klingon&quot; via hypertext.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
