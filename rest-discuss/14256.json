I\n    Eric&gt; don&#39;t t=\r\nhink anyone disputes the fact that REST is hard to\n    Eric&gt; learn.  But wh=\r\ny is that?  I&#39;ve convinced myself it&#39;s not\n    Eric&gt; because the students a=\r\nre morons, but that we, collectively\n    Eric&gt; as a community, have failed =\r\nto teach it properly.  The best\n    Eric&gt; evidence of that, is the recent t=\r\nhread asking for examples\n    Eric&gt; of good REST systems: It&#39;s infinitely e=\r\nasier to find REST\n    Eric&gt; implementations that aren&#39;t, than it is to fin=\r\nd good\n    Eric&gt; examples (I&#39;ve seen REST implemented effectively on\n    Er=\r\nic&gt; Intranets where the client is a known quantity) that we can\n    Eric&gt; p=\r\noint to.\n\nVery interesting thoughts.\n\nMay I add that the REST community her=\r\ne also has a bit of a Zen\napproach to REST questions? Responses are also us=\r\nually of the kind\nthis is not it, or not close yet :-)\n\nA while ago I saw a=\r\n presentation that defined REST levels. I think\nthat&#39;s very helpful. First =\r\nget people to think about naming things\nproperly (every resource has a name=\r\n), about verbs: use put/delete, and\nuse proper http response codes.\n\nFrom t=\r\nhere on we can work on representations (content types, quality)\ntill we rea=\r\nch nirvana, the self describing system where clients have\nno dependencies. =\r\nPerhaps. I think the last part is probably less\ninteresting then the basics=\r\n.\n\nOnce people have a feeling for the basics they want more. In my\nexperien=\r\nce it&#39;s the basics where people have the initial trouble as\nthey&#39;re so used=\r\n to RPC style thinking because all frameworks they have\nworked with use tha=\r\nt, as you also indicate.\n\nPeople who name their resources, use put/delete, =\r\nwant more.\n\n\n    Eric&gt; In brief: Define resources in terms of standard medi=\r\na types\n    Eric&gt; and link relations, saving URI allocation and method\n    =\r\nEric&gt; selection for the implementation phase.\n\nAnd I think this is way, way=\r\n too abstract if you&#39;re new. It&#39;s the\nstandard media types and link relatio=\r\nns that take a while to sink in.\n\nSo I suggest it the other way around.\n\n--=\r\n \nAll the best,\n\nBerend de Boer\n\n"}}
