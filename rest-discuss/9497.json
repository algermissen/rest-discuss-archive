Would you like me to re-word my prior post?\n\n&quot;I still say to meet this constraint PUT must be given replacement \nsemantics in HTTP just as STOR must be given replacement semantics in \nFTP.&quot;\n\nNowhere do I imply this has anything to do with overwriting a file on \ndisk, that is not what &quot;replacement semantics&quot; means by any stretch.  \nReplacing a file on disk vs. changing umpteen database fields is an \nimplementation detail, not different semantics being applied to the \nmethod used.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
