I find that the shared-nothing mindset\nof PHP is certainly relevant and is quite &quot;REST&quot;-ish. Of course, what\nyou can do in one language you can do in another (Turing-completeness\nand all), but the success of PHP (i.e., it is widely deployed) is due,\nin some degree, to its inherent &quot;web&quot;-ness. Of course, that leads\nto some shady practices like overuse of global variables (because\neverything is wiped out at the end of the request anyway) which is bad\nfor all kinds of reasons. It&#39;s no more difficult to write good PHP than\ngood Python, it&#39;s just easier to write bad PHP than bad Python. I simply\nfind that PHP works &quot;with the grain&quot; of REST. The ability to distribute\nprocesses that is a mark of good RESTful design is related to those\nqualities that make PHP attractive to shared hosting providers.\n\n\n&gt; &gt; Django has a nice framework for dispatching based on Regexps. If you\n&gt; &gt; follow this technique it&#39;s a lot more natural to identify resources\n&gt; &gt; with a URI and attach the one script that takes some parameters, to a\n&gt; &gt; bunch of URIs.. .e.g. http://server.com/(&#92;w+)/(&#92;w+) could map the\n&gt; &gt; regex matches to variables like userName, pageId... or catalogId,\n&gt; &gt; partNumber... whatever.\n&gt; \n\nIndeed it does, but taking on the overhead of a framework like Django\ncan be a bit much when what you need is URL dispatching. I realize some\nfolks will disagree, but the available frameworks out there are, for my\ntaste, too much overhead especially when taking a RESTful approach to\napplication design (i.e., client will request a url and I&#39;ll send back\na resource), not having to worry to much about side-effects, etc. In\nfact, I find the opportunity to simply make a libcurl call or use the\ndocument() function in XSLT against RESTful interfaces (in the course\nof answering a single request), the application code itself become very\nsimple. Often the database access layer itself can be exposed as a\nREST/HTTP interface, so that the entire application code is a set of\nRESTful interfaces that will be consumed -- either by a client or by the\ncode itself.\n\nAll the framework you need for most (MVC) applications is a URL\ndispatcher, a database layer or ORM, and a templating/presentation\nlayer.  In PHP, you have PDO, etc. for database layer, Smarty,XSLT, or\nPHP itself for templating, and you can write a URL dispatcher w/o too\nmuch difficulty.\n\nI have taken a LOT from reading Joe Gregorio&#39;s posts about his\n&quot;throw-away&quot; framework\n(http://bitworking.org/news/Why_so_many_Python_web_frameworks) and one\nlesson, although not perhaps the intended one, is that REST is your\nframework, not Rails or Django or Struts or whatever.  REST provides\nmost of the &quot;definitions&quot; that you need to get the job done.  Why not\nwrite a framework in 60 lines of Python (or PHP)?  And while you are at it, maybe\neven change you mind about throwing it away...\n\n--peter keane\nhttp://daseproject.org\nhttp://code.google.com/p/dase/\n\n\n&gt; I actually picked Django for my project, at least until I run into\n&gt; some showstopper.  But I find that it is a lot more difficult and\n&gt; expensive to find hosting for Django than PHP.  (And more expensive\n&gt; yet for J2EE...)\n&gt; \n&gt; I know that is not exactly synonymous with RESTfulness, but there&#39;s\n&gt; something about a language designed for the Web, regardless of its\n&gt; other qualities, that makes it fit better.\n\n"}}
