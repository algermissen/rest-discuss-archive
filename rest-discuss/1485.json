That&#39;s a performance concern.\n\nBut I&#39;m getting a little lost in the discussion. Don&#39;t you need to fetch\nthe list of patients to get the link to the &quot;runtime schema&quot;? So you\nstill have a performance issue. If you&#39;re thinking about performance\nthen maybe the schema should be the parent object and the list should be\nthe child. Or they could have a common parent (perhaps it summarizes\ninformation from the patient list).\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure I understand. In our system there is either a human entering\n&gt; the data into the fields for each resource or there is another automated\n&gt; interface that knows how to map fields from systems in other parts of the\n&gt; hospital into our fields. Either way, they need to know the basic structure\n&gt; of the objects including the field names, types, constraints, etc.\n\nOkay, but in the case where it is a machine doing the filling in, that\ninformation needs to be available at *design time* so making it also\navailable at runtime is redundant extra work for the service designer\n(you). Nevertheless, if human beings will be filling it in then of\ncourse it IS useful because there may not be a &quot;design time&quot;. You could\nuse something like HTML forms or XForms.\n\nAnd come to think of it, if the same schema is used at runtime and\ndesign time then there is no extra effort providing a link to it at\nruntime. Maybe that&#39;s what you were thinking about.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
