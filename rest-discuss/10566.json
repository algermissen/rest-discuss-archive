The whole point of being RESTful is that\nthe resource is a *representation*, not the actual thing. The whole\nidea is the resource is very much like a Topic in Topic Maps (which I\nknow you know :), and then let you choose which Occurrence you want to\nreceive of that Topic.\n\nIn applications (somewhat unlike plain info websites), this is vital,\nas various applications can support various things. Browsers handle\nthis in rather dumb ways, and just pick the first from the list they\nknow, but in reality I should be able to point to [picture], and if\nthere&#39;s different versions of that, be able to choose the\nhigh-resolution instead of the default low-resolution one. If support\nfor this were better handled by browsers we wouldn&#39;t be in this messy\nparameter and / or file extension soup we&#39;re in.\n\n\nAlex\n-- \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Project Wrangler, SOA, Information Alchemist, UX, RESTafarian, Topic Maps\n------------------------------------------ http://shelter.nu/blog/ --------\n\n"}}
