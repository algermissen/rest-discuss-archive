Rather, I was suggesting that something like\n&gt; WD-Proxy&#39;s notification scheme be generalized so that the\n&gt; notification receiver is\n&gt; topology-independent;\n\nGot it.  That&#39;s an important distinction.\n\n&gt; Hmmm.  Does it really matter?  After all, all we&#39;re doing is sending\n&gt; a message back\n&gt; to the client that says &quot;come and get it again.&quot;  There&#39;s no reason\n&gt; &quot;it&quot; can&#39;t be a\n&gt; CGI. Is there?\n\n-- Just to clarify, I was thinking about the source side of things rather than\nthe sink side.\n\n&gt; &gt; One-shots\n&gt; &gt; =========\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I haven&#39;t been able to think of a problem with one-shot notifications, and I\n&gt; &gt; have been able to think of advantages.  So I am a strong +1 for this.\n&gt;\n&gt; This IMO is the real meat of the deal.  I think it&#39;s HUGELY advantageous.\n\nIs anybody on the list against one-shot notifications?  Are there disadvantages\nnot seen here?  Speak now or hold your peace.\n\nI think that multiple-shot notifications are a sloppy way of introducing more\ninformation into the channel, so they&#39;re really a form of updates.  For example\nyou might use multiple shot notifications on an email account to allow the\nclient to count the number of unread messages.  That&#39;s useful, but flawed enough\nthat I&#39;d leave equivalent functionality to any http-updates project that may\nhappen.  Keep the scope of hEvents minimal enough to do a good job, and\nhopefully lay the groundwork for related projects like persistent GET and\nhttp-updates.\n\n\n&gt; In general I agree.  There are some &quot;pros,&quot; though.  I thought you&#39;d\n&gt; like this, as\n&gt; it does allow client implementations to support a *very* minimal\n&gt; protocol --- they\n&gt; only need to accept NOTIFY on port 80.  IMO, that&#39;s cleaner than overloading\n&gt; standard HTTP method (GET) and using an older and much laxer version\n&gt; of the HTTP\n&gt; spec.\n\nUh, pretty much _anything_ is cleaner than that.  Actually, I&#39;ve been thinking\nabout PSP as two separate things munged together - a &quot;mole&quot; communications\npattern and idempotent notifications.  The mole pattern is that one party, a\nrequester, has almost total control over the communications stream.  The mole\npattern has to use idempotent notifications, but idempotent notifications don&#39;t\nhave to use the mole pattern.\n\n&gt; &gt; which book, Jeff?\n&gt;\n&gt; Ari was head of server development at CERN back in the day, then ran proxy\n&gt; development at Netscape.  His book &quot;Web Proxy Servers&quot; [1] is one of\n&gt; the classics;\n&gt; it was released in about &#39;98.  A lot of the information is now out of\n&gt; date, but it&#39;s\n&gt; still worth a read.  Note that it doesn&#39;t talk about WD-Proxy, but it\n&gt; does have a\n&gt; great explanation of the various age / freshness tradeoffs and algorithms.\n&gt;\n\nOh, yeah, I remember that I was excited when it came out but slacked on actually\ngetting it....\n\n\n"}}
