This is perhaps the way you would like the world to be. But REST\n&gt; is just about resources and representations. You may think something ending\n&gt; in a slash/ refers to a directory, but it could also be a concept, a\n&gt; building, a person, an ontology, or any other number of things...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Its better than &quot;kind&quot; imho, but what I don&#39;t like about this is that\n&gt;&gt; it re enforces the notion that the URI template thing ( or pretty\n&gt;&gt; URLs) is very important and should match directly to something in your\n&gt;&gt; actual system.\n&gt;\n&gt; Pretty URLs are very useful for maintaining a site. But what is pretty to\n&gt; you may not be to someone else, and you will never be able to control\n&gt; anything other than your own site. By all means do try to do things in an\n&gt; intuitive way, but don&#39;t confuse that with the much more general nature of\n&gt; REST.\n&gt;\n&gt; Henry\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thanks\n&gt;&gt; Devdatta\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; [1] http://www.agilemodeling.com/style/packageDiagram.htm\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 2008/9/2 Alexander Johannesen &lt;alexander.johannesen@...&gt;:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; On Tue, Sep 2, 2008 at 11:47, Stefan Tilkov &lt;stefan.tilkov@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m trying to describe the process of RESTful application (or\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interface) design. Maybe I should just leave it &quot;decide which kinds of\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; resources you want to expose&quot;, but I was wondering whether this &quot;kind&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thing\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; merits its own term.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Good question. I think the answer is &#39;yes&#39;, but as such not defined\n&gt;&gt;&gt; within the REST scope itself.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I tend to favor DDD (Domain-driven Design) these days, so every\n&gt;&gt;&gt; primary entity and their immediate entities have a guaranteed resource\n&gt;&gt;&gt; exposure, whether I have an actual pre-defined use for them or not. (I\n&gt;&gt;&gt; know this sounds strange and even bad practice to a lot of people, but\n&gt;&gt;&gt; it has saved the day in too many projects for me to ignore their\n&gt;&gt;&gt; usefulness :) After that there&#39;s some heavy thinking about &quot;what kind\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of stuff you want to expose&quot; which normally ends up in a few good\n&gt;&gt;&gt; workshops. Not sure that &quot;kind&quot; can even be typified, but I guess\n&gt;&gt;&gt; there&#39;s that useful portmanteau of &quot;things&quot; and &quot;actions&quot; that can be\n&gt;&gt;&gt; defined a bit (and this resonates well with the minimal REST\n&gt;&gt;&gt; interface).\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Alex\n&gt;&gt;&gt; --\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Project Wrangler, SOA, Information Alchemist, UX, RESTafarian, Topic Maps\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------ http://shelter.nu/blog/\n&gt;&gt;&gt; --------\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
