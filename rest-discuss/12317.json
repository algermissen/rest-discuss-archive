Well, yes, it does.  Instead of saying it\ncan&#39;t be done, I&#39;m now saying I&#39;ll believe it when I see it...\n\n&quot;\nThink  of  it  another  way.   The  URI  namespace  consists  of  a\nhierarchy of  names  (collections).   COPY  and  MOVE  semantics  are\nnot  really  operations on  the  target  of  the  COPY  and  MOVE  --\nin  fact,  they  are  operations  on  the parent  collections  that\n&quot;own&quot;  the  origin  and  destination  namespaces. The  set  of  names\nwithin  a  collection  are  the  state  of  that  collection as  a\nresource.   If  you  want  to  make  these  operations  more\nREST-like, then  define  a  suitable  representation  of  a\ncollection  such  that  each namespace  can  be  GET-retrieved,\nmanipulated  at  the  user  agent,  and  then have  the  result  of\nthose  manipulations  communicated  to  the  two  namespaces in  such\na  way  that  they  can  achieve  the  new  state,  barring  conflicts,\nwithout  unnecessary  transfers  across  the  network.   This  one\nisn&#39;t  easy.\n&quot;\n\n...but honestly, Roy lost me there.  I&#39;ve been mulling this over for a\ncouple of days and I&#39;m not seeing it.  Anyone?\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
