In other words \n&quot;opacity&quot; is s=\r\nimply not required in order to be a reliable identifier, \nand Tim Berners-L=\r\nee is simply wrong to &quot;require&quot; this in semantic web:\n\n*URIs as reliable id=\r\nentifiers are not compromised by recognizing all \npast or predictable forms=\r\n, as long as all forms direct to the most \ncurrent resource that will actua=\r\nlly respond to the protocol in use.*\n\nThis is a very old point but one that=\r\n needs constant revisiting as so \nmany web services continue to have non-me=\r\nmorable non-generative URIs:\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Roy T. =\r\nFielding&quot; &lt;fielding@a...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; So, which method is more ReSTful?  =\r\nTo me the first one is ReSTful, \nthe\n&gt; &gt; second one isn&#39;t, but Mike obvious=\r\nly has been thinking about ReST \n&gt; &gt; longer\n&gt; &gt; than I have... so I accept =\r\nthat I&#39;m probably missing something.\n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe I am missing something, but=\r\n since several people have said \nthat\n&gt; REST implies opaqueness in the URI,=\r\n my guess is that a legend\n&gt; has somehow begun and I need to put it to rest=\r\n (no pun intended).\n&gt; \n&gt; REST does not require that a URI be opaque.  The o=\r\nnly place where\n&gt; the word opaque occurs in my dissertation is where I comp=\r\nlain about \nthe\n&gt; opaqueness of cookies.  In fact, RESTful applications are=\r\n, at all \ntimes,\n&gt; encouraged to use human-meaningful, hierarchical identif=\r\niers in \norder\n&gt; to maximize the serendipitous use of the information beyon=\r\nd what is\n&gt; anticipated by the original application.\n\nA point that simply n=\r\never seems to get raised about this is that \nopaque URIs simply cannot be r=\r\nemembered by human beings, accordingly \nthey cannot be rattled off during p=\r\nhone calls or radio shows or by \ntyping in, in the library.\n\nI have found g=\r\nenerative URNs such as those used at Wikipedia to be \nindispensible in any =\r\nserious online work.\n\nI have been forced to conclude that Tim Berners-Lee i=\r\ns simply WRONG, \nand that his priestly influence over the W3 cult has done =\r\na great deal \nof damage.\n\nI would invite a debate on this topic, a panel po=\r\nssibly, in which I \nwould crush TBL.  His absurd strong ontology conception=\r\ns of the \nSemantic Web are doing more damage to actually making it work, th=\r\nan \nany ten stupid bloggers out there...\n\nAlso there are these arguments:\nh=\r\nttp://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?OpacityMythsDebunked\n\nOh no!  I act=\r\nually read the name &quot;Opacity Myths Debunked&quot; in the name!\n\nI am damned... ;=\r\n-)\n\nAnother good example is the (in my opinion, correct) way that 360.\nyaho=\r\no.com handles its own URIs:\n\nhttp://360.yahoo.com/edit/feeds.html\nis easily=\r\n memorable since the domain name is the service, &quot;edit feeds&quot; \nis what I am=\r\n doing, and it is\nin HTML.  Ideally it would work also as\nhttp://360.yahoo.=\r\ncom/edit/feeds\nand even more ideally I&#39;d be able to do it third-person, per=\r\nhaps \nletting someone else edit &quot;for&quot; me\nhttp://360.yahoo.com/craighubleyca=\r\n/feeds (read them)\nhttp://360.yahoo.com/craighubleyca/edit/feeds (edit them=\r\n, if I&#39;ll let \nyou)\n\nCraig Hubley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
