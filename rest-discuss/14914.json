OTH, there will often be no 1:1 mapping between domain object (that&#39;s how I understood POJO) so if you use JAXB on your POJO you&#39;ll rather have a serialized domain object than &#39;resource representation&#39;\n&gt;\n\nWhen using JAX-RS, I&#39;m finding myself more and more often building a\nset of JAXB annotated classes that directly represent my resources,\nseparate from the classes that might represent my domain tier (with,\nperhaps, JPA or Hibernate annotations on them).  Besides the fact that\nthis means I don&#39;t have to write all of the boring serialization code,\nit has some other benefits:\n\n- Both XML and JSON serialization, nearly for free.\n\n- Ability to include properties for however I&#39;m going to represent\n  links (which don&#39;t belong in the domain model at all).\n\n- Ability to include properties for related resources (either individual\n  child beans or collections of them), for which JAXB does a\n  slick job of including as nested sub-elements, versus\n  entity beans that are typically associated with only one table.\n\n- Ability to write business logic that is natural to Java\n  developers used to beans oriented development,\n  independent of the fact that this resource was received\n  (or will be sent) across some HTTP or other transport.\n\n- Ablity to write much better unit and functional tests that can\n  reason about the resource model (independent of how the\n  resources got received from a client or synthesized from my\n  database domain objects), with all the usual\n  benefits of a strongly typed language (versus using\n  XPath or poking through some JSON data structure\n  with string based keys and hoping I spelled the keys right).\n\nIt&#39;s good stuff for Java developers.\n\nCraig\n\n"}}
