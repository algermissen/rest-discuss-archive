In that context I am very wary of\n&gt; : language that talks about two resources being the &quot;same&quot;, even if the\n&gt; : might happen to be equivalent for the forseeable future.\n&gt; Problem is, without that &quot;Sameness&quot;, there is no notion of identity\n&gt; at all, and no resource.  Everything is itself and perhaps something and\n&gt; everything else from time to time.*  Who can live in a universe like\n&gt; that?  You can&#39;t convict a murderer, because it was never him; it was\n&gt; someone else who happened to &quot;demarcate the same state&quot;...\n&gt; on that particular day.\n\nWell, you can&#39;t convict a resource. However you can put a proxy between\nthe resource and those who it might harm. The proxy could match requests\ndestined for http://example.com/thecriminal and treat them specially,\nfor example by rejecting them outright. If correspondance was still\npossible via http://example.com/thecriminal? you would need to match\nthat too, but you might also need to match\nhttp://example.com/thecriminalsbrother who is colluding with the\ncriminal to allow message exchanges to continue. Are the criminal and\nthe criminal&#39;s brother the same resource? No, though they are equivalent\nin this context for the problem the proxy is trying to solve. Are\nhttp://example.com/thecriminal and http://example.com/thecriminal? the\nsame resource? I would say no. One day the second resource might be\ndisabled when the bug that caused the urls to be handled equivalently is\nfixed. Then they will no longer necessarily require identical treatment.\n\nI don&#39;t go for the sameness of resources or urls. I think sameness is a\nconcept that only really applies to urns in spaces where a single urn\ncouldn&#39;t be specified for technical reasons. Even then, if they are\nequivalent... what purposes are they equivalent for? Can you guarantee\nthat they will be equivalent for every purpose I can conceive of? Same\nis too loose a concept for me. I can only really define it one way: Is\nthe identification either identical or defined by the scheme to be\nequivalent?\n\nSo in answer to your question, a resource identified by a particular url\nis the same as itself. That is all we need for the purposes of identity.\nFor other purposes we need more problem-specific concepts of equvalence\nto make statements that can be understood.\n\nBenjamin.\n\n\n"}}
