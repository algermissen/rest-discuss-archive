It usually falls  \nout very clearly what to do then.\n\nIn N3 you would write\n\n&lt;&gt; a :ShoppingCart;\n    :contains &lt;http://example.org/items/1342455&gt;;\n    :contains &lt;http://example.org/items/4365456&gt; .\n\nIf you feel it would be better to give the client somewhat more  \ninformation about your items, in order to avoid it having to make  \nanother http call, you could add that to the message with\n\n&lt;http://example.org/items/1342455&gt; a :Book;\n      :title &quot;Begriffsschrift&quot;;\n      :author &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frege#p&gt; .\n&lt;http://example.org/items/4365456&gt; a :CD;\n      :title &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;;\n      :band &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_floyd#b&gt; .\n\nThen since you want to be able to interact with as many clients as  \npossible, many of whome don&#39;t have good rdf tools, you would want to  \ncreate an xml crystallization of the rdf graph [1], so that they can  \nuse the simple DOM tools they have at their disposal.\n\nUsing rdf makes it much easier to define the vocabulary you are  \nworking with. You will probably find a good ontology that suits your  \nneeds allready out there. The rdf crystalisation is a little more  \ntricky, but not more tricky that creating good xml to start off with.\n\nHenry\n\n[1] http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/crystalizing_rdf\n\n\n\nOn 13 May 2007, at 00:32, Ittay Dror wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I want to take another stab at understanding the finer details of  \n&gt; good REST design. I first tried posting a question on the &#39;REST  \n&gt; intro slides&#39; thread, but got no response.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m trying to understand what is exactly good REST design, esp. the  \n&gt; &#39;hypermedia&#39;  part of it.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Take the case of the shopping cart. There are several ways to  \n&gt; implement it. Am I right in stating that:\n&gt;\n&gt; * &quot;REST-like&quot; implementation will return a representation of the  \n&gt; shopping cart as a list of catalog numbers of items:\n&gt;\n&gt;    &lt;shopping-cart&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;         &lt;items&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;             &lt;item&gt;1342455&lt;/item&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;             &lt;item&gt;4365456&lt;/item&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;         &lt;/items&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    &lt;/shopping-cart&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; * &quot;almost-REST&quot; implementation will return a list of URIs of the  \n&gt; items.\n&gt;\n&gt;    &lt;shopping-cart&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;         &lt;items&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;             &lt;item&gt;http://example.org/items/1342455&lt;/item&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;             &lt;item&gt;http://example.org/items/4365456&lt;/item&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;         &lt;/items&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    &lt;/shopping-cart&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; * REST implementation will return a list of links where the link  \n&gt; targets are the items\n&gt;\n&gt;    &lt;shopping-cart&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;         &lt;items&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;             &lt;item&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://example.org/items/1342455&quot;/&gt;&lt;/item&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;             &lt;item&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://example.org/items/4365456&quot;/&gt;&lt;/item&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;         &lt;/items&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    &lt;/shopping-cart&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; Ittay\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Ittay Dror\n&gt; Chief Architect,\n&gt; R&D, Qlusters Inc.\n&gt; Web: qlusters.com\n&gt; Email: ittayd@...\n&gt; Phone: +972-3-6081994\n&gt;\n&gt; openQRM - Data Center Provisioning\n&gt; ------\n&gt; I own this number: D0E008A921FF04A9DB8C12668E4315F4.
