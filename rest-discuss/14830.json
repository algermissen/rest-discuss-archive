I want to support\n&gt; this constraint by adding HATEOASfulness to my future applications. One\n&gt; thing I just do not understand so far about HATEOAS-via-HTTP is (and\n&gt; what other people asked me when citing Fielding in this issue): How a\n&gt; client shall actually know which http method to use to follow a link\n&gt; received with the previous request to a RESTful server? Roy answered in\n&gt; his blog that the method could be read out of the last result. But\n&gt; actually how?\n&gt; \n&gt; This information is part of the hypermedia semantics specified (media\n&gt; type specification or link relation specification etc). Such a\n&gt; specification can either explicitly state the method to use (see RFC\n&gt; 5023 for example) or specify a hypermedia element that tells the client\n&gt; at runtime what method to use (e.g. HTML forms).\n\nI understand that with AtomPub RFC5023 specifies that. Call me dumb, but\nwhat to do if I am not using AtomPub but self-made service (like a web shop\napplication)? How to do it then? For example, if I am writing a web shop, an\nthat one allows to place an order using a POST. How to tell a client that it\nshall use that POST? I mean, *where* to put that information in a technical\nsense?\n \n\n\n"}}
