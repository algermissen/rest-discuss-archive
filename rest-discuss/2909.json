There&#39;s the\n&gt; least variability in what that means, and the greatest wealth of\n&gt; toolkits to choose from that factor out most of the gritty details for\n&gt; you.  By and large REST interfaces don&#39;t tell you how to serialize and\n&gt; deserialize complex structures, so you kind of start from scratch \n&gt; every time. If they use a SOAP encoding, you get some of that. But \n&gt; there just is nothing simpler than saying &quot;Here&#39;s the XML-RPC \n&gt; interface, and some sample code in a few of the popular scripting \n&gt; languages.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; i see holes in just about every sentence of this but i wonder is it \n&gt; just me; i have nothing good to say about it so i&#39;ll shut up.\n\nLet me suggest the following theory about Dave&#39;s understanding of XML: \nhis only experience with the &quot;X&quot; in XML has been negative. People \nextended &quot;his&quot; RSS without his permission. This prevents him from seeing \nthe problem with using a bowlderized XML vocabulary with extremely poor \nsupport for independent extensibility. Nevertheless, until he \nunderstands this issue, the &quot;market&quot; for XML-RPC-based solutions will be \ninherently capped. People will deploy a few, say, &quot;yeah, that was fun \nand easy, but not extensible and scalable&quot; and will just leave to try \nsomething else. It is not a flaw that REST applications preserve all of \nthe flexibility of XML and even of MIME!\n\nXML-RPC cannot be used for anything as important as SMTP and HTTP while \nit has such a fixed and limited encoding. I can only presume that this \nis a major reason that so few reusable XML-RPC abstract service types \nhave arisen...or perhaps it is the lack of a service description \nlanguage. I&#39;m not sure.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
