Response codes are indeed\ndescribed by HTTP, that isn&#39;t the issue.  The issue is what response is\nissued to what request, and that isn&#39;t defined by media type.  My Atom\nProtocol implementation may respond 202 Accepted instead of 201 Created\nbecause I&#39;ve implemented moderation of new content.  Only my API can\ndescribe that authoritatively.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  A system&#39;s security implementation isn&#39;t described by its\n&gt; &gt; media types, so your API has to describe the use of HTTP Digest,\n&gt; &gt; user roles, and such.  Your API does this via hypertext --\n&gt; &gt; descriptive error\n&gt; &gt; responses with links instead of the default 4xx response message,\n&gt; &gt; for example.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I was referring to design time documentation, not runtime.\n&gt; \n\nI know you were.  But, a REST system combines self-descriptive\nmessaging with a self-documenting API.  You can write out-of-band\ndocumentation for it to your heart&#39;s content.  But that documentation\nought to be reflected at runtime, so I can know exactly how your system\nworks by stepping my way through it using curl or a protocol analyzer,\nwithout having to constantly refer to the design-time documentation.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
