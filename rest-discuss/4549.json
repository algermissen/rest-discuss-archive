Perhaps if your applications was re-phrased using &#39;resource&#39;\nrather than &#39;node&#39; and &#39;object&#39; I&#39;d be able to understand.\n\n&gt; Due to anonymity requirements, the originating node cannot know where all\n&gt; the pieces of an object are (for example, a query or a transaction), and\n&gt; nodes usually cannot know where the object originated.\nWhat is an &#39;originating node&#39;? Is that an HTTP client? To hide the location\nof the pieces, you have a single identifiable resource and clients don&#39;t\nknow what lays beyond.\n\n&gt; No, different hosts each holding their aspect of distributed objects is\n&gt; integral to the application.\nOkay, but how can you have different hosts holding aspects of a single\ndistributed object but not tell any client where those different aspects are\nlocated??\n\n&gt; A server hosts multiple nodes that each communicate with many neighbouring\n&gt; nodes (&quot;friends&quot; with which they can exchange IOUs).\nOkay - each &#39;node&#39; is a resource. Clients communicate with this &#39;public&#39;\nnode. Clients do not know about neighboring nodes. The resource is a type of\naggregating proxy for those other nodes.\n\n&gt; Nodes may also communicate with a strange node to pay or receive payment\nfrom that node.\nOkay - each &#39;node&#39; may also be a client and can transfer payment to other\nresources or request payment from other resources. In order to receive\nunsolicited transfers, a node needs to have an identifier and the sender of\npayment needs to know what that is.\n\n&gt; Payments are made by passing IOUs along paths connecting two strange nodes\nin the network of neighbours.\nAh... a chain of proxies... and this chain is used to obscure the legal\nentity requesting a transfer?\n\n\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Ryan Fugger&quot; &lt;rfugger@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;S.

Do you need to\n&gt; &gt; access the same host several times for performance and only switch hosts\n&gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt; reliability in the face of a host failure?\n&gt;\n&gt; No, different hosts each holding their aspect of distributed objects is\n&gt; integral to the application.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; It sounds like we should talk about what capabilities a single server is\n&gt; &gt; providing.\n&gt;\n&gt; A server hosts multiple nodes that each communicate with many neighbouring\n&gt; nodes (&quot;friends&quot; with which they can exchange IOUs).  Nodes may also\n&gt; communicate with a strange node to pay or receive payment from that node.\n&gt; Payments are made by passing IOUs along paths connecting two strange nodes\n&gt; in the network of neighbours.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; You may need a proxy that forwards requests to the current\n&gt; &gt; hosting server, or possibly returns a Location header with the &#39;new&#39;\n&gt; &gt; location.\n&gt;\n&gt; Since trust is such an integral issue with this application, there must be\n&gt; a mechanism to change any server that proves untrustworthy, including\n&gt; proxy servers.  Changing proxy servers then has all the same\n&gt; identifier-renaming problems as changing servers.\n&gt;\n&gt; Like I said, as hard as I&#39;ve tried to make it work, it just seems that\n&gt; REST is inappropriate for the application.  I&#39;m actually looking at\n&gt; bypassing HTTP altogether and using something like Jabber for persistent\n&gt; XML messaging sessions between servers.  Very unRESTful, I know, but it\n&gt; would be soooo appealingly simple...\n&gt;\n&gt; Ryan\n&gt;\n\n"}}
