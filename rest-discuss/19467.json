Running code has definitive\n&gt; behaviour: http://caniuse.com/\n&gt; \n\nREST is a defined architectural style.  The link you&#39;ve posted is all\nabout where a set of moving-goalpost features overlap at a moment in\ntime, which is hardly the same thing.  While system behavior may be\ndefinable, it&#39;s a by-product of the design process, as opposed to goals\nused to guide the design process.  What I mean by defined architecture\nwould be some sort of Taylor-school definition of just what&#39;s trying to\nbe accomplished, like REST was the model for the move to HTTP 1.1.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; What is it, specifically, that you feel may be about to render\n&gt; browsers infeasible as the basis for a RESTful system?\n&gt; \n\nSilent error correction, content sniffing being used as a reason to\ndeprecate Content-Type, any number of RFC 3986 violations -- we&#39;re\nclearly off into uncharted territory with little or no resemblance to\nREST, and I&#39;ve just scratched the surface.  What else to make of this\nmove to just not mention &quot;resource&quot; and redefine URIs to identify\neither documents or services?  How is it possible to be more anti-REST?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there anything missing that would make it feasible and if so why\n&gt; is it missing? e.g. why did the efforts to introduce PUT and DELETE\n&gt; to &lt;form&gt; fail?\n&gt; \n\nWhat&#39;s missing is browser-vendor knowledge of architecture, or any HTTP/\nURI interoperability issues not involving browsers.  I won&#39;t speculate\nas to why, it&#39;s not as if Roy didn&#39;t used to waste his breath explaining\nto these people the finer points of why ad-hoc changes to WebArch are\nshort-sighted.  Sufficient explanation to me of why no PUT, DELETE,\nXforms, list goes on -- not to mention feature removal...\n\nClearly, the future of REST no longer lies with the browser.  My status\nnowadays is &quot;on sabbatical&quot; to recover my health, after recently &quot;re-\nhoming&quot; the last of my clients -- that one since 1994 which is how long\nI&#39;ve been developing Web sites for consumption in browsers.  I have a 9-\nweek-old Alaskan Malamute to help me drop at least a couple stone before\nI return, may take a few years.\n\nI&#39;ll continue to participate here, but when I return to Web development\nit certainly looks like I&#39;ll be forsaking the browser for the native\napp, where I can continue to bring my clients positive returns on their\nonline investments by leveraging REST to deal with the realities of the\nnetowrk currently being denied by the browser vendors.\n\nShould be interesting to watch, but the &quot;new direction&quot; has caused me\nto pull my horse from the race; I no longer have any vested interest\nnor do I care about the future of browsers.  Only a sense that we&#39;ll be\ncleaning up the mess for a long time to come -- corporate production\ncycles, marketing imperatives, and bottom lines are no way to guide\nthe Web&#39;s architectural development, and this era can&#39;t end well.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
