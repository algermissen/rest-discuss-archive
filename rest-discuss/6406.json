What I&#39;ve implemented is XSLTC, here&#39;s an oversimplified\n&gt; overview, imagine each ;view= option as *.xsl, and realize they&#39;re all\n&gt; transforming the same Atom document and that the menu links are implemented\n&gt; in the XSLT file:\n&gt;\n&gt;  /resource;view=text &lt;-- text-only version of the resource\n&gt;  /resource;view=print &lt;-- content (including images) only no menus\n&gt;  /resource;view=edit &lt;-- like the print view except in a &lt;form&gt;\n\nThis is roughly how we dealt with it in the REST support in Ruby on\nRails. We just made the slight shortcut that have the URLs look like\n/resource;edit. For the pure text-only version, I&#39;d recommend using\nmime types in form of extensions, say /resource.txt. The ; part can\nthen be reserved for multiple representations of the same logical\nresources within the same mime type.\n--\nDavid Heinemeier Hansson\nhttp://www.loudthinking.com -- Broadcasting Brain\nhttp://www.basecamphq.com   -- Online project management\nhttp://www.backpackit.com   -- Personal information manager\nhttp://www.rubyonrails.com  -- Web-application framework\n\n\n\n"}}
