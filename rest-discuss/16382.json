Then there was no need for you to ask how &quot;self-descrip=\r\ntive\nmessaging works with opaque media type identifiers&quot;, since you already=\r\n\nknow.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;d be interested to understand exactly what you believe th=\r\ne costs of\n&gt;&gt; such identifiers are to self-descriptiveness, and what types =\r\nof\n&gt;&gt; layered/intermediary mechanism would be effected.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; No, I&#39;m not =\r\ngoing to rewrite Roy&#39;s thesis, which explains the benefits\n&gt; and tradeoffs =\r\nof the uniform interface in depth:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;REST enables intermediate processin=\r\ng by constraining messages to be\n&gt; self-descriptive: interaction is statele=\r\nss between requests, standard\n&gt; methods and media types are used to indicat=\r\ne semantics and exchange\n&gt; information, and responses explicitly indicate c=\r\nacheability.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Intermediate processing is _not_ enabled _except_ through=\r\n the use of\n&gt; stateless interactions consisting of standard methods and med=\r\nia types.\n&gt; The entire notion of anarchic scalability depends upon self-des=\r\ncriptive\n&gt; messaging, which by definition requires the use of standard medi=\r\na types,\n&gt; not just cache-control headers.\n\nWhere abouts does that explain =\r\nthe costs of emergent (bottom-up)\n&#39;standardisation&#39; vs. the strict (top-dow=\r\nn) way of doing it?\n\nIf the costs are marginal, then why bother with the pa=\r\nin and\ninefficiency associated with the latter? REST&#39;s position on this iss=\r\nue\ndepends massively on what you interpret from the word &#39;standard&#39;:\n\nhttp:=\r\n//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/standardised\n\n&quot;Designed in a standard manner _or_ =\r\naccording to an official standard.&quot;\n\nMy point of view is that standard medi=\r\na types would emerge naturally\nanyway without the need for a registry, not =\r\nthat REST is achievable\nwithout standard media types. I&#39;m trying to underst=\r\nand why you believe\nthis could not happen, and/or why it is not desirable.\n=\r\n\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You can&#39;t look something up without a registry? =A0Pro-tip:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; h=\r\nttp://www.google.com/search?q=3D%22application/hal%2Bxml%22\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; First of=\r\n all, please refer to RFC 4288. =A0Your syntax is that of the\n&gt; standards t=\r\nree, and will never be approved by IANA unless there&#39;s a\n&gt; corresponding RF=\r\nC. =A0You need to choose an appropriate tree, then take\n&gt; five whole minute=\r\ns out of your day to register your identifier. =A0Why is\n&gt; this such an ins=\r\nurmountable obstacle, that using Google is preferable?\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, you can loo=\r\nk anything up on Google, but Google isn&#39;t a registry,\n&gt; and a registry is r=\r\nequired to avoid collisions where multiple parties\n&gt; are using the same ide=\r\nntifier for wildly different purposes. =A0Google\n&gt; can&#39;t keep anyone else f=\r\nrom using your identifier for another purpose.\n&gt; The IANA registry exists f=\r\nor exactly that reason.\n\nIn such a system it would be highly unlikely for t=\r\nwo media types with\nthe same identifier to emerge to a level of &#39;standardis=\r\nation&#39;\nsimultaneously.. maybe future REST systems should look to use URIs t=\r\no\nidentify media types and dereference specs, therefore avoiding this\nrisk =\r\naltogether?\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If crawlers were to provide a pagerank equivalent for me=\r\ndia types,\n&gt;&gt; according to public usage, could we do away with the registry=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; altogether? If not, why not?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; You&#39;re free to suggest any new mech=\r\nanism as a successor to the IANA\n&gt; registry. =A0But, in the real world of t=\r\noday, if you&#39;re using HTTP, NO,\n&gt; you can&#39;t do away with the IANA registry =\r\nbecause it&#39;s an integral part\n&gt; of the protocol. =A0Such suggestions are on=\r\nly relevant to discussions of\n&gt; successor protocols, like HTTP 2 or Waka.\n\n=\r\nOk, thanks.. I&#39;m discussing REST, though. Funnily enough.\n\n&gt; But, I think t=\r\nhat&#39;s a horrible idea, since it does nothing to avoid\n&gt; collisions -- only =\r\nallows a set-in-stone identifier&#39;s meaning to change\n&gt; over time according =\r\nto the whims of the mob. =A0Such anarchy is not\n&gt; conducive to the goals of=\r\n a uniform interface, and is certainly at odds\n&gt; with the long-term stabili=\r\nty that&#39;s a goal of REST.\n\nYou seriously think &quot;the mob&quot; (constituents of t=\r\nhe system, and those\nbaring the cost) are likely to create or allow those s=\r\norts of\ndestabilizing changes?\n\n&gt; The self-descriptive messaging constraint=\r\n of REST _cannot_ be met in\n&gt; HTTP over the Internet, _unless_ the media ty=\r\npe is IANA-registered. =A0BY\n&gt; DEFINITION. =A0No amount of arguing with me =\r\ncan change this reality...\n&gt; Unless of course there&#39;s something wrong with =\r\nmy grasp of plain English:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;REST enables intermediate processing by con=\r\nstraining messages to be\n&gt; self-descriptive... STANDARD MEDIA TYPES are use=\r\nd to indicate semantics\n&gt; and exchange information...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Seriously, peopl=\r\ne, what part of that am I somehow getting wrong? =A0How\n&gt; else can one iden=\r\ntify what STANDARD MEDIA TYPE is used, except through\n&gt; the IANA registry w=\r\nhich correlates identifiers to media types, which is\n&gt; the only mechanism H=\r\nTTP defines to determine the media type from any\n&gt; identifier sent over the=\r\n Internet?\n&gt;\n\nBecause in REST terms it depends on what you mean by &#39;standar=\r\nd&#39; and in\npractical HTTP terms, even though it conflicts with spec, there a=\r\nre\nother less formal ways of standardising a type that _will_ be used\nbecau=\r\nse they work and don&#39;t present any major issues.\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n"}}
