By saying &quot;between them&quot; you&#39;ve opened the\n&gt; &gt; door for me to add hypertext that links the documents externally. In\n&gt; &gt; other words I&#39;m now allowed to use the tool I&#39;m supposed to compare.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry, &quot;without links to them.&quot; \n\nOh, I see. We&#39;re back to &quot;Java can&#39;t implement this solution unless you\nuse Java.&quot;\n\n&gt; ... Bottom line, Paul --- although everything on the Web *can* be linked to,\n&gt; not everything is.  Yet everything that is nameable by a URI --- regardless of whether it has inbound or\n&gt; outbound links in some hyperstructure --- is still part of &quot;the Web.&quot;\n\nHow do we find things that are part of the Web but not hyperlinked? You\nsay by working with names. But that only works a tiny, tiny, tiny\nfraction of the time. Most of the time you can&#39;t find things by guessing\nat their names. That only works when you have an agreement with the\nwebsite author. Why wouldn&#39;t they express that agreement through\nhypertext (which is already deployed) rather than a generative grammar\nlanguage (which isn&#39;t)? I&#39;m still waiting for a use case.\n\nIf you invent a generative grammar language for the Web, I will write a\nCGI program that allows generative grammars to generate hypertext\ndocuments so that the Web subsumes that functionality *through\nhypertext*.\n\n&gt; ...  It seems\n&gt; to me that, by itself, HTTP is the application, not XML or HTML.  It seems to me, after months of\n&gt; consideration, that the problem with Roy&#39;s formulation of REST is not that it is too constraining but rather\n&gt; that it is *not constraining enough* --- it fails to separate the concerns of generic resource modeling and\n&gt; representational state transfer from the concerns of a particular kind of state that might be transferred,\n&gt; i.e. hypermedia.  But that&#39;s a later argument.\n\nIf we define hypertext as &quot;text with links&quot; then it becomes clear that\nanything you can represent with plan 9 namespaces I can represent with\ntext with links. The only question is whether the system is closed over\nhypertext or closed over namespaces or neither. If we obey the opacity\nprinciple then it will become closed over hypertext because things\nwithout links to them would by definition not be on the Web. But thanks\nto query parameters and URIs the set of things with links to them is\ninfinite.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; Yes, you are reduced to &quot;hacking&quot; in this case --- *because* of opacity.  \n\nNo, I&#39;m reduced to hacking because I&#39;m trying to get access to\ninformation (the listing of files) that was not provided to me. If it is\nprovided to me as hypertext or a generative grammar I am equally able to\nget access to it.\n\n&gt; ... (The limitation to being the\n&gt; spider writer should&#39;ve been clear in the original problem statement.)  Dispensing with opacity and\n&gt; introducing explicit information about organizational schemes and the specific semantics of structured names\n&gt; elevates that activity to something more disciplined.\n\nOkay you&#39;re the spider writer. I&#39;ve just put ten .gif files on my\nwebsite. Really. To help you along I put your first name in their file\nnames. Go find them. (Please don&#39;t brute force my service provider.) If\nyou show me how to solve the problem with namespaces I&#39;ll show you how\nto do it with hypertext.\n\nEither the webiste owner is working with you or not. If they are not\nworking with you then there is no reason to believe the names will be\nconsistent because *they own the server side namespace and can name the\ngraphics whatever they want*. That isn&#39;t unique to the Web. Every\noperating system I&#39;ve ever used allows you to name things more or less\nwhatever you want. Every programming language I&#39;ve ever used allows you\nto name things more or less whatever you want. Are you saying the Web\nshould enforce predictable names?\n\nIf they are working with you then the tried and true and 100% effective\nway for them to do so is to provide hypertext (either static or dynamic)\nthat provides access to the documents.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
