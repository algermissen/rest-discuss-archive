My understanding is that it extends\n&gt; HTTP, so I believe a good approach would be to build a REST toolkit based on\n&gt; HTTP and layer an application framework on top of it that supplies WebDAV-based\n&gt; authoring.  \n\nMy point is that WebDAV seems more &quot;reusable&quot; than just for authoring\njust as HTTP is more reusable than just for web pages.\n\n&gt; .... But like you, I have less knowledge about WebDAV than I do about\n&gt; HTTP, and wish I had more.\n\nThere should be a WebDAV tutorial or book.\n\n&gt; Actually, Paul, I think I was with you at an XML conference done by DataChannel\n&gt; in San Jose back in 1999.  We were in a WebDAV workshop, but I can&#39;t remember\n&gt; who conducted it.  Jim Whitehead maybe?\n\nYep, Jim. One of the points he made was that WebDAV is sort of the\nuber-protocol and could replace FTP, many uses of NNTP, SMTP, etc. In\nother words what I might call the &quot;strong REST hypothesis&quot;. But I didn&#39;t\ncatch the significance then. I also recall that he was very suspicious\nof XML RPC protocols and I was ambivalent back then.\n\nAlso, I just coincidentally read a message where he said:\n\n&quot;I think we would have created far more problems for ourselves if we had\ntried to bite off the problem of creating a general-purpose remote\nproceedure call marshalling syntax.  Since there are currently several\ncompeting proposals in this space, and given their dependency on XML\nefforts\nto add data typing to XML, I think it was a wise decision to not base\nour\nefforts on these other efforts, since it allows us to finish before,\nsay,\nthe year 2002.&quot;\n\nAnother good prediction!\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
