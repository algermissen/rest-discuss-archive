But it still feels weak.\n\nAn other possibility is to create a new method, like &quot;META&quot;. With a  \nnew method,\n\n\tGET /foo/map/size \t\tRefers to the key &quot;size&quot; and\n\tMETA /foo/map/size \tRefers to the size of a map.\n\nBut, I&#39;ve not seen creating new HTTP methods proposed as a solution  \nto anything on this list. Do the list members have a disinclination  \nto do that? Sure, you lose the  caching you might get with GET, but  \nthat did not kill PROPFIND.\n\nFor my own part, creating new methods seems like a slippery slope,  \nand we certainly don&#39;t want a proliferation of new methods  as a  \nsolution to every problem. However, WebDAV&#39;s new methods didn&#39;t open  \nthe gates of hell, so perhaps there is room for a few more.  I  \nsuspect that it would be better to create a new method than to  \noverload and abuse old ones.\n\neric.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
