(in the sense of it not being respectful of the \n&gt; constraints of the =\r\nstyle and thus sacrificing some beneficial properties like \n&gt; scalability, =\r\nevolvability, etc.)\n&gt; \n&gt; My proposition:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. If this is not RESTful, we=\r\n&#39;ll have to talk.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. If this is RESTful, we need to be really careful =\r\nwhen we say there&#39;s no \n&gt; &quot;design time&quot; in RESTful systems. \n&gt; \n&gt; I think t=\r\nhe clearer statement is that &quot;static code generation&quot; (e.g. client \n&gt; stubs=\r\n) is discouraged in properly RESTful systems, since it tends towards \n&gt; suc=\r\nktacular rigidity in the user agent.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers\n&gt; Stu\n&gt;\n\nStu,\n\nThe amount =\r\nof runtime flexibility depends on the hypermedia controls that are availabl=\r\ne. For example, if there were no links or forms in HTML, then the browser (=\r\nor the user) would be bound to the interface specifics of every service out=\r\n there.\n\nA hypermedia control is only partially a data construct. A control=\r\n is instantiated as the result of client processing of the data. If a clien=\r\nt does not (or cannot) interpret &lt;form&gt; as a control then you lose the runt=\r\nime flexibility that that control provides.\n\nA developer can make up for th=\r\nat by interpreting the control themselves and coding the knowledge in the c=\r\nlient, but then as you say, they are turning a runtime binding into a desig=\r\nn-time binding.\n\nHTML and it&#39;s controls are primarily designed for browsers=\r\n presenting information to humans. It has some features like &lt;link&gt; and rel=\r\n that target alternate, machine-driven clients but the language is not powe=\r\nrful enough to provide equivalent machine controls for every human control =\r\nexpressible in the language.\n\nI believe that it is possible to build machin=\r\ne controls that provide much more run time flexibility than is afforded mac=\r\nhines by HTML. I always point to CCXML as an example of this. I suspect, ho=\r\nwever, that the more powerful machine controls are, the more they must targ=\r\net specific types of machines. I think the whole area needs more investigat=\r\nion though.\n\nIn short, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a question of RESTful vs. not RES=\r\nTful. I think you are simply noting that the degree of runtime flexibility =\r\nafforded to the system is a function of both the hypermedia format *and* th=\r\ne client.\n\nRegards,\n\nAndrew\n\n\n"}}
