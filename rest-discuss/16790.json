In the linked email, Roy\n&gt; refers to the client&#39;s incarnation of the application as &quot;hypermedia\n&gt; workspace&quot;.\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;m not a big fan of that term.  I think it&#39;s more common, and\nunderstandable, to refer to application state (client) vs. resource\nstate (server).  Those learning REST typically conflate the two, or\nassume that a REST application is the server-side system rather than\nthe user interface.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
