I \ngave my own personal interpretation in the example, I think it \ndeviates from Walter&#39;s intention. I found this piece written by him \nthat you might find interesting:\n&lt;http://ibiblio.org/bosak/conf/xmldev99/perry.htm&gt;\n\n&gt; Let&#39;s say we did that - how would the (automated) client know what \n&gt; parts of the template to modify?\n&gt; If we had XML, we could use XPath or something. Then the XML could \n&gt; change as long as the XPath used didn&#39;t need to change.\n\nYes, that&#39;s one way of doing it. Let&#39;s say I set the part id at XPath:\n/order/orderline[i]/part-ref\nand the quantity at:\n/order/orderline[i]/quantity\n\nOr just walk the tree until I find &#39;part-ref&#39; or &#39;part-id&#39; or &#39;part*&#39; \nand keep a record of the nodes traversed and then make the XPath on \nthe fly and set the part id there. I think in Walter&#39;s approach the \nserver side would do such piecing the data together from the input it \nreceives.\n\n&gt; I&#39;d like to hear more of how this would work... I&#39;m somewhat \n&gt; tangled up in\n&gt; the world of PO/PO-ACK/etc. right now, so this is interesting to me.\n\nI just threw the idea out to see what people thought. I&#39;m not really \nsure on implementation details, or if what I described is really \nfeasible.\n\nRegards,\nRobert McKinnon\n\n\n\n"}}
