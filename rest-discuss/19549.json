DELE=\r\nTE means\n&gt; DELETE, it cannot mean &#39;unpublish the the source resource&#39;.\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, those methods have a general meaning within the uniform\n&gt; interfa=\r\nce of HTTP whose purpose is to add to the self-descriptiveness\n&gt; of message=\r\ns and, in doing so, to afford intermediation across the\n&gt; system (e.g. web =\r\ncaching). The HTTP method definitions attribute\n&gt; meaning designed for this=\r\n purpose (e.g. establishing safety,\n&gt; idempotency, cacheability, etc).\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nProvided the link relations are not in conflict with the HTTP\n&gt; definitions=\r\n, and are merely qualifying the details of methods within\n&gt; the context of =\r\na given transition, then it is wrong to think about\n&gt; that in terms of &quot;red=\r\nefinition&quot;. It&#39;s qualification.\n&gt;\n&gt; In practice, it&#39;s much easier for consu=\r\nming parties if your\n&gt; documentation is specific by providing an explicit d=\r\nescription of the\n&gt; meaning and structure of the various requests possible =\r\nover a given\n&gt; link. Leaving your documentation so abstract that the reader=\r\n is left\n&gt; with the task of inferring every part of each possible request d=\r\noes\n&gt; not seem like a very pragmatic approach for custom link relations (bu=\r\nt\n&gt; may be more appropriate for standardised link relations).\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you =\r\nfind yourself in a situation that you absolutely must tell the\n&gt; client dev=\r\neloper this, rephrase the hypermedia semantic (here: the link rel\n&gt; spec).\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There is nothing to say againts hints regarding the intended &#39;canon=\r\nical&#39;\n&gt; use case but I can always only be a hint.

Provided that visibility is not impacted (i.e=\r\n. a link\n&gt; rel&#39;s qualification of a method doesn&#39;t _conflict_ with HTTP&#39;s) =\r\nthen\n&gt; how does this have any bearing on the &quot;RESTfulness&quot; of the\n&gt; applica=\r\ntion?\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; M\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;\n\r\n--089e013d1a0cdd58a804eac3758d\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I will say that i&#39;ve gone both routes (using rels to i=\r\nndicate relationships and using rels to indicate actions) and am not settle=\r\nd on either.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style&gt;the &quot;rel&quot; community def. wa=\r\nnts to see this attribute used to indicate relationships. reviews of =A0rec=\r\nently registered values at the IANA show this.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div style&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div style&gt;however, i can see the appeal and value of having action indicat=\r\nors on hypermedia controls; esp. in cases where machines are doing the work=\r\n of selecting controls to activate. in this case it seems efficient to redu=\r\nce the &quot;decision distance&quot; of 1) find the control that has an id =\r\nof the desired target then, 2) look at the control to see what protocol act=\r\nion is available to 1) find the control that has the id of the desired acti=\r\non of the target.

Which translate with a PUT to the target href (the target feed =\r\nentry).&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In other words, what is the best practi=\r\nce to express hypermedia actions in a RESTful way, to allow consumer to con=\r\ntrol the workflow while the server controls the affordances of the user (ba=\r\nsed on internal application state)?&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Phil&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;br&gt;Le 8 nov. 2013 =E0 02:58, Mike Kelly &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:mikekell=\r\ny321@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mikekelly321@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; a =E9crit=\r\n=A0:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote type=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span&gt;=A0&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;h5&quot;&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      \n      \n    =\r\n  &lt;p&gt;On Fri, Nov 8, 2013 at 1:31 AM, Jan Algermissen&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mai=\r\nlto:jan.algermissen@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;jan.algermissen@...=\r\nm&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Hi Mike,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; On 08.11.2013, at 02:0=\r\n8, mike amundsen &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:mamund@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;=\r\nmamund@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; not sure=\r\n i understand the Q, but i&#39;ll offer this:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; rel=\r\n=3D&quot;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://example.com/rels/publisher&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ht=\r\ntp://example.com/rels/publisher&lt;/a&gt;&quot; describes the relationship betwee=\r\nn the source and the target.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I like to try t=\r\no emphasize what the target is *to the source* with the goal that the appli=\r\ncation-level effect of the HTTP methods falls into place.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n This IMO helps a great deal with avoiding to layer specialized application=\r\n protocols on top of HTTP (which already is the application protocol).&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; IOW, it helps prevent redefinitions of the meaning of HTTP me=\r\nthods.  POST means POST, it cannot mean &#39;publish the source resource&#3=\r\n9;. DELETE means DELETE, it cannot mean &#39;unpublish the the source resou=\r\nrce&#39;.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWell, those methods have a general meaning w=\r\nithin the uniform&lt;br&gt;\ninterface of HTTP whose purpose is to add to the self=\r\n-descriptiveness&lt;br&gt;\nof messages and, in doing so, to afford intermediation=\r\n across the&lt;br&gt;\nsystem (e.g. web caching). The HTTP method definitions attr=\r\nibute&lt;br&gt;\nmeaning designed for this purpose (e.g. establishing safety,&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nidempotency, cacheability, etc).&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nProvided the link relations are n=\r\not in conflict with the HTTP&lt;br&gt;\ndefinitions, and are merely qualifying the=\r\n details of methods within&lt;br&gt;\nthe context of a given transition, then it i=\r\ns wrong to think about&lt;br&gt;\nthat in terms of &quot;redefinition&quot;. It&#3=\r\n9;s qualification.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIn practice, it&#39;s much easier for consuming=\r\n parties if your&lt;br&gt;\ndocumentation is specific by providing an explicit des=\r\ncription of the&lt;br&gt;\nmeaning and structure of the various requests possible =\r\nover a given&lt;br&gt;\nlink. Leaving your documentation so abstract that the read=\r\ner is left&lt;br&gt;\nwith the task of inferring every part of each possible reque=\r\nst does&lt;br&gt;\nnot seem like a very pragmatic approach for custom link relatio=\r\nns (but&lt;br&gt;\nmay be more appropriate for standardised link relations).&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; If you find yourself in a situation that you absolutely must tell =\r\nthe client developer this, rephrase the hypermedia semantic (here: the link=\r\n rel spec).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; There is nothing to say againts hints regardi=\r\nng the intended &#39;canonical&#39; use case but I can always only be a hin=\r\nt. AtomPub is an example, where the spec tells us so much about the interac=\r\ntions between client and server that it looks like a protocol when it is ac=\r\ntually only hints about a canonical application flow. Focussing on resource=\r\n semantics would have been much nicer, IMHO.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; One simpl=\r\ny cannot constrain HTTP servers that way and still have REST.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe importance of HTTP methods from a REST point of view is that they&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\ncreate **some** visibility of the client server interactions, so that&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nthe messages can be understood to _a certain extent_ by&lt;br&gt;\nintermediari=\r\nes. Provided that visibility is not impacted (i.e. a link&lt;br&gt;\nrel&#39;s qua=\r\nlification of a method doesn&#39;t _conflict_ with HTTP&#39;s)  then&lt;br&gt;\nho=\r\nw does this have any bearing on the &quot;RESTfulness&quot; of the&lt;br&gt;\nappl=\r\nication?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nCheers,&lt;br&gt;\nM&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n    &lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#fff;min-height:0&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/=\r\nblockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\r\n--089e013d1a0cdd58a804eac3758d--\r\n\n"}}
