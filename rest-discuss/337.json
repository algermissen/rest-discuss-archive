The reciever\n&gt; &gt; should use the message-id to recognize repeat\n&gt; &gt; sends and deliver once to the user.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Scanning the SMTP spec, I don&#39;t see anything about message ids. The word\n&gt; &quot;message-id&quot; is never mentioned once. The word &quot;retry&quot; is never\n&gt; mentioned.\n\nI am looking at RFC2821.  It has a whole section\non &quot;Retry stratgies.&quot;  Message-id is covered in\nRFC2822.  The spec does not explicitly cover using\nmessage-ids in retry context, but SMTP agents may\nobviously use it for exactly this purpose.\n\n&gt; &gt; Does something magical happen when some content\n&gt; &gt; moves from the body to the url?\n&gt;\n&gt; That should be obvious. When you move content to the URL, the compound\n&gt; URL becomes addressable:\n&gt;\n&gt;  * http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=&quot;Paul+Comstock&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; versus\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Go to http://www.google.com/ Type in Paul Constock. Hit Enter.&quot;\n\nThat is a user interface convention.  By that\nargument, is I urlencoded XML-RPC and passed it in\nthe qu&#92;ery string, it would no longer be RPC.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
