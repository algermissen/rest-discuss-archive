In the case of the queue example, presumably the\nposition in the queue would be a property of the relationship\nresource?\n\nIt would be nice to be able to delete, add or update ranges in the\ncollections in a single request, but I can&#39;t see how to do this via\nthe uniform interface in a clean way.\n\nCheers,\n\nJim\n\n"}}
