You&#39;d simply\n&gt;&gt; POST to the specific, primitive resources.\n&gt;\n&gt; Let&#39;s try to re-model the use case based on your solution:\n\n&gt; Comments?\n\nToydi, \n\nThe model looks OK to me. But since I don&#39;t know the context of your\neffort, it may not really be OK.\n\n\n&gt; But we still overload Payment-Acceptor&#39;s POST with two &quot;functionally&quot;\n&gt; distinct tasks (i.e. accept invoice number, accept cash payment\n&gt; amount). OTOH, we can argue there is only one &quot;logical&quot; task (i.e.\n&gt; both change the payment status).\n\nThe question here is how far are you going to do decomposition?\nThere is a point where further decomposition simply is not worth the\ntrouble. \n\nIf you were asked to model a car, would you model it down to the\nsubatomic level? If it is to be used by physicsts interested in how\ntwo adjacent quarks, one from the windshield and one from the\nsurrounding frame, interact, then sure you would. If it is to be used\nin a automobile dealership, sure you wouldn&#39;t.\n\n&gt; Does such overload POST allowed in HTTP/1.1 and align with Mark&#39;s\n&gt; abstract model?\n\nI don&#39;t know if you are treating invoice-as-payment any differently\nthan cash-as-payment. How about if paid by IOU (informal invoice)? By\ncredit card? How important is the type of the credit card? Is paying\nwith AMEX credit card result in different behaviour than if paying\nwith a VISA credit card? The list goes on. \n\nSo, if you still feel there is POST overloading, simply decompose\nfurther as necessary.\n\n\nYours,\nYS.\n\n\n\n"}}
