That being said...\n\nI don&#39;t understand why compression is bad for latency, though.  I cache\ncompressed data, and unzip it on the fly, so the expensive zip operation\nis only done once by the server each time the resource is updated. Which\nmeans the only user who experiences zip latency, is the user who updates\nthe resource -- but does another second (if that) get perceived by the\nuser on PUT/POST/PATCH operations, and is there any real benefit to\noptimizing these operations when GET is only like a billion times more\ncommon a request method?  I think not.\n\nAre mobile clients still so underpowered that their zip/unzip latency\nexceeds the transfer gains?  Especially if we&#39;re talking about\nmanipulating resources and updating representations using one single-\npacket-each-way round trip, double especially if we&#39;re talking about\nusers who are, you know, *mobile*.  If the client is moving from one\naccess point to another, caching the bulk of the data on the client and\nusing single-packet messaging is guaranteed to avoid the huge latency\nhit of changing IP address/routing while manipulating a resource, which\nseems to me like a huge gain in user-perceived performance.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
