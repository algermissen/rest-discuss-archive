I think Mike is\noverestimating, but that is another mail.\n\nEven if Mike is correct, you are looking at at\nleast an order of magnitude difference in\ndeployment costs between the two systems.\n\nNote: In theory one could implement an HTTPd using\nan event loop/queue (e.g. Medusa), in practice one\ndoesn&#39;t and the rest of the HTTP infrastructure\ndoesn&#39;t really support this scale.\n\n&gt; &gt; If I were doing asynch, I would much rather reuse\n&gt; &gt; the very well tested and widely deployed SMTP\n&gt; &gt; infrastructure than a new HTTP infrastructure.\n&gt;\n&gt; Me to.  But no new HTTP infrastructure is needed, really.\n\n!!!!What is most of the recent discussion about!?\nIn contrast, here is a short version of &quot;reliable\ndelivery&quot; using SMTP:\n\n   Send the message to the address using SMTP.\n\nHere is a short version of asynchronous callbacks\nusing SMTP:\n\n   Send the message to the reply-to address using SMTP\n\nContrast this with all of Pauls various specs.\n\n&gt; &gt; For the basic terrorist_or_not.com, HTTP is a\n&gt; &gt; great protocol, but, as we have seen, REST\n&gt; &gt; is not.\n&gt;\n&gt; You want to run that through by me again?  REST is the overall architectural\n&gt; style of HTTP.  I don&#39;t see how you distinguish the two.\n\nTerrorist_or_not.com uses RPC to deliver the\nqueries.  The target of the POST is a function not\na resource.\n\nI think the format of the POST should me\nmultipart/form-data.  XML-RPC folks prefer XML-RPC\nand SOAP people prefer SOAP envelopes.\nThese are all RPC.\n\nNo one here has given a persuasive non-RPC version\nof the application.\n\n&gt; &gt; For many applications, RPC (over HTTP) makes\n&gt; &gt; sense, but REST does not.\n&gt;\n&gt; It only makes sense because you don&#39;t understand REST yet. ;-)\n\nI think I understand REST.  I&#39;m not sure you do :-).\nIf you do, explain how to make\nterrorist_or_not.com non-RPC and why it would be\nbetter that way.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
