The SOAP elements are still\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the canonical address for the referenced object, not the URI. The URI is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; more or less ignored.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I disagree.\n\nMike, I know you didn&#39;t write any of this but you did write the\nstatement that started the whole debate was that you could use HTTP\ndispatching to dispatch based on URI and then have the addressing\ninformation redundantly stored in the SOAP message for a SOAP processor.\nI couldn&#39;t state clearly why I thought this was not helpful but now I\ncan.\n\nLet&#39;s say you are trying to write &quot;update bank account&quot; and it takes a\nbank account number and an amount of money. The REST argument is that\nyou should use standards as much as possible. So you want to use a\nstandard addressing mechanism, standardized method names/semantics and,\nif possible, a standardized information representation. The reason we\nuse standards is to minimize the amount of a priori knowledge necessary\nto invoke a service.\n\nMoving addressing information like &quot;which account number&quot; from the SOAP\nbody to the URI reduces the amount you have to know to work with a bank\naccount. Someone can just hand you a URI and you don&#39;t even need to know\nthat bank accounts or numbered, or that savings accounts and chequing\naccounts form different namespaces or that the bank has two subsidiaries\nwith their own numbering system or ... It&#39;s all one namespace.\n\nIf you must put the information both in the SOAP body and the URI then\nwe&#39;ve *increased* the amount of a priori knowledge required. Now you\nhave to know to do X *and* Y. Sam&#39;s URI demonstrates that even without\nthis extra burden, SOAP already requires you to jump through many &quot;a\npriori knowledge&quot; hoops. To invoke the right operation you must know:\n\n * whether or not there is a SOAPAction. \n * if there is, what it&#39;s value is (there are a variety of conventions)\n * what namespace to use for the operation element\n * what element type to use for the operation\n * what endpoint URI to use\n\nAnd some of these are only applicable to the HTTP transport so if you\nare using another transport then you have other magic cookies to\nprovide. I&#39;ve never heard why SOAP needs so many magic incantations when\nXML-RPC gets away with URI and method name and you could move even the\nmethod name into the URI (whether or not you believe in REST). But if\nyou moved the method name into the URI then SOAP would be a web-centric\nprotocol instead of a protocol that uses the Web as a transport.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
