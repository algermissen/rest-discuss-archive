The Accept request header helps you not ne=\r\ned  \nto, but does not prevent it.\n\nOf course, it is fine for your hypertext=\r\n documents to provide media  \ntype metadata as well, but it is likely to no=\r\nt be necessary.  In what  \nway are you saying that you would specify it and=\r\n how would you expect  \nclients to use it?\n\nWith proper use of the Vary hea=\r\nder, correct clients can still cache  \ncontent-negotiated representations o=\r\nf images in various formats so you  \nmay not need separate URIs for separat=\r\ne formats.  However, IE6 is not  \ncorrect in that regard -- so your choice =\r\nwill depend on which clients  \nyou care to support.\n\n-Justin\n\n\n\n\nOn Oct 6, =\r\n2008, at 6:34 PM, Beno=EEt Fleury wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; I have a question regar=\r\nding the Accept HTTP header. From the HTTP  \n&gt; spec I read &quot;The Accept requ=\r\nest-header field can be used to specify  \n&gt; certain media types which are a=\r\ncceptable for the response.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Does it mean it&#39;s not recommended to adapt=\r\n the content a priori. For  \n&gt; example, I have two resources:\n&gt; \t=95 an XML=\r\n document that references an image\n&gt; \t=95 the image in multiple formats (jp=\r\neg, png, gif)\n&gt; For different reasons (e.g. caching), I would like to have =\r\nstatic  \n&gt; URLs for the images. Therefore, the type of image to return to t=\r\nhe  \n&gt; client should be decided when the client request the XML document to=\r\n  \n&gt; point to the correct image type.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is it acceptable to specify the l=\r\nist of supported image formats  \n&gt; during the first request (XML document f=\r\netch)? Do you see any reason  \n&gt; I should not do that?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt;\n&gt; Beno=\r\nit\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
