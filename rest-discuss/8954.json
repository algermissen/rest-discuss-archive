On thinking about this, it *seems* to me that the semantics of \nAllow are much more about what methods can be performed on a resource \nthan what semantics can be performed on a resource by a given user.\n\nSo if we have, say, guest and resource-owner users and the former can \nonly GET while the latter can GET and PUT the Allow header should always \nbe Allow: GET, PUT and the following responses must be generated:\n\n           Guest     Owner\nGET       2xx/3xx   2xx/3xx\nPUT       401       2xx\nPOST      405       405\nFOO       405       405\n\nNote that while Allow: is optional with most responses it&#39;s mandatory \nwith 405s.\n\nIf you need more information about who can do what than this it should \nprobably be expressed in an entity.\n\n\n"}}
