So \nsuppose you enter a application for &quot;creating things&quot;, using a well-know \nURI. That URI returns to you a page (the representation of that resource \nin that stage of the application) with several links pointing to other \nresources, like &quot;create A&quot; with link to a resource that will create \nobject of type A, same for B and so on.\n\nWhen you follow say, the linkToA, the server will send you back a \nrepresentation with the fields that are needed for A, as well the URI \nwhere to post it.\n\nThat way, you don&#39;t have to have &quot;previous knowledge&quot; as each time the \nserver drives you to what is needed.\n\nThat should be driven as well by the media-types, I think, but I&#39;m not \nsure how that should be done, if it should be defined in the same \nrepresentation the server sent you or the client has to know already \nwhat media-type is dealing with.\n\nHope it helps.\n\n\n\nFelipe Ga�cho wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt; ok,\n&gt;\n&gt; I amusing &quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot; as my media type when I \n&gt; create resources in the server.. it works, nice and easy...\n&gt;\n&gt; The question is: how the client knows what parameters it should submit \n&gt; to the server to create a new resource ?\n&gt;\n&gt; is it a &quot;previous knowledge&quot; ?\n&gt;\n&gt; In the case of AtomPub, there is a generic type used to create \n&gt; resources.. it is always the same type navigating between the client \n&gt; and the server.. but in case I want to use different types, how to \n&gt; inform the client about the form contents ?\n&gt;\n&gt; * I am in this learning curve here, so please understand and help if I \n&gt; am just getting out of the curve :)\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
