Really, the only valid responses of\n&gt; &#39;Expect: 100-continue&#39; is &#39;417 Expectation Failed&#39; and &#39;100\n&gt; Continue&#39;. It can&#39;t be used for preauthentication.\n\nYes it can, that&#39;s one of the the things is was designed for.\n\nFrom 8.2.3,\n\n  The purpose of the 100 (Continue) status (see section 10.1.1) is to\n  allow a client that is sending a request message with a request body\n  to determine if the origin server is willing to accept the request\n  (based on the request headers) before the client sends the request\n  body. In some cases, it might either be inappropriate or highly\n  inefficient for the client to send the body if the server will reject\n  the message without looking at the body.\n\nIe. in the absence of an (or an incorrect) Authentication: header it \nwould be inappropriate and inefficient for the client to send a \nredundant request entity.\n\nThen later in the same section,\n\n  Requirements for HTTP/1.1 origin servers:\n\n      - Upon receiving a request which includes an Expect request-header\n        field with the &quot;100-continue&quot; expectation, an origin server MUST\n        either respond with 100 (Continue) status and continue to read\n        from the input stream, or respond with a final status code. The\n        origin server MUST NOT wait for the request body before sending\n        the 100 (Continue) response. If it responds with a final status\n        code, it MAY close the transport connection or it MAY continue\n        to read and discard the rest of the request.  It MUST NOT\n        perform the requested method if it returns a final status code.\n\nWhere &quot;final status code&quot; means _any_ response status other than 100 \nContinue.\n\n(As you spotted, the request header is Expect: 100-continue, not Allow: \nas I said originally).\n\nCheers,\n\n\nMiles\n\n"}}
