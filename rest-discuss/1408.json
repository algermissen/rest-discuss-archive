Mike Dierken wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;m confused - a cookie is part of the HTTP message, both request and\n&gt; response.\n\nYes, but the information necessary to understand what a message with\na cookie means, is not part of the message.\n\nGET /foo HTTP/1.1\n\nhas one meaning for all time, which you can lookup in RFC 2616.\n\nGET /foo HTTP/1.1\nCookie: bar=goo\n\ncan have many meanings depending upon what magic that cookie induces\nin the behaviour of the server.  You can&#39;t look up what it means\nanywhere.\n\n&gt; The problem I have is that they are often used to qualify the URI - for\n&gt; example\n&gt; http://my.example.org/startpage.asp is the same URI for everyone, but\n&gt; the\n&gt; page - the &#39;actual&#39; resource - is different based on the value of the\n&gt; cookie. This makes the sample URI unsharable, uncacheable, etc. - which\n&gt; is\n&gt; good or bad depending on what you are trying to do.\n&gt; They are also often used to identify the user, or at least a user&#39;s\n&gt; server-side session.\n\nRight, that&#39;s a special case of the problem I described above; if you\nallow a message&#39;s meaning to change (be it the identified-resource, the\nauthorization info, etc..) depending upon information not in the message\nitself, then you can very easily do the Wrong Thing.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
