It is\ninstead a suggestion=\r\n to have a well-known set of media types that can be\nused for interoperable=\r\n REST; the rest (no pun intended) would simply follow\nthe REST architecture=\r\n style as they have previously.\n\nBTW, having a set of well-known media type=\r\ns also means a set of well-known\nsemantics for how the service should opera=\r\nte.

There are two possible extremes for REST:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=95 One Media Type To Rule Them All (=E0 la SOAP) =95 Every \n&gt; service come=\r\ns up \n&gt; &gt; with its own media type\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Neither of these is healthy. The=\r\n latter, in particular, gains you \n&gt; &gt; little over RPC in terms of decoupli=\r\nng, although you get \n&gt; some of the \n&gt; &gt; other benefits of REST.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; W=\r\ne need a middle ground: a small variety of somewhat generic media \n&gt; &gt; type=\r\ns that can be used for a wide variety of things.\n&gt; &gt; Individual services ca=\r\nn then use one of them, and clients \n&gt; can then be \n&gt; &gt; implemented as glue=\r\n on top of a library.\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree with that complete.  \n&gt; \n&gt; We could call=\r\n this &quot;Webful API&quot; (to sidestep Roy&#39;s past \n&gt; concern about using the &quot;REST=\r\n&quot; name.)  Webful APIs could be \n&gt; defined by either new content types or a =\r\nsubset of existing \n&gt; content types, and each one would be defined by a str=\r\ning of \n&gt; information, vetted by working groups, and recorded at IANA.  \n&gt; =\r\nFor example, assume we defined a Webful API for interacting \n&gt; with Events =\r\nof the type that Eventful, UpComing, and Meetup \n&gt; allow you to schedule (b=\r\ntw, I need this.)  It&#39;s \n&gt; identification string could be:\n&gt; \n&gt; \t&quot;webful-ap=\r\ni/events&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Or \n&gt; \n&gt; \t&quot;application/webful-api+xml/events&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; That=\r\n=92s what I think is great about the AtomPP: it provides \n&gt; a base for \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n a large array of services by defining a few base media types and a \n&gt; &gt; nu=\r\nmber of HTTP transactions complete with meanings, \n&gt; granular enough to \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; be useful without customisation, but with clear extension hooks \n&gt; &gt; thro=\r\nughout.\n&gt; \n&gt; To me this is too close to &quot;the one Media Type to rule them \n&gt;=\r\n all&quot; (what would we do w/o Tolkien?!?).  AtomPP seems to me \n&gt; to be more =\r\nof a well-defined conduit for implementing \n&gt; services than anything that w=\r\nould help identify specific \n&gt; services, but I haven&#39;t been following it cl=\r\nosely enough to \n&gt; know for sure.\n&gt; \n&gt; So at the risk of having an opinion =\r\nbased on ignorance, I&#39;d \n&gt; say that AtomPP would be a great base but we sti=\r\nll need to be \n&gt; able to define Webful APIs for specific services, i.e.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \t&quot;application/atomserv+xml/events&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Event&quot;s here would still be vett=\r\ned by a working group \n&gt; somewhere and still need to be registered with IAN=\r\nA.\n&gt; \n&gt; How does that sit with you?\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; -Mike Schinkel\n&gt; http://www.m=\r\nikeschinkel.com/blogs/\n&gt; http://www.welldesignedurls.org\n&gt; http://atlanta-w=\r\neb.org - http://t.oolicio.us\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
