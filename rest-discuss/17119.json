WE&#39;ve certainly been talking about it quite a bit&lt;g&gt;.\n\n&lt;snip&gt; I still look for someone that explains in clear terms why is\nWSDL so bad. &lt;/snip&gt;\nPersonally, I don&#39;t find WSDL to be &quot;bad.&quot; I do, however, assert that\nthe WSDL pattern is not compatible w/ Fielding&#39;s particular arch\nmodel. WSDL, as I&#39;ve experienced it (and continue to experience it)\ndoes not employ hypermedia to drive the transfer of application state.\nThe WSDL implementations I see today still assume design-time\nconsumption and binding of a static, strongly-typed schema. I have yet\nto find WSDL implementations that induce the &quot;Architectural Properties\nof Key Interest&quot;[1] Fielding outlines; especially Modifiability. For\nthese reasons, when working in an arch model that follows the\nFielding&#39;s REST, I resist adding  WSDL|WADL implementations to the\narchitecture.\n\n&lt;snip&gt;At the end the answer is usually it supports RPC, which is not\nthe case lately.&lt;/snip&gt;\nI find this interesting. I still see WSDL delivered to me by\nthird-party integrators that is in the RPC style. In fact, I cannot\nrecall ever implementating a document-style WSDL integration for\nproduction use. I&#39;d very much like to see some examples of this. The\nclosest I&#39;ve been able to come to any &quot;document-style&quot; w/ WSDL I&#39;ve\nbeen given is to implement a single XML message-handler that treats a\nrange of calls eash as a unique &quot;message format&quot; instead of a single\ndocument model for a related set of request/response interactions.\nMaybe I am simply working w/ rather dull folks who are not keeping up\non WSDL evolution. Please feel free to pass along any pointers you\nhave on document-style WSDL implementations (here or off-list, if you\nlike).\n\n[1] \nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/net_app_arch.htm#sec_2_3\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\nhttp://twitter.com@mamund\nhttp://mamund.com/foaf.rdf#me\n\n\n#RESTFest 2010\nhttp://rest-fest.googlecode.com\n\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Dec 23, 2010 at 09:54, William Martinez Pomares\n&lt;wmartinez@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello.\n&gt; I still look for someone that explains in clear terms why is WSDL so bad. \n&gt; At the end the answer is usually it supports RPC, which is not the case \n&gt; lately. Actually, it never was, as document style services should be the \n&gt; ones to use. Oh, well.\n&gt;\n&gt; Why is WSDL needed? To describe the actual service consumption process. \n&gt; Where do we find the service? Where do we find the document format we need \n&gt; to send or expect to receive? Where do we find the message send a receive \n&gt; pattern? It is there, in the WSDL.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, REST allows that flow to be discovered, rather than written in one \n&gt; place. Ian&#39;s description of the use of XForms achieves that, so they are \n&gt; similar in the goal, may not be so similar in the process. Both will \n&gt; required some out-of-band information. XForms is not forcing the POST \n&gt; method, actually. Is is a way to describe the expected data in a known \n&gt; format, reducing coupling. You may later change the XFORM given some data \n&gt; for the request is changed, and nothing breaks (as a matter of fact, with \n&gt; WSDL should happen the same, but people use compile time binding, stubs, \n&gt; that break that possibility).\n&gt;\n&gt; That said, I think the benefit of this form is it avoid, at least a \n&gt; little, the early binding that WADL or WSDL have. So, you are creating \n&gt; totally dynamic clients instead of static ones, pre-build with stubs and \n&gt; things like that. There is still one problem to solve, though, the \n&gt; semantics of the data fields in the Form. But that should be managed as a \n&gt; pre defined context, with a general, agreed upon, glossary.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers.\n&gt;\n&gt; William Martinez Pomares.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, J�rn Wildt &lt;jw@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I was reading Ian Robinsons &quot;Using typed links to forms&quot; (again, it&#39;s a \n&gt;&gt; good\n&gt;&gt; read) at http://iansrobinson.com/2010/09/02/using-typed-links-to-forms/.\n&gt;&gt; Here he introduces the idea of adding XForms to a link relation, such \n&gt;&gt; that\n&gt;&gt; instead of having only:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;link rel=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; and document out of band how to post data to that link, one could have an\n&gt;&gt; XForm at the end of the link and then use that information as the\n&gt;&gt; online/inline/in-band documentation. I think that&#39;s quite a neat idea, \n&gt;&gt; but\n&gt;&gt; it strikes me that it&#39;s getting awfull close to a WSDL spec.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Both XForm and WSDL defines how to POST data adhering to a specific XML\n&gt;&gt; schema. If you then add a list of links to XForms, the list would be much\n&gt;&gt; like the WSDL list of methods/messages. The rel=&quot;&quot; types would specify \n&gt;&gt; WSDL\n&gt;&gt; message names.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In all we could have an HTML 5 list like the one below and call it the \n&gt;&gt; WSDL\n&gt;&gt; method list:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;dl&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Title&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;dd&gt;Description&lt;/dd&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;/dl&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Each of the achors then points to an XForm which in turn points to an XML\n&gt;&gt; schema definition and defines POST urls - just like WSDL does.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Is this good or bad? Is it better or worse than WSDL and WADL? Other\n&gt;&gt; opinions?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thanks, J�rn\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
