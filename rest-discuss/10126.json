So why would I want to \n&gt; use an XML database?\n&gt; \n&gt; Because the project would no longer be a nightmare?\n\nIt was the XSLT that cause it to be a nightmare, not how it was stored.  How\ncan adding another XML layer fix the nightmare that was XSLT?\n\n&gt; &gt; If *I* insist?  Why not learn something about the \n&gt; open-source project \n&gt; &gt; before assigning me the responsibility of having selected \n&gt; the backend.  \n&gt; &gt; (Even so, I would not these days ever choose an XML database...)\n&gt; \n&gt; Many, many projects have used SQL databases for this because \n&gt; there were no reasonable alternatives. That is changing. \n&gt; Needing database services does not imply that one needs to \n&gt; cut everything into fields or store unstructured BLOBs. These \n&gt; are the compromises we have made because we had no better \n&gt; alternatives.\n\nI used to believe that.  Now I&#39;m not so sure...\n\n&gt; Now, however, better alternatives are appearing by the month. \n&gt; Three or even two years ago, the right choice for a new web \n&gt; system was still a SQL database. However in many cases that&#39;s \n&gt; not true any more, and it&#39;s less and less true by the month \n&gt; as XML databases improve.\n\nSo pray tell what are some of these &quot;better alternatives&quot; that you speak of?\n\n&gt; The legacy systems like WordPress and Drupal will be with us \n&gt; for a long time of course. \n\nAgreed. But it isn&#39;t helpful to advocate someone using WordPress or Drupal\nto use an XML Database when what they need to learn if the best way to\nprovide a RESTful interface for the existing system.\n\nSome people have real work to do.\n\n&gt; When they were invented they made \n&gt; the right choices for backends. But were a similar product \n&gt; invented today, the right choice of backend would be very different.\n\nSuch as?\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Granted, JavaScript is deployed in more browsers than XML, but I \n&gt; &gt;&gt; wouldn&#39;t go so far as to call it a default.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d challenge that. Off the top of my head I can&#39;t think of a \n&gt; single current browser that supports JavaScript but not XML. \n&gt; I also know many people who turn off JavaScript (perhaps on a \n&gt; site-by-site basis using the Firefox NoScript extension). I \n&gt; don&#39;t know anybody who turns off XML. \n&gt;   I don&#39;t think you even can, and nobody&#39;s asked to be able \n&gt; to do that. \n&gt; The X in XSS does not stand for XML.\n\nAgain, you can argue for XML, or you can just get work done with JSON.\n\n&gt; None of that&#39;s relevant if you&#39;re using XSLT. There are \n&gt; exactly three annoying cross-browser problems you have to \n&gt; deal with in XSLT: white space handling, the document() \n&gt; function, and MIME types. All three are well understood and \n&gt; easily dealt with. \n\nAre you advocating writing a rich-client app in XSLT complete with all the\nfunctionality available in, say, Gmail?\n\n&gt; Would you even want to attempt to \n&gt; enumerate the cross-browser issues in JavaScript?\n\nNo need, I just use jQuery\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Developing and debugging AJAX applications cross-browser \n&gt; is 100 times \n&gt; &gt;&gt; more of a chore than XSLT apps.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I strongly disagree with that assertion.  I worked on a \n&gt; failed project \n&gt; &gt; I previously referenced that used XSLT, and as it grew it \n&gt; became more \n&gt; &gt; and more fragile to the point of being completely \n&gt; unworkable. The side \n&gt; &gt; effects that can results from an XSLT transform and their \n&gt; unintended \n&gt; &gt; consequents are legendary.\n&gt; \n&gt; I call bullshit on that. That is so far from my experience I \n&gt; simply don&#39;t believe you.\n\nAre you saying I didn&#39;t work on a failed XSLT transform project?  I can most\ncertainly guarantee I did.  Do you want me to send you the files to provde\nit?!?!?\n\nI was using XML for marking up documents and XLST for tranforming them for\npublishing for http://www.howtoselectguides.com which is now dormant because\nof our use of XML & XSLT. We painted ourself into a corner and couldn&#39;t dig\nour way out. We lost momentum and I just had to gave up on it.  One day I\nmight revisit, but it will be with SQL and PHP and not with XML & XSLT.\n\nThat said, maybe you are better than me and can somehow overcome the design\nlimitations of XSLT.  I&#39;m not that superhuman.\n\n&gt; Ah, now I understand. You never actually learned XSLT. You \n&gt; learned the Microsoft  pseudo-XSLT. I&#39;m afraid Microsoft did \n&gt; some very nasty things in the early days of IE 5 and XML. \n\nNo it wasn&#39;t IE5 days; it was 2005.  I learned XSLT 1.0, and I have about 6\nXSLT books on my bookshelf to prove it including Michael Kay&#39;s.  \n\nYou are certainly familiar with the &quot;Expression must evaluate to a node-set&quot;\nissue, no? Microsoft&#39;s msxsl:node-set() resolves it, but it isn&#39;t\nstandards-based XSLT as standards-based XSLT is brain-dead:\n\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blog/gettingpastthexslterrorexpressionmustevalua\ntetoanodeset/\n\n&gt; They have now mostly recanted those. \n&gt; Microsoft was the one marching out of step with the band, not \n&gt; everybody else. You are, I am afraid, yet another victim of \n&gt; Microsoft disinformation.\n\nHARDLY.  I wrote vanilla XSLT 1.0 and only used MS extensions where XSLT 1.0\nwas woefully inadequate.\n\n&gt; XSLT is a pure functional language with no side effects. \n\nPullease.  I&#39;d write XSLT for an XML document, and then another XML document\nthat validates to the same schema would trigger differences in the XSLT\ntransform; it would either break or produce output that I wasn&#39;t expecting.\nIt was a nightmare to debug those situations and they happened over and\nover.\n\n&gt; Whatever language you were working with it certainly doesn&#39;t \n&gt; sound like XSLT. It sounds like someone fed you a haggis for \n&gt; Christmas dinner, called it a turkey, and consequently you \n&gt; now think we&#39;re all crazy because we say we love turkey.\n\nYour annoying use of condescention given you really have no knowledge of my\nexperience only reflects negatively on you.\n\n&gt; &gt; But the irony of this argument is I don&#39;t really need to \n&gt; make it.  A \n&gt; &gt; large number of developers are using JSON/Javascript instead of \n&gt; &gt; XML/XSLT for the very reasons I mention; it is just a whole \n&gt; lot easier \n&gt; &gt; to use JSON than XML in the browser. That may frustrate \n&gt; those enamored \n&gt; &gt; with XML/XSLT, but developers are voting with their feet \n&gt; and all those \n&gt; &gt; advocating XML can&#39;t stop it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Actually no. I know not one single person (including you) who \n&gt; has chosen JavaScript/JSON over XML/XSLT. I do know many \n&gt; people who have chosen JavaScript/JSON over JavaScript/DOM \n&gt; but that&#39;s a very different story.\n\nIf you don&#39;t know them it&#39;s because you don&#39;t get out much.\nGoogle for JSON vs. XML and you&#39;ll find lots.\n\n&gt; &gt; Listen, the reason I&#39;m arguing strongly for JSON and against XML is \n&gt; &gt; because of the cargo-cultist mentality regarding XML that I seem to \n&gt; &gt; have unearthed here. I&#39;m not really anti-XML (though I am anti XSLT \n&gt; &gt; and anti- for overdoing namespaces, especially as namespaces \n&gt; &gt; identified by non-deferenceable URIs), I&#39;m just seeing that \n&gt; is many times easier to work with JSON in the browser.\n&gt; &gt; The fact you have to defend XML tells me though doth \n&gt; protest too much.\n&gt; \n&gt; You&#39;re not even ant-XSLT. You just think you are. I don&#39;t \n&gt; believe you&#39;ve ever worked with real XSLT. What you \n&gt; experienced was not XSLT.\n\nAnd I don&#39;t give a damn what you believe. The world doesn&#39;t revolve around\nwhat you believe Mr. ERH.\n\nBut for anyone else who cares just ask Mike Gunderloy who worked with me on\nthe project if I&#39;ve ever used XSLT; he was quite annoyed by my use of it,\namong other things\n\nAnd here are two more XSLT-related blog posts I wrote from 2004: \n\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blog/rantingaboutxsltsverbosity/\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blog/goodxslttutorial/\n\nAnd run this query: http://www.google.com/search?q=xslt+schinkel  You&#39;ll\nfind more than enough g*d d*mn evidence that YES I have used XSLT.  Thank\nyou very much.\n\nERH, next time do just 2 seconds of research before you accuse someone of\nnot having experience.\n\nAnd take your religion elsewhere; I&#39;m trying to get some work done.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org \n\n\n"}}
