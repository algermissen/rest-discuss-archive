I&#39;m not suggesting anybody changes vocabulary, just describing my\npoint of view.\n\nI find it important to know (as an application designer, not sure about the\nconsumer) whether the members of that resources are themselves (potentially)\nidentified via a URI. Those members also go away if a DELETE occurs on the\nfirst resource. I think. Maybe it varies by application.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; In any case, I don&#39;t see any reason why the DELETE method can \n&gt; not apply to a (set of) resource(s) identified by a URI with \n&gt; a query component.  \nWell, from outside the server, the URI doesn&#39;t identify a set of resources.\nIt identifies one. Those records in a db table aren&#39;t resources - at least,\nnot yet. I believe there are often multiple overlapping resources and we\njust have to design for it.\n\n"}}
