If we reexecute the sequence, the result of the second \n&gt; GET will \n&gt; &gt; have been affected by the first PUT ...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ... but hang on a minute: that&#39;s _only_ true with respect \n&gt; to client- \n&gt; &gt; visible results. If we&#39;re only paying attention to the \n&gt; effects of the \n&gt; &gt; sequence on the server, then this sequence is perfectly \n&gt; idempotent, and \n&gt; &gt; any number of reexecutions will have exactly the same effect as the \n&gt; &gt; first.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, an important difference between a sequence and an individual\n&gt; invocation that I don&#39;t think you&#39;re taking into account, is that\n&gt; application state is held by the client.  So between &quot;GET \n&gt; /foo&quot; and &quot;PUT\n&gt; /foo&quot;, the data being transferred may change.  For example, the client\n&gt; may be incrementing a counter.  Certainly, from both a client and\n&gt; server perspective, that&#39;s non-idempotent.\n&gt; \n&gt; MB\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Mark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\n&gt; Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\n&gt; http://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
