(BTW, of course www.xxx.yyy and ftp.xxx.yyy don&#39;t have any actual\nsemantic signficance.)  It&#39;s hard enough maintaining MX records in DNS, why in\nthe world do we want equivalents for other services?  Yuck.\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t think that DHCP has anything to do with\n&gt; DNS!\n\nNo, of course it doesn&#39;t.  I was trying to draw an architectural distinction,\nnot claim that they solve the same problem in different ways.  (If you squint\nwhile you read it, you&#39;ll see the point I was making rather badly. ;-)\n\n&gt; &gt; PS - I have in the past floated the idea (the &quot;metaweb&quot;) of using\n&gt; &gt; verifiable naming and HTTP&#39;s own 3xx response as a routing primitive in\n&gt; &gt; combination to make the Web self-naming and self-routing, independent of\n&gt; &gt; DNS and free from many of its current, unpleasant and unnecessary\n&gt; &gt; administrative constraints.  This is probably do-able with minimal\n&gt; &gt; impact on the existing Web architecture.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hmm.  Interesting.  Can you expand on that?\n\nProbably beyond the scope of this discussion, but this area has been a\nresearch focus of mine for about 18 months, now.  Still trying to sort out how\nmuch is public vs. how much is entangled with my current company, but at some\npoint I hope be able to freely discuss this in some detail.  (Focus as the\ncurrent play evolved has shifted / narrowed somewhat from our original effort\nin this area, so I&#39;m optimistic about being able to open it up.)\n\n&gt; Does\n&gt; it solve the problem of failover servers/load\n&gt; balancing?\n\nNot by itself, but it provides potential support for such solutions.\n\n&gt; &gt; There&#39;s a large amount of\n&gt; &gt; current work going on along these lines relative to distributed\n&gt; &gt; filesystems, filesharing, p2p and decentralized systems.  It would be\n&gt; &gt; nice to see a principled design for such functionality available for\n&gt; &gt; general use within the Web community.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes thats true, but it seems to focus on\n&gt; identifying documents not resources.  These are\n&gt; different.\n\nA key thing to understand is that there&#39;s a fundamental difference between\nsemantic names and identifiers.  Semantic name resolution maps a name to a\nset, potentially of order 1.  Identifier resolution maps an identifier which\nuniquely identifies a single object onto that object.  (Punt on the issue of\nwhether &quot;identified&quot; objects are required to be immutable.)  There&#39;re some\ninteresting mathematical games you can play with the distinction between these\nthings. ;-)  The big difference is that while moving, caching, replicating,\netc. static documents is trivial and can be safely assumed, the same cannot be\nsaid for resources in general.\n\n&gt; The most obvious replacement for names is google&#39;s\n&gt; &quot;I feel lucky&quot;, but I don&#39;t think it is really\n&gt; what you want in a protocol.\n\nWe&#39;re always going to need three kinds of names:  semantic names that map to\nsets of objects of arbitrary size, semantic names that map to a set of objects\nguaranteed to be of order 1, and names that map to a specific object i.e. are\n&quot;self-verifying.&quot;  For the first two kinds of naming, name resolution does\nindeed have to be a service.  The idea is to find ways to make this service as\ndecentralized, as dynamic, and as local in administrative scope as possible.\n\n$0.02,\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
