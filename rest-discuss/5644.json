Its semantics aren&#39;t necessarily grounded\n&gt; &gt; in universal concepts. On the other hand, text/html is grounded in the\n&gt; &gt; universal text concept. Other forms of html (no matter how they are\n&gt; &gt; categorised in any current perverted MIME) also contain universal\n&gt; &gt; semantics. They are part of REST for me.\n&gt; How will you express this request below in HTTP syntax:\n&gt; &quot;I prefer a ATOM formatted representation of the blog entry with its\n&gt; URL: /foo/bar&quot;.\n&gt; Now, what about this:\n&gt; &quot;I prefer a hAtom microformatted XHTML representation of the blog\n&gt; entry with its URL: /foo/bar&quot;.\n\nGET /foo/bar HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\nAccept: application/atom+xml\n\nand,\nGET /foo/bar HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\nAccept: text/html\n\nMicroformatted content has the advantage that it is real text/html, and\ncan be served as such. Whether it be hAtom, hCard, hCalendar, rel-tag,\nor any other microformat data, a parser can make use of whatever content\nit understands from the page. While hAtom borrows the atom semantic\nmodel its syntax is designed for integration with html, css, and\njavascript.\n\n&gt; When we are transferring representations, isn&#39;t it a good practice to\n&gt; specify exactly what media type we prefer to receive or what\n&gt; content-type we sent? If not mistaken, some had advised not to use\n&gt; &quot;application/xml&quot; media type while transferring a representation,\n&gt; since it does not describe semantics about the representation.\n\napplication/xml does not describe any specific semantics, so is a weak\nmedia type from the perspective of REST (at least as I define it).\nMicroformatted xhtml has concrete semantics.\n\n&gt; Without the help of Forms (e.g RDForm, HTML FORM etc) provided by\n&gt; servers, it seems to be important to state the &quot;specific&quot; accepted\n&gt; media-types, or else clients would have no clue what they required to\n&gt; send. For example, how will Server express that it accepts ATOM\n&gt; document but not any other XML document formats?\n\nExactly. As a client your accept header should not simply be\napplication/xml when you expect to handle atom. You won&#39;t understand any\nold xml document. It has to be atom, so you ask for application/atom\n+xml.\n\n&gt; In this case, when talking about &quot;universal semantics&quot;, do you mean a\n&gt; good media-type should be widely deployed, or recognized as standard\n&gt; among majority. Or do you mean media-type should be as general as\n&gt; possible even to sacrifice its capability of describing the semantics\n&gt; of a representation?\n\nThere is an element of adoption to the universal semantics question,\nhowever new semantics can still be universal if they can be applied\nuniversally. Date and time are universal concepts. The structure of a\nhtml document is a universal concept. A blog post is probably a\nuniversal concept. Each of these concepts is applicable to a variety of\napplications and industries.\n\nTo contrast, semantics that are not universal include &quot;the TRIP\noperation of a circuit breaker&quot; or it&#39;s &quot;DAC&quot; state. These semantics are\nspecific to the SCADA industry, and applications that exist within that\nindustry. Every industry has its own jargon and concepts that are\napplicable only within that defined problem domain. In my opinion those\nthings would usually not be able to be considered &quot;universal&quot;, although\nthere is somewhat of a sliding scale.\n\nI wrote recently about a semantic spectrum, with univerally-applicable\nconcepts such as &quot;GET me a html document&quot; on one end of the scale and\n&quot;call function foo with parameters bar and baz&quot; on the other. REST is\ngrounded in the universal, whereas object-orientation is grounded in the\napplication-specific. The space in-between could be coined &quot;the semantic\nweb&quot;.\n\n&gt; There is another overloading situation, where we just use a single\n&gt; &quot;application/xml&quot; media type in communications, when we actually mean\n&gt; ATOM, RSS or SOAP. The same thing which bothering me is overloading\n&gt; &quot;text/html&quot; or &quot;application/xhtml+xml&quot; when we actually means hAtom,\n&gt; hCard. The problem is Server could not inform Client that it accepts\n&gt; hAtom and not other XHTML document.\n\nThe difference between atom, rss, and soap as media types and\nmicroformatted html is that the html document is more of a container of\ndocuments than a single document. If you are able to deal with atom,\nrss, and soap you should identify each of those media types on your\nAccept header. If you are able to deal with a html document and find\nmicroformatted data within it you should identify text/html (or its\nvarious mime forms) also. You&#39;ll decide based on what is actually passed\nback which parser to invoke.\n\nThere have also been some suggestions thrown around that some popular\nmicroformats could make their way into the html standard as their own\nelements (eg a &lt;vcard&gt; element). Parsers would again simply look for\ndata they can make use of if that were to eventuate.\n\n&gt; This overloading confusion starts bothering when I attempt to use HTTP\n&gt; as publishing protocol for microformats. How to post a hAtom when\n&gt; Server can&#39;t even express that it accepts hAtom? I am certainly\n&gt; walking on the wrong path. ;-)\n\nI think the concern you are raising is in the case of a feed reader that\naccepts both atom and hAtom content. If it includes text/html in its\naccept header could the server provide html content that does not\ncontain hAtom markup and thus provide less information when presenting\nthe html version?\n\nThe answer is theoretically, yes. Would it occur in practice? I don&#39;t\nknow. Most publishers provide their atom and their html feeds on\ndifferent uris. Most feed readers will accept being pointed at the html\nuri first and if no useful data is found redirect themselves to a\npreferred alternative. Do you know of any existing websites where this\ncould be a problem? Are there any uris in the wild today that return\nhtml or atom/rss/other based on accept header data?\n\n-- \nBenjamin Carlyle &lt;benjamincarlyle@...&gt;\n\n\n"}}
