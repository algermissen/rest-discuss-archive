I&#39;m thinking about a primitive operation that\n&gt; &gt; supports readers.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; One writer alone could drive hundreds of readers. Just to pick an\n&gt; &gt; example: one writer pushes positive integers and many readers\n&gt; &gt; check for prime numbers. Not a very useful example on it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; own, but that single writer could drive many, many readers.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This thread (and the reliable messaging proposals for REST)\n&gt; &gt; have addressed many issues (like network failures. Perhaps\n&gt; &gt; ordered messaging isn&#39;t covered already.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know if a single generalized primitive operation is\n&gt; &gt; good enough to address this issue. This seems like a more\n&gt; &gt; variable problem than &quot;many writers&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; One of the things I&#39;ve been thinging about is how to\n&gt; &gt; re-implement the EIP patterns in RESTful systems, like\n&gt; &gt; Competing Consumers\n&gt; &gt; http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/CompetingConsumers.html\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This seems like a tough problem without another method. I\n&gt; &gt; haven&#39;t found a really good example of what to base that on\n&gt; &gt; though. Reading the GFS paper I realized that the append\n&gt; &gt; operation on GFS files supports many writers, but GFS doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; have an operation for many readers.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; John Heintz\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On 6/13/07, Mike Dierken &lt;dierken@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Outside of MOM I don&#39;t know of any generalized support\n&gt; &gt; for many readers.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You mean, many readers (of a single resource/message) but only one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; consumer/processor of that one resource?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; John D.
