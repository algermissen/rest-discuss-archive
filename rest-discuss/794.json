Of course it is the\nsame content-type. But in WRDL representations are more than content\ntypes. They also extract links (called &quot;references&quot;) in the manner\n&quot;expected&quot; by the resource type. If your news and weblog resources have\nall of the same logical links to all of the same other types then they\nare probably actually the same resource type (or have some subtyping\nrelationship which WRDL does not handle right now).\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
