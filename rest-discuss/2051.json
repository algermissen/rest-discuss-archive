Costello wrote:\n&gt; Hi Folks,\n&gt; \n&gt; The following question actually has a lot to do with REST, although it\n&gt; may not seem so.  Once I get my tutorial completed I will show how it\n&gt; all fits in with REST.  But for now, here&#39;s the question:\n&gt; \n&gt; I would like to create a REST resource which serves up XML and receives\n&gt; XML.  For those clients at a browser the XML will be styled into HTML\n&gt; via an XSLT stylesheet.  Suppose that this styling results in an HTML\n&gt; form that the user fills in to create a Purchase Order.  After the user\n&gt; fills in the form he presses &quot;Submit&quot;.  I would like for the Submit\n&gt; action to result in kicking off some script which harvests the data in\n&gt; the HTML form, create an XML string from the form data, and then HTTP\n&gt; PUTs the XML string back to the resource.  That&#39;s where I am stuck.  I\n&gt; know how to write some Javascript to harvest the form data and create an\n&gt; XML string, but I don&#39;t know how to then HTTP PUT the XML string to the\n&gt; resource (i.e., server).  Any ideas?  /Roger\n\nI thought XForms might have something to say on this -- but after a \nrather quick look at the spec I can&#39;t see anything.\n\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/xforms/\n\n\t[[\n\tXForms is an XML application that represents the next generation\n\tof Forms for the Web. By splitting traditional XHTML forms into\n\tthree parts - data model, instance data, and user interface -\n\tit separates presentation from content, allows reuse, gives\n\tstrong typing - reducing the number of round-trips to the\n\tserver, as well as offering device independence and\n\ta reduced need for scripting.\n\t\n\tXForms is not a free-standing document type, but is intended to\n\tbe integrated into other markup languages, such as XHTML.\n\t]]\n\nGuess this doesn&#39;t answer your question Roger, but I&#39;d be interested to \nhear if anyone here has looked into using XForms, and how it fits with \nthe REST perspective.\n\ncheers,\n\nDan\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.0.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\n\niD8DBQE9Tn+uPhXvL3Mij+QRAs9wAJ0bY/0AaOER2bj+USwfDRnGWtrYrwCgqzi5\nvEzGGuLWf+FltyIYwqPxh5k=\n=y3d3\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n\n"}}
