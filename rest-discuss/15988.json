Still, let&#39;s re=\r\nview what&#39;s in a URI.\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. A resource is not a URI. The URI is the identi=\r\nfier-name that actually identifies a resource. A resource can be anything, =\r\nand can have many names.\n&gt; 2. A client may not know all the names of a reso=\r\nurce. Actually, a resource may already exist with a different name the clie=\r\nnt ignores.\n&gt; 3. The client may have control over the URIs it uses, but it =\r\nshould never had control over the Server URIs.\n&gt; 4. I don&#39;t see why a resou=\r\nrce cannot have a name not given by the server, but I do see that a server =\r\nshould not be forced to name a resource.\n&gt; 5. The client should not infer n=\r\nothing from a URI. No folders, no types, nothing. That is why I prevent fro=\r\nm using templates. Too tempting.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, what all that means? It means you =\r\ncan use PUT with any name you want. That is your name, the URI from the cli=\r\nent. But the server owns its namespace, thus the resource may be created wi=\r\nth the name the server likes. Still, the server can note that you, as a cli=\r\nent, gave a special, particular name to that new resource. So, whenever you=\r\nr client requests that URI, the server knows which resource it refers to. I=\r\nf someone else, even your client, requests that resource using a search or =\r\nsomething, the URI that will be returned is that one of the server.\n&gt;\n\nI do=\r\nnt quite agree.=A0There is cost for doing this.=A0=A0See\nhttp://www.w3.org/=\r\nTR/webarch/#uri-aliases\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; See? The resource in this case has two URIs.=\r\n PUT has not forced the name into the server. The server keeps its autonomy=\r\n. The URI can be a cool URI client side, and use templates client side, and=\r\n have a structure client side. But server doesn&#39;t care. It just polite enou=\r\ngh to remember your name for that resource.\n&gt;\n\n&quot;Cool URIs don&#39;t change&quot; fro=\r\nm server side to client side.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Furthermore. As I said, the URI is not t=\r\nhe resource. You can PUT a resource with a name, but if the resource alread=\r\ny exists (the resource, NOT the name), it will fail. See? The server can ch=\r\neck the body of the PUT and if creating a resource from that duplicates an =\r\nalready existing resource, and that is not permitted, it will fail even if =\r\nthe resource you PUT has a completely new name. This is very important. We =\r\nare putting too much importance into URIs, when they are simply names to re=\r\nfer to the really important guy, the resource.\n&gt;\n\nChecking if a resource al=\r\nready exists by the representation from\nclient is costly and not reliable.\n=\r\n\nWhat happens if the URL the client wants already exists on the server?\nSho=\r\nuld it be interpreted as an update?\n\n&gt; Cheers.\n&gt;\n&gt; William Martinez Pomares=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Bryan Taylor &lt;bryan_w_taylor@...&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been discussing PUT for create with some coworkers. Th=\r\nis is certainly valid\n&gt; &gt; HTTP, but I&#39;m wondering if people consider it RES=\r\nTful. It seems to me that\n&gt; &gt; giving the client control over part of the UR=\r\nI requires them to understand how\n&gt; &gt; resources are organized and forces th=\r\nem to construct URIs as non-opaque strings.\n&gt; &gt; So I wonder if this conflic=\r\nts with HATEOAS. It potentially also puts a burden on\n&gt; &gt; the client to avo=\r\nid namespace collisions, so that it must adopt some uniqueness\n&gt; &gt; logic wh=\r\nich again requires application state that seems problematic.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
