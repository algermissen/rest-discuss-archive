URL Construction using Key-Value Pairs plus Conjunction\n&gt; http://www.location.org?country=US&state=MA&city=Boston\n&gt; (1) The above URLs (I believe) are expressing the same thing - they\n&gt; are identifying the same resource.  So which is &quot;better&quot;?\n\nSome people like query parts in their URIs. Others don&#39;t. My personal\nfeelings go towards &quot;whatever works&quot;. I lean towards &quot;query parts make\nfor ugly URIs when they aren&#39;t required for an explicit reason&quot;, but\nthat is pure asthetics talking.\n\nThe publisher of data should be able to define whatever URI scheme they\nlike. Internally, they can construct URIs in any way they see fit. So\nlong as they present these constructed URIs as hyperlinks to subscribers\nof their data the URI scheme can evolve separately to client concerns.\nClients can traverse a hyperlink to http://www.example.com/US/MA/Boston\nand http://www.example.com/?country=US&state=MA&city=Boston just as\neasily. There is no best practice. There should be no best practice. The\nbest practice is to allow that publisher&#39;s URI space to evolve\nindependently of any software implementation by a subscriber.\n\nThe problem comes into things when you start requring clients to\nconstruct URIs. Sometimes this may be necessary, and the best technology\nwe have to achieve URI construction on the client side is the use of\nHTML forms. This technology uses a form provided by the publisher to\nconstruct a URI from a base part and a query part (as well as providing\nseveral other submission techniques, including non-query forms). In this\ncase obviously having URIs exposed that have a query part may be of some\nbenefit. It is usually this technology, and the extent to which your\nsite design demands the use of this technology that determines the\nextent to which you use query parts.\n\n&gt; (2) As was noted at the top, the purpose of a URL is to &quot;identify&quot; a\n&gt; resource.  Can every resource in the universe be identified using the\n&gt; above two approaches?  Are there resources that do not lend themselves\n&gt; to identification using the above two approaches?\n\nEvery resource in the universe could be identified using either\ntechnique. The question of what lends itself to what is one of asthetics\nonly.\n\n-- \nBenjamin Carlyle &lt;benjamincarlyle@...&gt;\n\n\n"}}
