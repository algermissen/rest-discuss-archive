Eg: \n\nhttp://example.com/my-tasks \n  vs \nhttp://e=\r\nxample.com/tasks?user=3Djoe\n\nWe&#39;ve consider offering both and having my-tas=\r\nks redirect to the appropriate user=3D resource. This helps caching, but at=\r\n the cost of an extra network round trip. It also creates a potential for a=\r\n direct object reference vulnerability, as I can&#39;t trust URIs that come fro=\r\nm joe to always say user=3Djoe as joe my get frisky and hand edit it to be =\r\nuser=3Djane. So I have to check the auth&#39;d user vs the URI parameter anyway=\r\n. Though I might actually want managers to be able to use the user=3D form =\r\non employees that report up to them. \n\nThe my-tasks URI has a huge advantag=\r\ne that it&#39;s static, so I can give it to users from static content, or more =\r\nimportantly from external or non-authenticated content where the server tha=\r\nt delivers the URI doesn&#39;t know I call him joe. The redirect strategy also =\r\nworks for this.\n\nAside from breaking caching, is there anything wrong with =\r\njust returning joe&#39;s task when he hits my-tasks ? This contemplates a resou=\r\nrce that responds to GET with representations that depend on the session to=\r\nken from a cookie or a header. My thoughts on the redirect are that it&#39;s ST=\r\nILL a user dependent resource, and that unless I make the user type &quot;joe&quot; i=\r\nn a form, whatever page gives him the user=3Djoe link is probably also user=\r\n dependent. I suppose I could even save caching by using a rewrite rule ins=\r\ntead of a redirect.\n\n\n\n"}}
