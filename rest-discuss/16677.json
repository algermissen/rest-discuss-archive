I also can&#39;t square the\nreference to RFC 2048 with this statement:\n\n&quot;The problem is that I can&#39;t say &#39;REST requires media types to be\nregistered&#39; because both Internet media types and the registry\ncontrolled by IANA are a specific architecture&#39;s instance of the style\n-- they could just as well be replaced by some other mechanism for\nmetadata description.&quot;\n\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/6613\n\nI understand that some other protocol may instantiate a different form\nof registry, but how does replacing Internet media types not go against\nthe definition of data format in 5.2.1.2?  Should I be reading 5.2.1.2\nas &quot;most commonly known as a media type,&quot; i.e. as an example and not as\na definition?  In which case, should &#39;media type&#39; be read as &#39;data type&#39;\nelsewhere in 5.2.1.2?\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
