A &quot;stateless&quot; server is one which does not retain\n    conversational state on behalf of clients.\n\n2. A &quot;stateless&quot; connector is one which does not pass\n    keys to stored conversation state (c-state) to servers.\n\nThen, you have four possible couplings to examine:\n\n1. Stateless Server Stateful Connector\n\nThe server *may* be able to provide a syntactically\ncompliant implementation, but it would not really be\nparticipating in the protocol.  So, we&#39;re still in &quot;stateless&quot;\nterritory.\n\n2. Stateless Server Stateless Connector\n\nRESTFUL.\n\n3. Stateful Server Stateful Connector\n\nLess RESTFUL. :-)\n\n4. Stateful Server Stateless Connector\n\nNo way to coordinate c-state means the server can&#39;t\ndo it&#39;s stateful thing.  So we&#39;re &quot;stateless&quot; again.\n\nFrom the above it seems to me that either a stateless\ncomponent or a stateless protocol imposes statelessness\nin a heterogeneous coupling.\n\nBut, it seems obvious that &quot;stateless connector&quot; must\nbe a second order phenomenon, if it can really be defined\nat all (I&#39;d have trouble defining it well).  Meanwhile,\n&quot;stateless component&quot; is straightforward, since statefulness\nis part of the definition of &quot;component&quot; (typically), and\nthe modification is just &quot;no *conversation* state&quot;.\n\nWalden\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Mark Baker&quot; &lt;distobj@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;Walden Mathews&quot; &lt;waldenm@...&gt;\nCc: &quot;justin_t_sampson&quot; &lt;justin.sampson@...&gt;;\n&lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, February 13, 2004 4:30 PM\nSubject: State, again\n\n\n: Very nice, though I&#39;d add that I&#39;ve recently been referring to REST&#39;s\n: stateless constraint as a constraint on connectors, in constrast to\n: stateless components or stateless data elements (an oxymoron, as you\n: pointed out re &quot;stateless message&quot;).
