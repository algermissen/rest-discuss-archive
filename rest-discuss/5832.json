The naive RPC method would seem to be to  \ncreate a special URL string for each type, e.g.:\n\n\t/convert.cgi?format=pdf&document=mydocument.html\n\t/convert.cgi?format=doc&document=mydocument.html\netc.\n\nHowever, that doesn&#39;t seem very RESTful.  I would imagine the RESTful  \nalternative would be to:\na) PUT the initial resource; get a URL back\nb) &lt;do something to that URL&gt;\nc) Return the URL describing that resource\nd) GET the final resource\n\nBut, if so, I can&#39;t figure out the RESTful way to do (b). Is there?  \nWhat am I missing?  Or have I completely misconstrued the problem?\n\n-- Ernie P.\n\n  \n\n"}}
