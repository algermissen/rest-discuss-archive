(I \ndon&#39;t see any mention of this in Fielding&#39;s thesis, though.)\n\nThey work as follows:\n\n    * GET retrieves a representation of a resource\n    * POST adds to a resource\n    * PUT replaces a resource\n    * DELETE removes a resource\n\nIf your resources are single items, or lists, this seems to work pretty \nwell.  Maybe even if they are hash tables.  But I&#39;m not clear, if they \nare more complex data structures, how well these verbs would map.  \nThere&#39;s no obvious way to do a search, for example.  If a book is at \n/books/2893, I can delete that book, or replace it, but how do I search \nfor a book with &quot;REST&quot; in the title?  Maybe GET \n/book-search?title-contains=REST, but then, what&#39;s the resource?  The \nbook search?  What happens if I do PUT /book-search &quot;blah blah blah&quot;?  \nDoes it change the code?\n\nIs it possible to apply REST to any other actions, besides data \nmanipulation?  Suppose my HTTP server is a robot, and I want to tell it \nto ring the doorbell.  What verb would apply?  What&#39;s the resource - the \nrobot?  It&#39;s arm?  Or the doorbell?  Suppose I want to tell it to wait \nuntil the toast pops up, then put it on a plate.  What&#39;s the verb for \nthat?  All these sorts of things are easy to cover with RPC, or OO-type \npredicates, where you can make up verbs at will.  Is REST just not \nsuited to these sorts of situations?\n\n-- \nLyle Kopnicky\nSoftware Project Engineer\nVeicon Technology, Inc.\n\n\n"}}
