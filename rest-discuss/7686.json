I quote from this reference below:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; One problem is that the behavior of returning ETag in response to a PUT request isn&#39;t specified by HTTP\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; However a reading of 10.2.2 indicates otherwise. Since the reference I am quoting is rather recent, I am wondering what is missing? I would imagine that the ETag would be used with PUT in order to provide a desired level of concurrency control.\n&gt;\n&gt; I understand this is not an RFC 2616 discussion group, but this question is aimed at understanding how response headers are restricted by the operations requested of a resource.\n\nI know it is rather chatty, but this is the way that interpret the\nHTTP spec to obtain an ETag:\n\n--&gt;\nPUT /foo\n\n{entity}\n\n&lt;--\n201 Created\nDate: Mon, 22 Jan 2007 22:26:08 GMT\n\n--&gt;\nHEAD /foo\nIf-Unmodified-Since: Mon, 22 Jan 2007 22:26:08 GMT\n\n&lt;--\n200 OK\nETag: &quot;abc123&quot;\n\nHope that helps, Alan Dean\n\n"}}
