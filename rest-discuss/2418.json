We touched on this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; before. What is the &#39;function&#39; of an HTTP PUT?  I.e., which\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mapping are we interested in?  Clearly, sometimes it&#39;s resource\n&gt; &gt; &gt; before-and-after state.  At other times it may be more like\n&gt; &gt; &gt; request-to-response mapping?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yes, I think that&#39;s right.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t understand the distinction I guess.\n\nOK, I think this example illustrates the difference,\n\n  DELETE /foo   =&gt;  200 OK\n  DELETE /foo   =&gt;  404 Not Found\n\nOn the resource/server state view the only things which count towards \nidempotence are changes of state at the server (I take this to be the \nREST view). Because the effect on the server of deleting /foo two or \nmore times is the same as the effect on the server of deleting it just \nonce we can count DELETE as idempotent.\n\nOn the client-visible-effects view the result is relevant (maybe as well \nas server state, maybe instead of). Because the client visible results \nof the second and subsequent deletions of /foo are different from that \nof the first we can&#39;t count DELETE as idempotent.\n\nGiven that RFC 2616 stipulates that DELETE is idempotent it seems as \ntho&#39; the client-visible-effects view must be wrong. But that can&#39;t be \nthe whole story because of RFC 2616&#39;s allusions to non-idempotent \nsequences of idempotent requests. If my proof that on the resource/ \nserver view all sequences of idempotent requests are idempotent \nsequences is correct, then either there&#39;s something wrong with RFC 2616 \n(maybe the discussion of non-idempotent sequences should be dropped, or \nmaybe there&#39;s an inconsistency somewhere), or there&#39;s something wrong \nwith the resource/server state view and hence a disconnect between REST \nand RFC 2616.\n\n&gt; We haven&#39;t had any troubles.  We tried to use Jeff Mogul&#39;s\n&gt; out-of-order spec, but had practical issues with it (it requires using\n&gt; a new client stack).  But we don&#39;t have a lot of heard reliability\n&gt; guarantees in our use of our platform, so it&#39;s possible that I&#39;m\n&gt; missing an edge case that demonstrates the disconnect.\n\nDoes your client stack implement request piplining? If it does, there&#39;s \npresumably somewhere where a decision has to be made about whether to \npipeline a request immediately or wait for pending responses to arrive. \nI played cautious and only allowed piplining for GET and then only if \nthe only pending responses were for GETs.\n\nCheers,\n\n\nMiles\n\n"}}
