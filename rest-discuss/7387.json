My operation has succeeded. Whatever else the\n&gt; &gt; server chooses to do with my submission is up to it. I don&#39;t see any\n&gt; &gt; need to redirect a client to a specific new document version in  \n&gt; order to\n&gt; &gt; allow their PUT operation to proceed.\n&gt;\n&gt; It does seem to be a bit of a bone of contention. If we assume that\n&gt; /mydocument *does* change, i.e. that it is equivalent to\n&gt; /mydocument;current or maybe /mydocument?revision=current , and always\n&gt; reflects the state of the last change, then the PUT to /mydocument is\n&gt; only idempotent with respect to /mydocument and not to the entire\n&gt; namespace. This is a problem since RFC 2616 defines an idempotent  \n&gt; method\n&gt; in terms of its side-effects not its direct effects, if you see what I\n&gt; mean.\n\n*sigh*\n\nJust ignore the definition of idempotent in RFC 2616.  Anything\nspecified in HTTP that defines how the server shall implement the\nsemantics of an interface method is wrong, by definition.  What\nmatters is the effect on the interface as expected by the client,\nnot what actually happens on the server to implement that effect.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
