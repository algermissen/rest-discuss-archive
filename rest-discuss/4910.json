If everybody is touting REST as &quot;the One(tm) who\n&gt; made Web successful&quot;, it just seems natural that it is &quot;the founding\n&gt; technology&quot;. That means it should&#39;ve been supported by anything BEFORE\n&gt; now.\n[deletia]\n&gt; is going to complain. Maybe that can happen several years from now where\n&gt; you won&#39;t be able to log in to your Gmail if your browser doesn&#39;t support\n&gt; REST. :-P\n\nConsider that I don&#39;t need to download Google Mail client 1.0.5 in order\nto access my gmail account ... that&#39;s REST in action.\n\nConsider that I can post blog entries to whatever program I like ... or\nmaybe even one that I don&#39;t install, but instead is provided as a Web\nservice (e.g., blogger, TypePad, &c.) ... without having to use special\nsoftware.\n\nConsider I can buy an airline ticket, across many different companies\nwith competing interests, using the same piece of software.\n\nConsider that we can seamlessly interlink between the all the\n(nearly-infinite number of) wikis, without a (novel) RPC in sight.\n\nConsider I don&#39;t need to wait for a bug fix in Bloglines.linux\nv.2.71-R-42, since it&#39;s strangely incompatible with Gnome 2.4, since I\nhaven&#39;t upgraded, yet, since that&#39;s incompatible yadda yadda...\n\nConsider I can control my wireless router/firewall/gateway box without\nhaving to install any new software.\n\nConsider the parallels with treating every digital-music players as a\n&quot;mass storage device&quot; with a constrained interface, rather than as a\nnovel-thing-with-a-unique-API-that-I-need-special-software-to-talk-to.\n\nYou have this belief that REST is something it is not.   REST is an\narchitectural style ... a description of the architectural constraints\nthat enabled the web to be successful.  It is supported everywhere you\nlook, but perhaps you are not looking for the right things, or in the\nright way.  It will not &quot;one day rise&quot;, since it is already here.\n\nIf you continue to believe REST to be solely HTTP&#39;s GET/PUT/POST/DELETE,\nthen you&#39;re probably not going to see it because -- yes -- that doesn&#39;t\nexist in the same way.  But that alone is not REST.\n\nIt may be that REST is not appropriate when a human is not in the loop,\njust past the end of the User Agent, to interpret the very generic HTML\nand Forms that are coming back... it may be that when we want our\nweb-store front-end to talk to Amazon Web Services, we really _do_ want\nto do RPC and tightly couple those semantics directly into the\nsoftware.  I don&#39;t think I agree, but regardless, there is immense value\nin trying to see how closely we can make those machine/machine\ninteractions (traditionally done with RPC) emulate the human/machine\ninteractions of the Web.  It is interesting to understand the tradeoffs\ninvolved in, for instance, actually using hypermedia as the engine of\napplication state ... identifying resources rather than operations ...\nconstraining our methods/interface very specifically.  We would like\nfuture distributed systems to be as flexible and scaleable as the Web is\n-- or understand why they won&#39;t/can&#39;t be such -- and thus, we discuss\nREST.\n\n...jsled\n\n-- \nhttp://asynchronous.org/ - `a=jsled; b=asynchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b}`\n\n"}}
