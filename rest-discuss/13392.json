One is to have the cancel state as part of the\n&gt;&gt; order. THen I can just put a new representation with the cancelled\n&gt;&gt; state set to true:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; PUT /orders/333\n&gt;&gt; content-type: application/xml\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;order id=&quot;333&quot;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     &lt;cancelled&gt;false&lt;/cancelled&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ...\n&gt;&gt; &lt;/order&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Seems kinda heavy to me.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Would it still be restful to define a &quot;cancelled&quot; URI that you could\n&gt;&gt; put or post to to change the state?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Absolutely not.  When you want to change the state of a resource, you\n&gt; manipulate that resource -- you don&#39;t assign the operation to some\n&gt; other URL.  The proper way of doing this is what you started with, as\n&gt; myself and others told you.  But you are more concerned with calling\n&gt; what you&#39;re doing REST by playing semantics with the terminology, than\n&gt; you are with learning REST -- this is my opinion from dealing with you\n&gt; on rest-discuss, and observing your responses to others on rest-discuss.\n&gt; \n\nIf you want, I can send you hundreds of other emails I&#39;ve sent that you \ncan use to discredit me.  One particularly juicy one I sent a few years \nago is where I described REST as &quot;pretty&quot; URLs.  Ping me offline if \nyou&#39;re interested.\n\nSeriously though, considering the plethora of different responses to \nthis thread, a lot of people are performing similar thought exercises.\n\n&gt;&gt; /orders/333/cancelled\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; or\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; /orders/333?cancel=true\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You don&#39;t even need to send data to change the state in this\n&gt;&gt; scenario. But the problem with this from a pure RESTful standpoint\n&gt;&gt; is, isn&#39;t this a mini-RPC?  My thought at first is YES IT IS....\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, it is RPC, and your first clue should be, &quot;you don&#39;t even need to\n&gt; send data to change the state...&quot;  In REST, state is changed by\n&gt; manipulating representations of resources.  Sending a POST to some\n&gt; action-URL with no content in it, is the epitome of a non-RESTful\n&gt; interaction.\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; .... But, consider if you have cancelling as part of a HATEOAS\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;order id=&quot;333&quot;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     &lt;atom:link rel=&quot;CANCEL&quot;\n&gt;&gt; href=&quot;http://example.com/orders/333/cancelled&quot;/&gt; ...\n&gt;&gt; &lt;/order&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Now, I have a CANCEL link that if I follow changes the state of my \n&gt;&gt; resource.  Doesn&#39;t seem so RPCish now that I&#39;ve embedded it as a\n&gt;&gt; link. Maybe the answer is /orders/333/cancelled isn&#39;t very RESTful by\n&gt;&gt; itself, but when combined with HATEOAS it is?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; No, providing a link to a resource doesn&#39;t make that resource RESTful.\n&gt; Pretend I&#39;ve just posted a link to a butt-ugly URL that obviously has\n&gt; nothing to do with REST.  Following the link to get to that butt-ugly\n&gt; non-RESTful URL doesn&#39;t make that URL RESTful.\n&gt;  \n\nWell consider a different scenario that I had posted earlier.  You are \nmodeling a data cache.  Adding and retrieving data and representations \nfrom the cache is pretty easy to model restfully.  But consider the act \nof purging a cache or running some kind of eviction policy.  While \npurging a cache changes the state of the cache, it is in and of itself \n*not* state of the cache.  Pure operations do exist within applications.\n\nFuthermore, if links can&#39;t be mechanisms to modify the state of a \nresource, you&#39;ve pretty much discounted half of the Web itself.  I \nguarantee you 90% of Web applications out there that are accepting any \nkind of input are receiving that input via a Form and through an action URL.\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
