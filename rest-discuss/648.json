You can use it as it was designed to be\nused without tricking it. Any of us could implement an HTTP-based\nnotification scheme in a couple of hours. *BUT* the reason that what we\nare doing is difficult is because we are trying to define an HTTP\nnotification scheme *for* HTTP. i.e. we want to get our heads inside\nHTTP and design a notification model as it would have been designed by\nRoy, Henrik, Tim, Philip etc. at the time HTTP was being designed. This\nis much harder than figuring out a way to use HTTP for a particular\napplication.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; Note, if HTTP intermediaries decide to group\n&gt; chunks in awkward ways, that is not a problem with\n&gt; HTTP.  It is a problem with the intermediaries\n&gt; implementation.\n\nInfosar as the HTTP implementation says to treat the chunks as *one\nlogical stream* it is perfectly legit for an intermediary to re-chunk\nhowever it wants. It also might blow away the connection when it feels\nlike it has timed out. \n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
