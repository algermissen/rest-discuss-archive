It\n&gt;\n&gt; Yep.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; may not be one that would ever be returned via GET, but it is still\n&gt; &gt; one. Consider that if the proxy/origin- server link died right after\n&gt; &gt; the PUT succeeded, then the PUT request representation could be used\n&gt; &gt; as an estimate of the state of the targetted resource. That doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; seem unreasonable to me.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you do so, what ETag and Last-Modified headers do you serve it with?\n&gt; How long do you keep that entry?\n\nLast-Modified would be the time the 2xx response was received.  ETag\nwouldn&#39;t be set for the scenario I had in mind (non-surrogate proxy).\n\n&gt;\n&gt; It seems to me that this is an attempt to optimize a write operation at\n&gt; the risk of negatively affecting reads.\n\nCould be.\n\n&gt; &gt; Anyhow, this is mostly just conjecture on my part based on my\n&gt; &gt; understanding of the model. I&#39;d want to run through some use cases\n&gt; &gt; before I deployed software which made these assumptions.\n&gt;\n&gt; How would you make sure that your tests include the &quot;right&quot; set of\n&gt; combinations of clients, intermediaries and servers?\n\n*shrug*\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
