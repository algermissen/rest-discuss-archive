For usability reasons, I think an article\n&gt;&gt; translated into different languages should each have a different URI\n&gt;&gt; for each language. Likewise for usability I think the PDF form of an\n&gt;&gt; article should have a different URI from the HTML form. I do think\n&gt;&gt; content negotiation would be OK for things like deciding between GIF\n&gt;&gt; and PNF for an image, i.e., for forms of content that are\n&gt;&gt; &quot;commodities&quot; or very substitutable.\n&gt;\n&gt; I know what you mean especially from an usability perspective given\n&gt; the current state of affairs [3] but there is a cost involved in doing\n&gt; this as you might end up fragmenting your resource space. Say one of\n&gt; the articles on your website was about an &quot;Interview with Mr. Foo Bar&quot;\n&gt; and you had two versions of it, one in English\n&gt; (http://artima.com/articles/en/interview-with-foo-bar.html) and\n&gt; another in French\n&gt; (http://artima.com/articles/fr/interview-with-foo-bar.html). Now\n&gt; suppose this article is viewed a lot by your English speaking audience\n&gt; and they happen to point to it from various places on the web, you end\n&gt; up undervaluing the French version which is actually the same\n&gt; resource. Apart from this, request-headers give us a standard way to\n&gt; parametrize the request and get to the different representations\n&gt; whereas buy putting this information in the URI in a non-standard way\n&gt; makes its harder to get to the other representations.\n&gt;\n&gt; Example:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://artima.com/articles/interview-with-foo-bar\n&gt; Accept: text/html\n&gt;\n&gt; By changing the Accept header to application/pdf like so\n&gt;\n&gt; http://artima.com/articles/interview-with-foo-bar\n&gt; Accept: application/pdf\n&gt;\n&gt; a client can easily get to the other format. Similarly, if the French\n&gt; speaking reader visits the site he is automatically (provided his\n&gt; browser is setup properly) presented the french version of the\n&gt; article. If this was not the case and since the French version was\n&gt; undervalued (due to the lack of links pointing to it), he might have\n&gt; ended up finding the English version through a search engine and then\n&gt; would have to choose (using a non-standard way) the French version.\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/ \n&gt; evaluation.htm#sec_6_2_1\n&gt; [2] http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-webarch-20041215/#URI-persistence\n&gt; [3] http://sandeep.shetty.in/2006/04/browserland-http.html\n&gt;\nWhat you describe sound to me like the approach envisioned by the  \nHTTP designers when they designed content negotiation, and in Roy  \nFielding&#39;s dissertation when he discusses REST. I would contest your  \nstatement, &quot;a client can easily get to the other format,&quot; and suggest  \nthat is the main usability problem with content negotiation as  \nenvisioned in the HTTP spec and REST.\n\nIn both examples you give, I believe users want to be able to chose  \nbetween representations. Most users don&#39;t understand request headers,  \nor how to set their preferences. With a bit of looking around, I  \nfound how to do it in my main browser, Firefox on the Mac. So being a  \nsomewhat sophisticated surfer, I could set my preference for French  \nahead of English.\n\nNow imagine I click on your [1] footnote to see a section of Roy  \nFielding&#39;s dissertation, and being true to itself, it sends back a  \nFrench translation of that chapter of his dissertation. Well, even  \nthough I normally prefer French while surfing, in this case, imagine  \nI&#39;m doing research for a paper of my own I&#39;m writing and I really  \nwant the English version, because that&#39;s the authoritative version:  \nthe version of record. To get it, I would need to go to my browser  \nsettings and move English above French, then click reload. Then go  \nback to my preferences to move French back on top, which is what I  \nprefer most of the time. The problem is that most users will have no  \nidea how to solve that problem, and for those sophisticated users who  \ndo, it is a pain.\n\nWhat I&#39;m planning to do at Artima is send back the English version,  \nbut with a prominent link to the French version. If you really prefer  \nthe French version, it is one click away. So I do content negotiation  \nin that when I notice the user prefers French over English, and they  \nhave requested an English article for which there is a French  \ntranslation, I send them a representation of the English article that  \nincludes a prominent link to the French translation. This allows the  \nuser to indicate his or her preference with a mouse click rather than  \ngoing in and editing preferences, which is more user-friendly.\n\nThe situation with HTML and PDF representations of an article, which  \nyou also described, is similar. Although je ne parle pas Francais, I  \ndo use both PDF and HTML, so I can use myself as an example user. I  \nprefer HTML for on screen reading, but PDF for printing. For longer  \nwritten works--article length and longer--I prefer to print and read  \non paper. I have printed Roy Fielding&#39;s thesis out, for example. I  \nwould have preferred to actually get a PDF version of that thesis for  \nprinting, but I didn&#39;t see one. Since I prefer HTML most of the time,  \nfor me to get the PDF version I suppose I&#39;d have to go change my  \npreferences and put PDF ahead of HTML (except I don&#39;t see any way to  \ndo that in Firefox.) But that preference change would be just for his  \nthesis, and only if I happen to be interested in printing it. When  \nfollowing one of your footnotes to Roy&#39;s dissertation from an email,  \nfor example, I actually just prefer the HTML version because I want  \nto read a few paragraphs on screen. Even if I want to read a whole  \nchapter, I only want the PDF if I&#39;m near a printer and have enough  \nink and paper. So at Artima, my plan is to show the HTML version of  \nan article, and include a link on it to a PDF version.\n\nThe problem with the envisioned HTTP/RESTful approach to content  \nnegotiation is that different human language representations of an  \narticle such as French/English, and file format differences such as  \nHTML/PDF, are not information commodities to users. You can&#39;t just  \nreplace one with the other. It does matter to the user which one you  \ngive them, and what they want depends on the situation. The server  \nneeds to negotiate with the *user*, not the user agent, to figure out  \nwhat representation they want in each specific situation. For non- \ncommodities, I believe the best way to do that is to give them a  \ndifferent URI for each, because then the user can express his or her  \nwishes with a click.\n\nSome things that I can imagine doing as-envisioned content  \nnegotiation on are things that really are information commodities  \nfrom the perspective of the user, such as PNG and GIF. Either one you  \nsend should provide the user with the same experience, and the user  \nprobably doesn&#39;t care which one the browser uses to construct the  \nimage it displays. So here it seems fine to me to do content  \nnegotiation as envisioned by HTTP. Note that in this case, what you  \nare really negotiating with is the user agent, not the user.\n\nOne place I&#39;m not sure which way to go is with a version of a URI fit  \nfor small screens, such as Blackberries. I could just adjust the page  \nwhen I guess from the request that they are on a small screen, or I  \ncould include a link to a small screen version. But that would really  \nmean there&#39;s two different sets of pages, one for desktop computers  \nand laptops, and one for mobile devices. I haven&#39;t figured out what  \nto do in this case, but I think that allowing access from mobile  \ndevices will be important, and suspect that just sending the same  \nthing to big and small screens won&#39;t make users happy. I welcome  \nsuggestions.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nEditor-in-Chief\nArtima Developer\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n"}}
