Obviously, a \n&gt; RESTful system should not require a MOVE verb, and the \n&gt; operation can be carried out as follows (assume that the \n&gt; representation already exists):\n\nAnswer 1:\nIt is a bad idea to &quot;MOVE&quot; resources. You aren&#39;t ever really moving\nthem. You are creating another resource with the same state, and making\nthe original resource a redirect to the new one. While that might result\nin an owl:sameAs equivalence between the resources... you generally\nshould be asking yourself why you need to do this.\n\nA resource&#39;s url should normally contain as little information as\npossible: Only enough to identify it. When you change its url you are\nchanging its identification, and changing the resource. While this might\nmake sense in a document publishing world where you just want to edit\nyour blog, it is usually a bad idea in the machine-to-machine REST\npractice.\n\nAnswer 2:\n\nAs per your instructions:\n--&gt;\n&gt; GET /foo.txt\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;--\n&gt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n&gt; ETag: &quot;hash&quot;\n&gt; Content-Type: text/plain\n&gt; Content-Length: 16\n&gt; \n&gt; this is the body\n&gt; \n&gt; --&gt;\n&gt; PUT /bar.txt\n&gt; If-None-Match: *\n&gt; Content-Type: text/plain\n&gt; Content-Length: 16\n&gt; \n&gt; this is the body\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;--\n&gt; HTTP/1.1 201 Created\n&gt; \n&gt; --&gt;\n&gt; DELETE /foo.txt\n&gt; If-Match: &quot;hash&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;--\n&gt; HTTP/1.1 204 No Content\n\nThen:\n\n--&gt;\nPUT /.htaccess HTTP/1.1\n(headers)\n\nredirectMatch permanent ^/foo.txt$ /bar.txt\n\n&lt;--\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\n\nThis is the right-way-to-do-it(tm) in REST style. Don&#39;t introduce new\nmethods to deal with &quot;properties&quot;. Instead, interact with a resource (in\nthis case the .htaccess file) that defines those properties. Use a\ncontent-type that is understood by this resource to define the\nproperties. Technically you should probably be registering the format of\nthat htaccess file with the iana and making its content an rfc, but that\nis the only place this approach really falls short.\n\nAs for MOVE... well that has been covered. Don&#39;t use it. You have no\nright to assume that the server you send the MOVE to will be able to\noperate on the two identified resources simultaneously. It could be a\nmashup of several different services. MOVE introduces unnecessary\ncoupling, let alone its other failures already noted in this and other\nthreads. Its benefits do not outweigh its problems.\n\nBenjamin.\n\n\n\n"}}
