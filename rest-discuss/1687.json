Would it be built upon an HTTP\n&gt; infrastructure or upon a WebDAV infrastructure? I do not know WebDAV as\n&gt; well as I should or will. But I&#39;m thinking that for instance it could be\n&gt; useful for all REST applications to support WebDAV&#39;s notion of\n&gt; collections so that you would get compatibility with WebDAV collection\n&gt; management tools &quot;for free&quot;. If a REST app has to do locking, it might\n&gt; as well use WebDAV locking. If it has to do object versioning, it might\n&gt; as well use WebDAV versioning.\n&gt; \n&gt; Opinions?\n&gt; \n\nI have been lurking on this list for a while and have come to similar \nconclusions about WebDAV. I don&#39;t claim to fully understand all the \nideas of REST and WebDAV, or if all parts of WebDAV are compliant to \nRESTs architectural style, but i might as well throw caution to the wind \nand jot down some opinions/hunches on WebDAV!\n\nPROPFIND: I presume this has the same non-side-effects as GET. Maybe \nsome of the resources defined as metadata could be compressed into or be \nreferenced as properties of a resource e.g. service descriptions. The \nproblem of &#39;what does this resource do?&#39; may be partially resolved if \nthere was a standard property on the resource defining a link to WSDL or \nRDF document.\n\nPROPPATCH: Could be used to prime a resource with appropriate meta-data \nbefore commiting it for processing.\n\nNamespace manipulation: Once a resource has been primed it could be \ncommited for processing by simply moving it to another collection.\n\nACLS: May solve some of the issues discussed about principles. Could it \nallow for the use of one collection resource for all users viewing their \npurchase orders? Users would only get resources for the purchase orders \nthey have permision to view.\n\nBindings and redirection (a bit like resource symbolic links): Could \nallow for multiple views of the collections e.g. allowing for &#39;Cabinets&#39; \nconcept you mention in the &#39;Reinventing Email using REST&#39; article.\n\n\n&gt; Let&#39;s presume I&#39;m right. If you were building a REST app today, is there\n&gt; a good WebDAV toolkit out there that is especially designed to be really\n&gt; easy to extend? Zope? 4Suite? Something in Java? mod_dav?\n&gt;\n\nI have had experience with neon (prototyping WebDAV support for \nStarOffice) and Slide (adding rysnc and rproxy support for HTTP GET to \nthe Slide HTTP/WebDAV layer and client). My view is that the WebDAV bits \nare simply extentions to the HTTP bits. With Slide the WebDAV and HTTP \nbits, encapsulated in a servlet, sit on top of a content management \nsystem which is capable of supporting most the WebDAV features such as \nlocking, ACLs and basic versioning in addition to supporting features \nnot in WebDAV (AFAIK) like transactions (although the WebDAV DeltaV may \noffer some aspects of this since i think it deals with sets of resources \nand is designed to offer functionality similar to that of CVS).\n\n\n\nI really liked you article about email and REST. When i was implementing \nan IPP (Internet Printing Protocol) client i thought this type of thing \ncould be done using WebDAV. Print queues and jobs all fit nicely in the \nresource and collection concepts and properties can be accessed using \nPROPFIND and PROPPATCH; i rekon the IPP model can be represented as a \nset of properties on resources (IPP does have distinct URIs for queues \nand jobs but binary messages are POSTed, with methods encapsulated in \nthe message). The perhaps thorny issue of IPP print job notification \nfits nicely into the unification of news/email ideas that you presented.\n\nWith hindsite it annoys me that i had to implement a binary protocol on \ntop of HTTP that tunneled through HTTP using POST. There were extentions \nto HTTP that i think could of done the job just as well, if not better, \nthat reused existing, well proven, resources and concepts and could gain \nfrom their future advances.\n\nSome speculation: perhaps if the IPP group used WebDAV and the REST \nstyle then this alternative way of printing could of achieved a faster \ntime to market.\n\nAll the other nice features sort of fall in place, just like for REST \nemail; it kind of makes me smile when i see how elegent these systems \ncould be :-) and also makes me frustrated that they are currently not :-(\n\nMaybe REST printing could become another use case along side REST email.\n\nThanks,\nPaul.\n\n-- \n| ? + ? = To question\n----------------&#92;\n    Paul Sandoz\n         x19219\n+353-1-8199219\n\n\n\n"}}
