No session required.\n&gt; \n&gt; I wonder how far you could take &quot;file upload&quot; in this direction?  \nAnd/or\n&gt; some Javascript to provide the local containers ...  Hmm.\n\nPersonally, I&#39;d advise against forcing the client to maintain state \nand particularly potentially sensitive data like a shopping. It \nrestricts what your client can do and it just invites all sorts of \nsecurity breaches.\n\nThe way I maintain session in some apps is simply to expose \na /sessions/ resource. The session of each individual user is stored \nbelow this, usually just by appending a user-id to the /sessions/ \nresource -- eg /sessions/3423423423/ would be my session. This simple \narchitecture has a lot of benefits. Particularly, I can create a \nsession on one computer in the red building and then walk over to my \nlab and retrieve my previous session.\n\nThe real problem is not necessarily maintaining session, but \nidentifying new users and returning users. There really is no clean \nway to do this and it&#39;s a big drawback of HTTP. The solutions are:\n\n1) Use HTTP digest authentication. If the user doesn&#39;t authenticate \nthen they become the generic &#39;Anonymous User&#39; and no session state \nwill be maintained for them.\n\n2) Use cookies. Simple and cheap, and it doesn&#39;t require you to \ncreate accounts for each user, especially for anonymous users. For \nexample, it&#39;s often the case that you want to maintain state for a \nclient without forcing that client to login. Cookies let you do this. \nCookies do complicate your client code since developers creating non-\nbrowser apps must understand cookies.\n\n3) Create a session ID and embed it in the URI. This is very simple \nbut it has a lot of problems. Users can no longer bookmark URLs and \nevery URL exposed to the user must be &#39;sessionified&#39;.\n\nMy suggestion:\n\nJust use cookies. I know Fielding says cookies are non-restful, but \nthere&#39;s really no better way. It&#39;s what they&#39;re there for.\n\nNote that just because a user has a cookie should not grant that user \nextra permissions. Cookies aren&#39;t an authentication mechanism. If a \nuser needs to perform some security-sensitive mechansim then you \nshould make them login using digest authentication. The great thing \nabout http digest authentication (whether Fielding admits it or not) \nis that it&#39;s essentially a standardized cookie/session-id. The user \nis required to authenticate themself with every request so you get \nall the benefits of cookie plus security.\n\n- inthedarkplace\n\n\n"}}
