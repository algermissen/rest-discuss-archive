Any change to this \n&gt; entry point (i.e. it responds with a 301) could be handled as \n&gt; described above.\n&gt;\n&gt; You are making the entry point URI vs. transitional URI distinction I \n&gt; raised back in Feb:\n&gt;\n&gt;     It seems that perhaps there is an implicit REST constraint that is\n&gt;     beginning to become more explicit. Roughly, REST distinguishes two\n&gt;     types of URIs:\n&gt;\n&gt;        1. &quot;entry point&quot; type URIs, which may be bookmarked\n&gt;           indefinitely. These are Cool URIs.\n&gt;        2. &quot;transitional&quot; type URIs, which may not be bookmarked\n&gt;           indefinitely. These are unCool URIs. I call then\n&gt;           &quot;transitional&quot; given that their role is typically to enable\n&gt;           transition to the next state.\n&gt;\n&gt;     I&#39;m not wedded to the names (you could call them\n&gt;     internal/external), but I do think this distinction between types\n&gt;     of URIs is an important aspect of REST that, so far, has not been\n&gt;     clearly outlined. It certainly seems to be in play in the\n&gt;     permathread debates regarding whether &quot;URIs should be RESTful or\n&gt;     not&quot; (and whether that designation is even a meaningful one). I\n&gt;     also think the distinction is a bit at odds with the common\n&gt;     understanding of URIs on the Web that ANY URI should be a\n&gt;     bookmarkable URI, ie that ALL URIs should strive to be Cool.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Feel free to make such a distinction, but acknowledge that such a \n&gt; distinction goes against the Web ethos that ALL URIs should be cool \n&gt; (ie should not change) not just entry point URIs.\n&gt;\n&gt; In other words, REST seems to imply that only entry point URIs need be \n&gt; cool, while Web Architecture implies that ALL URI should be cool. \n&gt; Someone should justify the (sexual) tension between these principles.\n\nI don&#39;t, personally, make any distinction. Entry point URIs are exactly \nthe same as any other URI; where the identified resource can be moved \nand subsequently indicated to clients with a 301 response.\n\nIs a URI that begins responding with a 301 to a new location considered \n&#39;uncool&#39; as of that point? I think it&#39;s very cool to let clients know \nthat! :)\n\n- Mike\n\n"}}
