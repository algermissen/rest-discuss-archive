Rather it is \n&gt; the same art-school idiocy that has hobbled the Web ever since Marc \n&gt; Andreesen added the img tag to HTML in 1993. \n\nHarsh words. It&#39;s them image tags wot&#39;s been payin&#39; our wages for so\nlong. Go ask the designer of Gopher.\n\n\n&gt; Designers, not users but \n&gt; designers, get upset that the username and password dialog doesn&#39;t fit \n&gt; their site&#39;s carefully constructed look and feel (one that more often \n&gt; than not doesn&#39;t look like they expect on any system except their own \n&gt; anyway). Users generally couldn&#39;t care less about this. They just want \n&gt; to log in, get their work done, and forget about the whole \n&gt; username/password mess.\n\nCan you point me to the survey that suggests that? Most of the users I\nknow would rather not login at all. That&#39;s why they like cookies.\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt; and security issues (can&#39;t tell the client to &quot;log them  \n&gt;&gt; off&quot; once authenticated, or force the client to ask for the name and  \n&gt;&gt; password again). \n&gt;\n&gt; Now that&#39;s a real issue and one I&#39;m surprised hasn&#39;t been fixed yet.\n\nNo. It isn&#39;t really. Authentication is not a session. Once you\nauthenticate in a stateless system, you authenticate. No need to log\nout.\n\nOf course, whether there is a session is one of those things\nprogrammers, not users but programmers, get upset about  /8-&gt;\n\n\nSeriously I think it&#39;s better to accept cookies because at least they\ncan be used by the client side code.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
