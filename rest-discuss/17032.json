A while ago, on this forum or maybe it was\n&gt; the Jersey forum..can&#39;t remember, a few people were asking something about\n&gt; if their API would be considered a true RESTful aPI.

Somehow, that&#39;s like Steve Jobs\n&gt; saying Java is bad and now a crap load of apple people think Java is bad.\n&gt; Hopefully not many with our technical knowledge will read something like\n&gt; that and just assume a given API being blogged about is no good now..\n&gt; because it&#39;s not 100% RESTful according to Roy or some others.

So, at least for me, that is why I am messing\n&gt; around with this on the side, making a toy bid site, trying to see if I can\n&gt; provide a truly RESTful api that clients can consume, evolve without\n&gt; breaking clients, and follows HATEOAS. Thus my struggle with the notion of\n&gt; using XHTML instead of my own XML. Ugh!\n&gt;\n&gt;\nI like using xhtml.  However, most of the m2m situations i encounter require\nthe introduction of a new media type.  That media type will, often, be xhtml\nbut with some additions rules applied.  (Eg, that every div with a class of\n&quot;person&quot; can be interpreted as a person.)  Making the latent semantics\nexplicit with a specific media type id allows for more graceful evolution of\nthe clients and servers.  Using xhtml as the basis for your m2m interactions\nreduces duplication.  The `application/html` and `application/vnd.myapp`\nrepresentations are usually identical.  The vendor media type merely informs\nautomaton clients there this are some application specific semantics to the\ndocument they are receiving.\n\nHowever, if you think selling xhtml to your consumers as service format will\nbe hard just use xml or json.  There is nothing wrong with that as long as\nyou register an id for your new media type.\n\nPeter\nbarelyenough.org\n\r\n--0016367b645259134f049686eb36\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Fri, Dec 3, 2010 at 12:03 PM, Kevin D=\r\nuffey &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:andjarnic@...&quot;&gt;andjarni=\r\nc@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); =\r\npadding-left: 1ex;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;table border=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=3D&quot;0=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot; valign=3D&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;Peter,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\nI think this is what some of the other responses have been about.. if you u=\r\nse a media-type like xhtml, then any client will know what all elements ret=\r\nurned mean. &lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do you mean, f=\r\nor example, the server returns an `application/xhtml` response to a client =\r\nexpecting a search results response and the client knows that in that type =\r\nof response each div with a class of &quot;person&quot; constitutes a perso=\r\nn that can have acquaintances. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;If you do mean that then you have a=\r\n real problem. =A0 Clients should not need out of band information to inter=\r\npret the messages they receive.=A0 The `content-type` header is designed to=\r\n convey all the information needed to interpret the message.=A0 If you use =\r\n&#39;content-type&#39; correctly&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;=\r\ngmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; border-left: 1px solid rgb=\r\n(204, 204, 204); padding-left: 1ex;&quot;&gt;&lt;table border=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; =\r\ncellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot; valign=3D&quot;top&quot;&gt;\nH=\r\nowever, that still leads to the question another poster had made.. it&#39;s=\r\n not guaranteed that a consumer of the api will always work.
