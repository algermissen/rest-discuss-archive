The labels then change to REST and\n&gt; SOAP, representing the evolution of the two viewpoints (My assertion is\n&gt; if you&#39;re an HTML & Web App person, REST seems natural. Similarly, if\n&gt; you&#39;re used to DCOM, CORBA, etc. SOAP seems fine & dandy). The circles\n&gt; then move to overlap partially, and a question-mark appear in the\n&gt; overlap area. This represents the point of intersection of the 2 models,\n&gt; which is also one of the pain points. I don&#39;t believe this is a\n&gt; coincidence. The thesis for my talk is that this area of intersection\n&gt; (called RESTful SOAP) is actually a good thing, as it provides an\n&gt; opportunity for SOAP to learn valuable architectural lessons from REST,\n&gt; and an opportunity for REST to benefit from SOAP&#39;s widespread acceptance\n&gt; among corporate developers.\n\nI think you did a good job in the presentation of staying away from\nsuggesting that the term &quot;SOAP&quot; suggested a use, but here you appear to\ndo just that.\n\nSOAP is certainly well deployed, but the problem is that &quot;SOAP&quot; means\n&quot;RPC&quot; (either explicitly or implicitly) to practically everybody who\nuses it.  And while I&#39;m all for using SOAP with REST - indeed, I spent\na substantial amount of time and my own money in the XMLP WG ensuring\nthat I could - I don&#39;t think that &quot;widespread acceptance&quot; is sufficient\nwhen it&#39;s being misused.  We need a *MASSIVE* educational campaign to\nfix this.  And IMO, it&#39;s too late; just look at all the secondary specs\nwritten by the supposed *gurus* of Web services; chroeography,\ntransactions, coordination.  All crap.  If these people don&#39;t understand\nthe mistake they&#39;re making, how will a regular developer?\n\nLike you, about a year ago I was still optimistic that SOAP had a\nchance because I expected more people to recognize the error of their\nways by now.  I&#39;ve since given up.  Already people are asking &quot;Where\nare the Web services?&quot; - that question will be asked more and more in\nthe coming year, until finally, nobody cares.\n\nP.S.  I think the circles are concentric, with REST&#39;s circle being of\nradius X, and SOAP&#39;s being of radius X*1.01.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile.
