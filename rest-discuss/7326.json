I think it was Henrik that\n&gt; introduced me to it. Also, I like keeping two distinct vocabularies\n&gt; around: blueprint vs. class, service vs. instance, verb+signature vs.\n&gt; method. It reduces confusion when talking about both concepts\n&gt; simultaneously.\n\nMy preference would be to have one shared vocabulary, especially since they\nare so synergistic.  It would seem that a smaller volcabulary would be less\nconfusing, but to each his own.\n\n&gt; Ah yes, the ugly &#39;@&#39; prefix. It&#39;s to avoid naming clashes between\n&gt; built-in and custom URIs. Maybe we should have used &#39;.&#39;. \n\nI definitely wouldn&#39;t use something that requires encoding.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n\n\n\n"}}
