In the above example, it seems like the server is free to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; decide whether to send application/xml, application/xhtml+xml or\n&gt;&gt;&gt; text/html.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Any opinions on that? Should it be followed left to right\n&gt;&gt;&gt; (application/xml first)? Should the server decide?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Does this, from section 14, not apply here?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; No, that refers to text/html;level=1 having precedence over text/html\n&gt; because the former is more specific than the latter.\n\nI thought that was just an example.  I read it to be &quot;the most\nspecific reference has precedence&quot; - is &quot;most specific&quot; not defined by\nthe media type itself here?  For example, I read rfc3023 to mean that\na type with a +xml should be considered &#39;more specific&#39; than the\ngeneric xml.  At least, it indicates that in section 7, but further\nconfusing me it says in the appendix that they should be considered\nopaque and independent. If you have pointers to something that\nexplains this better, I&#39;d appreciate it...\n\nThanks,\n--tim\n\n"}}
