This leaves us with a subjective test.\n\nUnfortunately this is unavoidable. Similarly in an OO language you would \nsay that important resources should be represented as objects (as \nopposed to being embedded in strings, for example).\n\n&gt; I take it from your response that you believe user-specific\n&gt; resources are not &quot;important&quot; and that you see no value in the\n&gt; example offered by Vincent D. Murphy?\n\nNot at all. My point is that if Roy defines a service and says that the \nURI &quot;/mybooks&quot; represents the current user&#39;s books and that is a single \nresource then consumers have to treat that as the defined interface. You \ncan&#39;t argue &quot;really that&#39;s two resources&quot;. It isn&#39;t. It is one resource \nthat happens to serve very different representations to different users. \nBut you could _separately_ make an engineering argument that it would be \nmore useful if there were multiple resources. Sure, given a set of goals \nand requirements for a system that is probably the right engineering \nchoice. My point was that it is not productive for two people to argue \nwhether a given URL has N or M resources behind it.\n\nMy rule of thumb is that the thing has multiple resources behind it if \nyou have to invent a new addressing scheme to talk about the things, and \nyou start embedding those addresses in XML documents or passing them \naround as parameters to APIs etc.\n\n&gt; As for the original example, if the application is designed\n&gt; without user-specific resource URLs, it will not be possible to\n&gt; even link to cities created by other users. Ah well, foreign\n&gt; travel is overrated anyways.\n\nI would presume that every city has its own URL and the only question is \nwhether every user is allowed to see every city or whether they get an \nauthorization complaint. That&#39;s why I think that the discussion about \nuser-specific URLs is a little bit of a tangent.\n\n&gt; 1. REST states that important resources should have a URI.\n\nGreat.\n\n&gt; 2. A user-specific resource is an important resource.\n\nGreat.\n\n&gt; 3. HTTP Auth is used to discriminate between user-specific\n&gt; resources.\n\nHTTP auth can be used to do two things. One is to disallow access to a \nresource. The other is to personalize a resource. Let&#39;s say I send you a \nURL for a site that we both have accounts for (Slashdot is a perfect \nexample). It shows up for you with a blue background because of a \npreference you set and it shows up as green for me. This is good from a \nusability point of view: you are seeing the information as you asked for \nit and I am seeing it as I asked for it. It is the same resource.\n\nConversely, it could be quite confusing if the URL behaves totally \ndifferently for me than for you (not just different colours but totally \ndifferent content). On the other hand, if this is part of the contract \nof the resource (&quot;We use your user name as the seed for a random number \ngenerator before we generate you a random quote&quot;) then fair enough.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
