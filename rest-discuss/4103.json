(Re Msg# 1418, 3094)\n\nTo summarise, what has been talked about is a REST-compliant HTTP\ntoolkit, but because of the limitations of todays clients, many\ntoolkits tend to compromise REST and make all interfaces use GET or\nPOST.\n\nI would like to propose elements of a broader definition of something\nto help development and deployment of REST-oriented systems. This\nwould include:\n\n*) HTTP compliant but not HTTP oriented\n\n*) equally suitable for machine-machine and machine-human(browser)\n\n*) equally suitable acting as a client, a server, or a peer in a\nnetwork.\n\n*) the REST paradigm could be applied internally as way of making\nmodular, scalable and decoupled applications, not just on the network\ninterface.\n\n*) although REST doesn&#39;t dictate the use of XML, accept that XML is\nthe defacto-standard universal data syntax and use it for all\nmeta-data and as as the lingua-franca between all other\nrepresentations.\n\n-- \nTony Butterfield &lt;tab@...&gt;\n1060 Research\n\n\n\n"}}
