The expectation is the semantics, not the mechanism.  So\nif there&#39;s a connector semantic called &quot;GET_STOCK_QUOTE&quot; which provides\nthe expectation that when I submit a document which describes an\nexchange/symbol tuple, any response I get will necessarily be a quote\nfor that stock, then that&#39;s the expectation I&#39;m talking about.   And if\nthat&#39;s what is expected, then a) the semantic isn&#39;t uniform, and b) the\nnon-uniform semantic isn&#39;t made explicit in the message and is therefore\nnot self-descriptive.\n\n&quot;Document oriented SOA&quot; - which I assume you&#39;re a fan of based on this\nline of argument - ignores that expectation, but cannot escape from it.\nWhat it recommends is hiding the operation altogether, and just treating\nWeb services as document exchange endpoints; document in, document out.\nWhat it fails to acknowledge is that Web service clients sending\ndocuments have different expectations per endpoint, and therefore\ndifferent (and therefore non-uniform) connector semantics.\n\n&gt; Also,\n&gt; &quot;All REST interactions are stateless. That is, each request contains all of the\n&gt; information necessary for a connector to understand the request, independent of\n&gt; any requests that may have preceded it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; So when you say:\n&gt; &quot;No, the POST invocation isn&#39;t RESTful by itself.  In the examples people have\n&gt; given, the client expects that a particular POST invocation will result in a\n&gt; resource being created (and furthermore, that this resource will have a\n&gt; particular relationship to the POSTed representation).&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; It is the user that has the expectations and not the client and the\n&gt; &quot;relationship to the POSTed representation&quot; that you speak off does not exist\n&gt; as the interaction is stateless. The client is expecting only &quot;response control\n&gt; data, optional resource metadata, and an optional representation.&quot;\n\nAgain, it&#39;s the semantics, not the mechanism.\n\n&gt; Also when you say:\n&gt; &quot;resources cannot be expected to process, say, XQuery documents and return the\n&gt; results of the specified query in the POST response, or in the form of another\n&gt; resource, or anyplace else for that matter, since providing such an expectation\n&gt; is not uniform.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; HTTP doesnt need to know that you are performing a Query-over-POST just as it\n&gt; does not need to know that you are annotating an existing resources or Posting\n&gt; a message to a bulletin board.\n\nI&#39;m not sure what you mean by that.  How does HTTP &quot;know&quot; anything?\n\n&gt; And according to http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9\n&gt; &quot;The actual function performed by the POST method is determined by the server\n&gt; and is usually dependent on the Request-URI.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; and,\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;If a resource has been created on the origin server, the response SHOULD be 201\n&gt; (Created) and contain an entity which describes the status of the request and\n&gt; refers to the new resource, and a Location header&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The fact that the above statement begins with a &quot;If&quot; itself signifies that the\n&gt; client does not need to know anything more than dealing with the appropriate\n&gt; &quot;response control data, optional resource metadata, and an optional\n&gt; representation&quot; and therefore signifies that the interface is uniform.\n\nRESTfully, response messages would be self-descriptive and able to be\ninterpreted independent of the request message, yes.  But that says\nnothing about request semantics which is what is constrained to be\nuniform AIUI.\n\nAgain, you seem to be focusing on mechanism, not semantics; it goes\nwithout saying that a sender of an HTTP request message should expect\na response message.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
