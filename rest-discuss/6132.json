What OS and filesystem is the server \nrunning, or are you using an XML DB instead of a filesystem? Some servers \nwill handle your PUT to /a by creating a resource named &#39;a&#39; (a file with no \nextension) in the root directory, while others won&#39;t allow that due to the \npresence of a directory named /a/. \n\n&quot;rfc2616 9.6 implies that the server consider it a modification to the \nexisting resource. With a file system that doesn&#39;t really make sense?&quot; \n\nIf the GET method is used to access directory /a/ what generates the \nresponse? If the httpd is set up as a file server and returns a directory \nlisting, that doesn&#39;t make sense as the target of a PUT so go with a 400 \nresponse, as Elliote advised. \n\nIf, on the other hand, that response is generated by something like \nindex.jsp then my reading of 9.6 suggests that the server may 301-redirect a \nPUT request to /a/index.jsp -- &quot;the user agent MAY then make its own \ndecision regarding whether or not to redirect the request&quot;. The index.jsp \nscript can decide how to handle the PUT request. \n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n"}}
