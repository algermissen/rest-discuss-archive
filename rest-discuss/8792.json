He was smarter than me, so I&#39;ll tentatively\n&gt; believe it.\n\nI&#39;ve seen a paper that said Paxos was the same protocol as 2PC for some \nnumber of actors; I don&#39;t know if that means 2PC is generally \nunavoidable. The general theorem I know of is the 5 packet handshake. \nFor 5PH to work some cases need to be excluded to avoid &quot;byzantine \ngenerals&quot; kinds of problems, and you might need to make some assumptions \n(such as an &quot;eventual arrival&quot; if the channel is asymmetric). I liked it \nbecause it applies directly to point to point messaging problems with an \nunreliable channel (which is most reliable messaging scenarios).\n\n&gt; Compensation is extremely difficult in many (maybe most) cases. Can\n&gt; you really undo all of the effects of a set of distributed actions?\n\nYou don&#39;t need to. Design an exception management system that kicks it \nout to a person to decide how to resolve it. They can roll forward.\n\n\n&gt; In REST, probably uses a separate transaction resource, or at least\n&gt; that&#39;s true of all the RESTful transaction proposals I&#39;ve seen on this\n&gt; list or in the recent book.\n\nYep. For an exchange of value it&#39;s useful if the state of the exchange \nhas separate identity to the thing of value. If there was a design \npatterns book for the Web, this would be one of them.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
