I personally have found the &quot;addressing&quot; argument much more\npersuasive and easy to understand, so that is MY focus, even though it\nis not, er, addressed on the front of the Wiki.\n\nAlso, I have long been concerned that the focus on a &quot;small set of\nverbs&quot; misses the point that it is not the small set that is central but\nrather their generality and commonality. Four, six, ten, fifty. It\ndoesn&#39;t matter much as long as they are general.\n\nI&#39;ve also come over time to see this argument as incomplete:\n\n&quot;Another way of saying this is that REST works because it keeps\ninterface complexity from scaling with N^2. In an infinite world of\nuncoordinated (i.e., independently developed) objects that interact with\none another using specialized interfaces, the interface &quot;connection&quot;\ncomplexity is order N^2, because each object can have a unique interface\nto each other object. An infinite world of uncoordinated objects that\nshare a common, generic interface, on the other hand, has only a\ncomplexity of order N, because no matter how many objects there are,\nthey will all be able to act on one another in predictable ways.&quot;\n\nLet&#39;s be more explicit, we are pushing complexity around and hopefully\nreducing it but not competely changing its order notation. We are not\ngoing to take a purchase order client system and plug it into a content\nmanagement system and expect them to just understand each other anytime\nsoon. My sense is that REST helps by *centralizing* the\nincompatibilities in the vocabulary and stanardizating *as much as can\nbe standradized* (which is certainly addressing and secondarily method\nnames).\n\nAnd what I really meant when I said that the term REST had evolved\nincluded this noun/verb stuff but also \n\n a) the emphasis on addressing which is more implicit in Roy&#39;s writing, \n\n b) the sense that it is a competitor to web services\n\n c) the sense that it should even be used for web-service-like stuff\n(Roy has never said that to me...maybe he doesn&#39;t agree or maybe he just\ndoesn&#39;t care)\n\n d) many of the best practices we send around which really are about\n&quot;how to build applications on a REST framework&quot; as opposed to &quot;what is\nREST&quot; (the difference between OO languages and OO design).\n\nBTW, in case anyone cares, ;), I am about to run off for the weekend but\nI&#39;m downloading REST-related pages to do some writing and thinking about\nsession handling, OO+REST etc.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
