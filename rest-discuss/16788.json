I wasn&#39;t attempting to =\r\ninvent a new term for server states as Larry Masinter suggests in the linke=\r\nd email.\n\nI was attempting to make an analogy between the client&#39;s incarnat=\r\nion of the application and a state machine.

Then actions taken by =\r\nthe client/UserAgent via links are the state transitions.  \n\nAm I understan=\r\nding things poorly?  Is that a bad analogy?\n\n...or am I relating my underst=\r\nanding poorly?\n\nPerhaps I should revise the blog post to make it clear that=\r\n the analogy to state machine is to be drawn to the user agent&#39;s hypermedia=\r\n workspace?
