I&#39;m won=\r\ndering about RFC 5988, which says very little about how to process links ot=\r\nher than the word &quot;dereference&quot; (4 times) which might imply using a safe me=\r\nthod to GET something.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Are Link: headers and &lt;atom:link&gt; elements p=\r\nrimarily designed to support navigation using safe methods?\n\nGood question.=\r\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Are there any link relations out there that have processing instruct=\r\nions that say &quot;POST to me to do this&quot; or something similarly unsafe?  I&#39;m o=\r\nnly aware of atom&#39;s &quot;edit&quot; link relation, which says something about GET an=\r\nd PUT, but that&#39;s the exception, and in any case you typically start by GET=\r\n&#39;ing it anyway, so you&#39;re still dereferencing the link.\n\nThe meaning of &#39;ed=\r\nit&#39; is more like: &quot;Here is the primary resource for an entry. If you intend=\r\n to change the state of the entry, use this URI&quot;.\n\nThe question of *how* yo=\r\nu do that is up to your intentions - Atompub merely gives a hint to how tha=\r\nt might be done.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Atom uses the &lt;app:collection&gt; element to indicate t=\r\nhat you can POST entries to a collection;\n\nAgain, &lt;app:collection&gt; is telli=\r\nng you something about the nature of the resource. The POST thing is merely=\r\n a hint (even atompub cannot constrain servers in any way beyond HTTP). Thi=\r\nnk of the POST thing as a hint to implementors how it SHOULD be done on bot=\r\nh sides.\n\n&gt; HTML uses the &lt;form&gt; element...  Again, shunning links when it =\r\ncomes to &quot;unsafety&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Are links inherently meant to be safe links?\n\nNo,=\r\n I do not think so.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; RFC 4287 says: &quot;The value of &quot;rel&quot; describes the =\r\nmeaning of the link, but does not impose any behavioral requirements on Ato=\r\nm Processors.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Does this mean that the documentation of any given rel =\r\ncan NOT say anything about how a link should be used?\n\nYes, indeed; link re=\r\nl specs cannot constrain servers to behave in a special way. It can provide=\r\n hints though.  But in the end, the server is always free to do what it wan=\r\nts and the client needs to expect that.\n\nUsually, these &#39;how&#39;-things do not=\r\n change frequently. See my last mail on configuration time.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; On the ot=\r\nher hand, RFC 5988 (which updates 4287) says: &quot;Relation types [...] can spe=\r\ncify the behaviours and properties of the target resource (e.g., allowable =\r\nHTTP methods, request and response media types that must be supported).&quot;\n\nT=\r\nhat is an over-specification ... which, unfortunately, AtomPub contains in =\r\nmany places (e.g. GET on &lt;app collections&gt; returning application/atom+xml. =\r\nAtomPUb cannot constrain servers in such a way).\n\nJan\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; -mogsi=\r\ne-\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
