What is worth a URI without representation? What does it\n&gt; &gt; identifies?\n&gt;\n&gt; It may feel &quot;strange&quot; like pineapple slices as a pizza topping does to \n&gt; me, but it&#39;s not wrong.\n&gt;\n&gt; The URI is the &quot;pointer&quot; to the resource, not the resource itself. \n&gt; Issuing a DELETE should remove the resource (technically not the URI) \n&gt; and a GET to the resource using that URI should return a 404 (although \n&gt; I could see a use case for 410).\n&gt;\n&gt; Having said all this, I wouldn&#39;t use DELETE.\n&gt;\n&gt; Eb\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
