This plus content n=\r\negotiation makes it possible to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; evolve the service as long you accept t=\r\no teach your client how to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; handle new ressource types (and that is actu=\r\nally RESTful).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Do you think that it is ok for the server to break a p=\r\nreviously\n&gt;&gt; established contract because the client can adapt by re-config=\r\nuring/ \n&gt;&gt; re-\n&gt;&gt; programing it? (Which is what I think you are saying abov=\r\ne).\n&gt;\n&gt; That was not what I was trying to say :-) The server should  \n&gt; cer=\r\ntainly not break expectations - but the client must state it&#39;s  \n&gt; expectat=\r\nions explicitely using content negotiation: if it does not  \n&gt; include appl=\r\nication/order.terroistcheck+xml in it&#39;s accept headers  \n&gt; then the server =\r\nis not allowed to return such ressources.\n\nAh - I am talking about the expe=\r\nctation that is manifested by the code  \nthat populates the accept header. =\r\nNo matter how many media types you  \nput in there, the set of types is base=\r\nd on the assumption that one of  \nthese will be available. This expectation=\r\n is based on design time  \nknowledge. (Which effectively is design time kno=\r\nwledge about the state  \nmachine).\n\nSo, I tried to say: The server must not=\r\n break those design time  \ncontract.\n\n(And I try to argue that this design =\r\ntime contract contradicts the  \nhypermedia constraint).\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Hmmm, makes m=\r\ne think that the accept headers for a big website can  \n&gt; grow to be quite =\r\nlarge! Unless we find a smart naming scheme for the  \n&gt; media types.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yo=\r\nu certainly have to re-program your client if you want it to  \n&gt; recognize =\r\nnew and improved features and ressources.\n&gt;\n&gt; But if a service decides to a=\r\ndd a new mandatory ressource type,  \n&gt; well, then it has to break existing =\r\nclients by explicitely returning  \n&gt; an error code saying &quot;I cannot serve y=\r\nou a ressource type that you  \n&gt; support&quot;. But this is certainly not someth=\r\ning a webshop would like  \n&gt; to do since it means loosing a bunch of custom=\r\ners - exactly like the  \n&gt; human version of the shop would do if it made up=\r\n new features that  \n&gt; humans could not figure out. I would even say this h=\r\nappens all the  \n&gt; time on the human web, it&#39;s just called &quot;bad usability&quot;.=\r\n\n\nYep! But &quot;it is common sense for the service not to evolve  \nincompatibly=\r\n&quot; just does not work inside the enterprise. There, people  \nneed to be spec=\r\nific about the kind of constract that is at work (even  \nif the contract is=\r\n deliberately very loose!) Saying that the server  \nwould not break the cli=\r\nents because it &quot;does not make sense to do so&quot;  \nwill not cause the CIO to =\r\nassign us that budget :-)\n\nAgain: I am not suggesting a strict contract is =\r\nneeded, I am trying to  \nmake explicit the amount of coupling that is reall=\r\ny going on, so  \npeople can make informed decisions.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; By the way: I ha=\r\nve never programmed anything like this, so it&#39;s all  \n&gt; based on assumption=\r\ns (which we all know are the mother of all  \n&gt; fu**ups). But it&#39;s an intere=\r\nsting discussion.\n\nYour mind works very well.
