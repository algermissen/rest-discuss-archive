I wanted to  \n&gt; b=\r\nuild an automatically-generated GUI client that would be able to  \nHi Ernie=\r\n,\n This is quite similar to what I had in mind.I do have a few doubts here.=\r\n\n\nWhat about the HTTP binding in WSDL web services?Would that qualify as\na =\r\nREST service.I know that REST treats URIs as\nresources and doesnt like send=\r\ning parameters in the url encoded\nform,when it actually represents a resouc=\r\ne(not sure about this\nthough),but may be something can be done to make the =\r\nservice more\nRESTfull.HTTP binding in WSDL typically uses HTTP GET and POST=\r\n and\nthats what REST services use too..and this is what I had in mind when\n=\r\nI thought of WSDL.\n\nThe reason I am curious about the description part beca=\r\nuse automatic\nclient side processing of the service can\ntake place.In the w=\r\neb services stack for example you can use a wsdl\ntoolkit to automatically i=\r\nnvoke the webservice by just\nproviding the WSDL file to the tool or probabl=\r\ny generate a client stub\nwith the toolkit.\n\nWhile requests are simple URIs =\r\nin REST services and dont really need a\ndesciption,what about the responses=\r\n?\nMost of them need an xml schema. WSDL has a schema section,so we could\npr=\r\nobably combine the schema,and the uri&#39;s for the\nREST services and provide a=\r\n description for the service.\nSo I can just use the description of the REST=\r\n service to autoinvoke\nthe service,get the response,validate it with the\nsc=\r\nhema provided and provide APIs to access the xml elements or even\ngenerate =\r\na GUI for that automatically as Ernie pointed out.\n\nAlso do REST services h=\r\nave  inputs? Take the example of the Yahoo REST\nservice for video search wh=\r\nose response schema is at\nhttp://api.search.yahoo.com/VideoSearchService/V1=\r\n/VideoSearchResponse.xsd\n\nA typical request for this looks like below.\n\nhtt=\r\np://api.search.yahoo.com/VideoSearchService/V1/videoSearch?appid=3DYahooDem=\r\no&query=3Dmadonna&results=3D1\nSo a toolkit which has a formal description o=\r\nf the REST service could\nprompt for the parameters,&#39;query&#39; and &#39;results&#39;\nDo=\r\nes this make sense?\nSo Its more about automatic description of parameters a=\r\nnd response\ntype than discovery of the service.\n\nFor example it helps to ha=\r\nve  a WSDL in the web services world so you \ncan have a tool which auto gen=\r\nerates a SOAP request from the wsdl and\nunderstands the response.\nwsdl stoc=\r\nks.wsdl getQuote XYZ\nor use it from a stock portfolio appln.so is REST mean=\r\nt to be used in \nother apps like an API or is it just meant for the browser=\r\n?\n\n\n\nCheers!\nVivek Krishna\n~                        \n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
