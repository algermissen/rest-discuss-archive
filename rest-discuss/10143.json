Damien Katz decided to drop XML altogether\n&gt; &lt;http://damienkatz.net/2007/09/system_overload_1.html&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; It seems he doesn&#39;t really like XML at all.

However I&#39;m surprised at his opposition to XML. In \nwhat seems to be the CouchDB use case the primary purpose is to store \nweb pages in a database. This is exactly what XML is for, and exactly \nwhat a native XML database and XQuery are designed to do. That he had \nsome problems using XML as an API substitute does not surprise me, but \nwhy has he then thrown the web page baby out with the RPC bathwater? \nCurious.\n\nThe real question, I suppose, is whether CouchDB supports any \nsubdocument level of granularity. Can you actually search inside \ndocuments, or can you emrely insert and retrieve them by key? What if I \nwant to cut documents apart and put them back together again? Is this \npossible? If not, we&#39;re simply back in the MySQL world where all pages \nare unstructured BLOBs. I spent some time looking through the FAQ and \ndocumentation but I couldn&#39;t figure out how to do this.\n\nOr perhaps I&#39;m just totally misunderstanding the use case? However, \nwithout understanding the structure of the documents CouchDB contains, \nit doesn&#39;t strike me as a modern tool for web site development compared \nto options like eXist and Mark Logic.\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
