What are some use cases where REST should not be used? \nSince I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; advocating a RESTful implementation of Linda tuple spaces, I&#39;d \nlike to\n&gt; &gt; know if my use cases falls into this category!\n&gt; \n&gt; To be honest, probably not. ;) ;(\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s why I say that: REST has its own kind of interaction model, \njust\n&gt; as tuple spaces do. I think that putting one on top of the other \nwill\n&gt; degrade the benefits of both. It is a little like putting objects \nin a\n&gt; relational databases or relations in an object database etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Understanding what those boundaries are (and I can&#39;t think of \nany)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would be very illuminating.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hmmm... No cases where REST should not be used? This sounds like \nreligious\n&gt; &gt; enthusiasm to me....\n&gt; \n&gt; I believe that REST is not appropriate for first person shooters \n(as an\n&gt; example). Performance would be a huge problem in trying to maintain\n&gt; REST&#39;s statelessness. Realtime 3D video games cannot even afford to \nbe\n&gt; &quot;stateless enough&quot; to meet their own security requirements (that&#39;s \nwhy\n&gt; the send extra information before it is needed and that informatio \nis\n&gt; used by cheater software).\n&gt; -- \n&gt;  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
