Bidirectional communications are a real blocking factor.\n\n\n&gt; * efficiency.  Using two sockets instead of one, plus the cost of\n&gt; maintaining open connections, is a brutual efficiency hit.\nI&#39;m not so sure about this - what types/roles are the machines & what\nnumbers of sockets are you thinking of?\nGood sized servers should be able to have 10K open connections without a\nproblem.\n\n&gt; * firewall transgression.  being able to able to establish a server\n&gt; connection to a node behind a firewall, by having the server create the\n&gt; TCP connection but otherwise act as a server, is a critical tool.  few p2p\n&gt; apps could live without it.\nAgreed.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; * event mechanisms.  given a single unidirectional connection there is no\n&gt; way for a server to initiate an event, short of the knownow hack of\n&gt; running events along the backstream to the client.\nHey.. it&#39;s not a hack, its &#39;elegant&#39;...\n\n&gt;\n&gt; * coordinating related events on the two streams.  It is much easier to do\n&gt; this with a single connection than with two.  (Years ago I actually did\n&gt; write a coordinator for two connections, and it was a bear to get the\n&gt; details right.)\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve done enough preliminary hacking in Tomcat to know that I can munge\n&gt; the socket layer -- exclusively stuff below HTTP -- to support long\n&gt; lasting connections where both parties can act as a client, server or\n&gt; both.  But I am queasy about how this interacts with REST design.\n\nThis is an area I would love to work on - a networking layer that did a\npersistent, client-initiated connection and then consumed incoming messages\nand delivered them to a regular HTTP server (possibly via jserv sockets to\ntomcat or something) as an unsolicited incoming request.\nThis lets you write server-apps on clients/desktops - use all the tools you\nare familiar with - ASP, JSP, servlets, etc. With some COM events, you can\neven deliver to Win32 apps. The other pieces you need are public names\n(host/domain), an intermediary to do the message transfer/new-protocol, and\nsome sort of security.\nThis would &#39;break&#39; HTTP in that the messages between the client and the\nmessage server would not be visibly HTTP requests - but that&#39;s okay.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The new design would still work by resource modelling.  However it would\n&gt; not be oriented towards hypertext, so stuff related to connection keep\n&gt; alive would be hairy.  It would not work with existing proxies, but that&#39;s\n&gt; not a REST issue IMO.\nI don&#39;t think keep-alive is related to hypertext. I don&#39;t know why you see\nit as different than a persistent connection?\nThe handshaking is still request/response (except for\nchunked-transfer-encoding, but I wouldn&#39;t mess with that).\n\n&gt;\n&gt; On the other hand, the new design would be HTTP to the letter, because\n&gt; HTTP doesn&#39;t say anyting about the socket layer.\n&gt;\n&gt; ...thoughts?\nThis is what I was talking about a while ago with the asynch-http &\nhttp+events discussion. Can&#39;t find the links right now...\n\n\n\n"}}
