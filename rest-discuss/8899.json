XML is a poor serialization f=\r\normat, \n&gt; &gt; because it has little direct mapping to &#39;data&#39;.  It&#39;s great for=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; documents, but as programmmers, we deal with data, we design data (or=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; try).  Expecting programmers to design well thought out documents\nis =\r\ntoo \n&gt; &gt; much to ask, IMHO.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sounds like you live in a very tiny box, a=\r\nnd in which you never seen an \n&gt; non-record oriented data. In my world docu=\r\nments contain data and data \n&gt; includes documents. The distinction is fuzzy=\r\n to nonexistent.
