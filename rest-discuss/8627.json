Or at least bcomes a\n&gt; pale shadow of itself.\n&gt;\n\nWell, I&#39;m hoping to change that.  The /date service ought to be polished \nup this week, at which point I intend to release it open-source (by adding \na link to a .zip file to the service document).  I&#39;m jumping the gun a \ntouch here, but:\n\n[1] http://ericjbowman.com/date\n\nIs a language-negotiated resource (the 300 Multiple Choices functionality \nis the last bit, totally wrong atm), currently the service document is only \navailable in English but the &lt;form&gt; takes you to:\n\n[2] http://en.ericjbowman.com/date?iso=2000-01-01\n\nIf the negotiation point had served the date.de.html file instead of the \ndate.en.html file, the &lt;form&gt; would point to:\n\n[3] http://de.ericjbowman.com/date?iso=2000-01-01\n\nI have the same question as this thread, just what value if any would \nthere be for me to describe this service using WADL?  Speaking of content \nnegotiation, yes it certainly is one of the key features of REST, but \nunfortunately it is also the Achilles&#39; heel of HTTP, IMHO.\n\nWhich is why you can override the conneg watchdog on my system by \ndistracting it with a (representational) cookie.  ;-)\n\nOf course, the output at [3] is just an example, this is work-in-progress.  \nImplements HEAD, GET, PUT and DELETE.  You can check if any given year is \na leap year, by making a HEAD request for Feb. 29, the boolean response is \neither 200 OK or 400 Bad Request, 0004 AD - 4000 AD.\n\nWriteup, source code (and /state service) coming sometime in June.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
