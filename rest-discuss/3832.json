I didn&#39;t realize.  We should\nadd this to the FAQ, as we&#39;ve had this twice before I think.\n\nSometimes it&#39;s 400, sometimes it&#39;s 200.  It depends on the method too.\nFor PUT, I&#39;d use 400, because to return 200 would be telling\nintermediaries that what was sent, was stored.  For POST, more than\nlikely I&#39;d use 200, because I may want to resolve the bad data problem\nby, for example, driving the application to ask for the data again,\nand perhaps I want to count the retries or some such.  If I used 400,\nthen the application makes no progress, so I can&#39;t do that.  I think.\nFunny how such a seemingly simple question opens up the whole &quot;state&quot;\ncan-o-worms.\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
