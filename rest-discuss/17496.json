T=\r\nhat was already true with POST anyway. When you ask if something is legal p=\r\ner the spec, you don&#39;t get to add additional constraints on the design of s=\r\nolutions by requiring them to solve the problem a way you like. A good spec=\r\n should unambiguously define what is and isn&#39;t compliant. If somebody comes=\r\n along and implements a design that uses these verbs in a way nobody though=\r\nt of, the only question is whether you can find black letters in the text o=\r\nf the spec that you can circle in a red pen to defend the assertion that &quot;y=\r\nou didn&#39;t comply with this&quot;.\n\nLore is that PUT cannot be a partial update, =\r\nbut no one has answered my challenge to point to the text of the spec to su=\r\npport this lore.  Nothing in RFC 2616 backs up the contention that the serv=\r\ner must forget all previous state, in fact to the contrary, the spec says &quot;=\r\nHTTP/1.1 does not define how a PUT method affects the state of an origin se=\r\nrver&quot;. It&#39;s required to be idempotent and to support the vague notion that =\r\n&quot;the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI.&quot; To my readi=\r\nng, partial updates can satisfy all the constraints that are actually docum=\r\nented in the spec. \n\nIt very well may be that the community that produced H=\r\nTTP 1.1 did not have partial updates in mind when they wrote the spec. This=\r\n is irrelevant to the question of whether the text of the spec forbids it o=\r\nr not. \n\nAs to why not use PATCH, I don&#39;t object if others don&#39;t want use i=\r\nt. I choose not to for a variety of reasons, which can be summarized as it&#39;=\r\ns too exotic for me to expect of my clients. A client which supports only a=\r\n subset methods explicitly given by RFC 2616 will not understand PATCH, and=\r\n I believe this is true of most of my clients. I also think I can solve the=\r\n problem without it, by using POST, using PUT with refinements, or using PU=\r\nT with partial updates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
