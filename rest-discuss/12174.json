Fail=\r\nure here implies that out-of-band information  \n&gt; is driving\n&gt; &gt;&gt; interacti=\r\non instead of hypertext.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I have a few ideas, but no concrete exam=\r\nples of driving system-to- \n&gt; system\n&gt; &gt;&gt; data-oriented &quot;services&quot; through =\r\nin-band information.  That&#39;s  \n&gt; level of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; discoverability that I&#39;ve on=\r\nly heard about discussed in WS-*  \n&gt; systems, but\n&gt; &gt;&gt; have never seen in p=\r\nractice.  Web sites and other human consumable\n&gt; &gt;&gt; applications can fulfil=\r\nl this requirement because they have the  \n&gt; ultimate\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;discovery engin=\r\ne&quot; we know of as an implicit part of the  \n&gt; &quot;system,&quot; namely\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the huma=\r\nn brain (or human mind if you&#39;d like to be philosophical  \n&gt; about it).\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The system-to-system interaction that I know about generally  \n&gt; req=\r\nuire a some\n&gt; &gt;&gt; level of coupling that make discoverability a much more co=\r\nmplex  \n&gt; issue.  The\n&gt; &gt;&gt; techniques with which I am familiar almost seem =\r\ninadequate to the  \n&gt; task.  Roy\n&gt; &gt;&gt; recently said on rest-discuss:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; A lot of people think of systems as static things. Dead things.   \n&gt; RE=\r\nST is not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; going to appeal to those people. All of its constraints are =\r\n \n&gt; designed to keep\n&gt; &gt;&gt; systems living longer than we are willing or able=\r\n to anticipate.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Perhaps I&#39;m simply not familiar with the fitting =\r\ntechniques and  \n&gt; technologies\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to create more life-like systems.  Do =\r\nyou know of any APIs that  \n&gt; implements a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; few features and are used i=\r\nn system-to-system that fully embrace  \n&gt; the REST\n&gt; &gt;&gt; hypertext constrain=\r\nts?  Any insight would be greatly appreciated.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subbu Allamaraju rec=\r\nently published an article at InfoQ about\n&gt; &gt; describing REST based applica=\r\ntions that obey this constraint:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    http://www.infoq.com/articles/s=\r\nubbu-allamaraju-rest\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; which points out that, if you want to go whole=\r\n hog in this  \n&gt; direction,\n&gt; &gt; you stop describing the URI structure of yo=\r\nur application (like we  \n&gt; see\n&gt; &gt; in most REST API descriptions), and sta=\r\nrt talking about the &quot;rel&quot;\n&gt; &gt; (relationship) values that can be used to id=\r\nentify semantically\n&gt; &gt; interesting hyperlinks that the client might want t=\r\no follow.  His\n&gt; &gt; examples use a &lt;link&gt; element modeled after the way that=\r\n Atom and  \n&gt; HTML\n&gt; &gt; define it, which seems to be a popular trend for RES=\r\nT APIs that use\n&gt; &gt; XML.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; After a day of working with a colleague de=\r\nsigning some new REST  \n&gt; based\n&gt; &gt; APIs, I was musing about this while wat=\r\nching one of the video  \n&gt; blogs I\n&gt; &gt; enjoy (Hak5 from revision3.com), whe=\r\nre they have occasional stories\n&gt; &gt; about remotely controlled tanks that ca=\r\nn fire nerf missiles on\n&gt; &gt; command.  How to model the control of such a th=\r\ning with a REST API?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The basic CRUD type operations map pretty clea=\r\nnly.  Presumably, the\n&gt; &gt; well-known URI of the service will offer me a lin=\r\nk I can use for\n&gt; &gt; creating a new tank in the first place.  And, the repre=\r\nsentation I  \n&gt; get\n&gt; &gt; back can include a  &quot;self&quot; link so I can reference =\r\nit with a GET\n&gt; &gt; (retrieve an updated representation), a PUT (update prope=\r\nrties),  \n&gt; or a\n&gt; &gt; DELETE (remove this tank from my collection).  But how=\r\n does one  \n&gt; model\n&gt; &gt; actually firing the missile?  One idea that seems p=\r\nlausible is to\n&gt; &gt; include a link element with a &quot;fire&quot; relationship, and d=\r\nocument (in\n&gt; &gt; your API spec) that a POST to this URI will cause the missi=\r\nle to be\n&gt; &gt; launched.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    &lt;tank&gt;\n&gt; &gt;        &lt;name&gt;My First Tank&lt;/na=\r\nme&gt;\n&gt; &gt;        &lt;missile-state&gt;LOADED&lt;/missile-state&gt;\n&gt; &gt;        &lt;link rel=\r\n=3D&quot;self&quot; href=3D&quot;http://tanks-r-us.example.com/tanks/0123 \n&gt; &quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &gt;      =\r\n  &lt;!-- POST to this link to prime the spring or whatever\n&gt; &gt; actually launc=\r\nhes the missile --&gt;\n&gt; &gt;        &lt;link rel=3D&quot;ready&quot; href=3D&quot;http://tanks-r-u=\r\ns.example.com/...&quot;\n&gt; &gt; title=3D&quot;Ready Launcher&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &gt;        &lt;!-- POST to t=\r\nhis link to aim the launcher at the specified\n&gt; &gt; horizontal and vertical c=\r\noordinates --&gt;\n&gt; &gt;        &lt;link rel=3D&quot;aim&quot; href=3D&quot;http://tanks-r-us.examp=\r\nle/com/...&quot;\n&gt; &gt; title=3D&quot;Aim Tank&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &gt;        &lt;!-- POST to this link to f=\r\nire the missle --&gt;\n&gt; &gt;        &lt;link rel=3D&quot;fire&quot; href=3D&quot;http://tanks-r-us.=\r\nexample.com/...&quot;\n&gt; &gt; title=3D&quot;Fire Missile&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &gt;        ...\n&gt; &gt;    &lt;/tank&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Presumably, the &quot;fire&quot; link would only be presented by the server =\r\n \n&gt; when\n&gt; &gt; the tank was in a state where this operation makes sense (i.e.=\r\n a\n&gt; &gt; &quot;fire&quot; link is included only when the missile is currently LOADED).\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; But the server should be prepared to handle the case where a client\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n tried to fire the missile after someone else had already fired it,\n&gt; &gt; bec=\r\nause they had retrieved their representation earlier.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A POST makes =\r\nthe most sense, because firing the missile is  \n&gt; definitely\n&gt; &gt; not idempo=\r\ntent :-).  Among other things, it will have side effects\n&gt; &gt; that change th=\r\ne missile-state of my tank (probably first to FIRING,\n&gt; &gt; then to EMPTY) wh=\r\nich I can monitor by doing polled GETs, or being\n&gt; &gt; notified by some out-o=\r\nf-band event mechanism.  And the usual  \n&gt; semantics\n&gt; &gt; for error response=\r\ns seem to fit pretty well, too:\n&gt; &gt; * 202 -- if it takes a non-trivial amou=\r\nnt of time to fire the  \n&gt; missile,\n&gt; &gt; the server might accept the request=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;  and return a URI to monitor for completion\n&gt; &gt; * 401 -- who the heck =\r\nare you\n&gt; &gt; * 403 -- sorry , you&#39;re not allowed to fire my missile\n&gt; &gt; * 40=\r\n9 -- nobody can fire a missile when the launcher is empty  \n&gt; (presumably\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;  someone else beat you to the punch, so your reference to this URI  \n&gt; i=\r\ns stale)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In the particular use case of firing, there isn&#39;t much nee=\r\nd for a\n&gt; &gt; request entity (although, if a tank had more than one missile\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; launcher, you might model things by including a field in the request\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n entity to select which launcher to fire).  But, in principle, you\n&gt; &gt; coul=\r\nd include an encapsulation of whatever information is needed for\n&gt; &gt; the se=\r\nrver to do what you want it to do.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Earlier threads have discussed f=\r\niring off (possibly transactional)\n&gt; &gt; business logic.
