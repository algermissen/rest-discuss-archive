Alexander Jacobson wrote:\n&gt; In this world, the XSLT developer should be\n&gt; completely ignorant of server architecture,\n&gt; depending entirely on the content of the generated\n&gt; XML to construct HTML pages.  In particular, the\n&gt; XML should supply both href and action attribute\n&gt; values.  It should also supply the information for\n&gt; the XSLT developer to construct HTML forms to\n&gt; query/post to those action resources.\n&gt; \n&gt; The problem is we need to choose a way to present\n&gt; that information.  My suggestion is to use relaxNG\n&gt; in the following manner:\n&gt; \n&gt;  &lt;form action=&quot;url&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot; src=&quot;schema.rng&quot;/&gt;\n\nUsing a canonical serialization for an RDF Form in XML, I think that\nthis could quite easily be done.  The &quot;action&quot; URI is the URI of\neither the resource of type Container or type Indexable.  And if the\nformer, it&#39;s a POST form, if the latter, a GET form.  I don&#39;t see what\nrole any schema language may play there; send the RDF with an embedded\nRDF form, attach the style sheet, and it&#39;ll get converted to an HTML\nform on the client.\n\n&gt; An issue w/ using an XML specification language\n&gt; here is that you need to use javascript to get\n&gt; browsers to POST XML and perhaps you don&#39;t want to\n&gt; pass XML in query strings.  The question is\n&gt; whether these issues loom so large that it is\n&gt; worth the complexity of Yet Another Forms\n&gt; Spefication System (RDF-Forms, WIDL, X-Forms,\n&gt; etc).\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d rather just have the server automatically\n&gt; interpret a name/value posting as\n&gt; &lt;POST&gt;&lt;name&gt;value&lt;/name&gt;&lt;name2&gt;value&lt;/name&gt;&lt;/POST&gt;\n&gt; etc.  And have the schema/dtd specify which\n&gt; names are valid in what combination and number.\n&gt; Or use javascript on the client to do better.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thoughts?\n\nFWIW, I wasn&#39;t considering browsers at all when I designed RDF Forms.\nI was focused entirely on application-to-application integration.\nBut I don&#39;t see the problem with XSLTing between RDF Forms and HTML\nforms.  You could also do it with XForms I reckon, but I like my XML to\nbe RDF/XML where possible.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.   Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA.        http://www.markbaker.ca\n\n"}}
