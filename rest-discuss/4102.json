Users without an account sh=\r\nouldn&#39;t \nbe asked for their password unless they do something to indicate t=\r\nhey \nhave one.  A page with options for  ((1) logging in (2) recovering \npa=\r\nssword (3) creating an account) matches user expectations, a \nchallenge dia=\r\nlog with an option for entering your valid password \ndoesn&#39;t.  I don&#39;t mean=\r\n it matches expectations because it&#39;s the \nstandard, although that&#39;s the tr=\r\nuth.  I mean that it matches \nexpectations because it matches the reality o=\r\nf a user&#39;s potential \nstates.\n\nAnother reason is that challenge-response is=\r\n fixed in the hierarchy of \na web site.  You can&#39;t hit the challenge at /ac=\r\ncount and have the info \nstill visible at /history.  However, with cookies =\r\nyou can login at \n/account and still have the authentication info visible a=\r\nt /history.  \nThis is a common application requirement -- a web app frequen=\r\ntly needs \nto handle a request differently depending on whether the user is=\r\n logged \nin or whether the login account has write privs.\n\n- Lucas\n\n\n"}}
