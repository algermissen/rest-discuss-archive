Is there \nanyone who has used REST(/Atom/RDF/XML/?) more like a backend for \nobject-mapping *on the client*, so that the client uses Java objects and \nthe changes are persisted using REST principles.\n\nI&#39;m looking for patterns on how to map resources, do collections, send \nchanges (as commands or state), handle security, do domain rules on the \nclient, etc.\n\n/Rickard\n\n"}}
