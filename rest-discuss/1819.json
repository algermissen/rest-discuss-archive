So yes,\n&gt; &gt; you do need a TURN/ETRN and it won&#39;t be backwards compatible. My\n&gt; &gt; instinct is to have the client open a socket and ask for a backchannel\n&gt; &gt; with a POST. The server creates a &quot;listener&quot; and returns the port number\n&gt; &gt; and maybe some authentication data. The client connects *not* using HTTP\n&gt; &gt; but using a &quot;reversible socket protocol&quot;. The client and server\n&gt; &gt; understand that on the reversed socket they have swapped roles.\n&gt; \n&gt; No doubt.  but what is the reversible socket protocol?  The most\n&gt; parsimonious solution to my mind is that it&#39;s 100% HTTP 1.1, except that\n&gt; the transport layer underneath is different.  Is there any architectural\n&gt; reason why this wouldn&#39;t work?\n\nRight, my point was that the reversible TCP protocol would be a thin\ntransport layer that just reverses a TCP connection. When you use an\napplication protocol on top of a reverse TCP connection, whoever\ninitiated the TCP connection behaves as if they had received it and vice\nversa.\n\n&gt; A total digression: the fundamental problem with p2p is that the network\n&gt; is self-organizing in a way that affects your moment to moment\n&gt; interactions.  With browser-oriented applications the self-organizing\n&gt; macro structure is too big to be visible usually.\n\nThat&#39;s true but I don&#39;t see it as particularly a problem that causes\nissues for REST.\n\n&gt;....\n&gt; It&#39;s incompatible in a wierd way.  99.99% of the thought that went into\n&gt; HTTP can be reused.  All HTTP implementations need a little bit of hacking\n&gt; to be compatible.  All HTTP-based applications need a total rewrite.  The\n&gt; loss is that it&#39;s a new protocol, the win is that the new protocol is also\n&gt; HTTP.  ...that&#39;s the idea anyway.\n\nI&#39;m not sure about this rewrite stuff. For Morpheus ran an HTTP server\non each client to share files. You could browse someone else&#39;s share\njust with a browser. Clueless media people treated this as a &quot;security\nhole.&quot;\n\n *\nhttp://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=27368&cid=0&pid=0&startat=&threshold=5&mode=flat&commentsort=0&op=Change\n\n-- \nCome discuss XML and REST web services at:\n  Open Source Conference: July 22-26, 2002, conferences.oreillynet.com\n  Extreme Markup: Aug 4-9, 2002,  www.extrememarkup.com/extreme/\n\n"}}
