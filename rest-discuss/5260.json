Abusing HTTP to serve as a transport \nprotocol is one of the things that can lead to people not taking \nadvantage of the RESTful nature of HTTP.\n\nHTTP is not the only possible RESTful application protocol, indeed if we \nwere starting from scratch we could probably do better. However it&#39;s \ndevelopment did go hand in hand with that of the REST style, \nparticularly the changes that led to HTTP1.1 being developped as a \nsuccessor to HTTP1.0.\n\nHence when we are talking about REST we are most often talking about \nHTTP as the application protocol (with TCP/IP or perhaps a secure \ntransport protocol built on top of TCP/IP as the transport protocol) but \nthis is not necessarily the case.\n\n"}}
