Then move to message \nN+1. When message N is successfully PUT, the representation returned should \ncontain the number N+1 and the URL for its PUT, and this resource should be \nseparately GET&#39;able. The client can drop retention of any message numbered N or \nless.\n\nIf you want to get fancy, you could allow batch PUT of records N+1 to M in one \nmessage representation, with the understanding the server will discover and \nenforce within-message ordering or records. This is just a go fast technique.\n\nThis works, but is it really RESTful? The client&#39;s understanding of things like \nmessage order is a form of application state that isn&#39;t really hypermedia \ndriven. You are really trying to create an event driven architecture that uses \nHTTP as a transport. Which is fine, sometimes you have that problem. But I think \nRoy made the point to me in a different thread that we should acknowledge that \nevent driven architectural styles are different that RESTful ones.\n\n\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Sean Kennedy &lt;seandkennedy@...&gt;\nTo: Rest Discussion Group &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tue, July 13, 2010 3:51:07 AM\nSubject: [rest-discuss] HTTP reliability - in order msg delivery?\n\n  \nHi,\n    I am re-reading Stefans article [1] and am looking at msg reliability. I \nlike Joe Gregorios best practice [2] as it leverages PUT&#39;s idempotence. I am not \n\naware of any approach that supports in-order delivery of a sequence of HTTP \nmessages...\n\nWhat if you needed in-order message delivery? I imagine for a banking \napplication, the order of transactions on an account would be important...\n\nRegards,\nSean.\n\n[1] http://www.infoq. com/articles/ tilkov-rest- doubts\n[2] http://bitworking. org/news/ 201/RESTify- DayTrader  \n\n\n      \n\n"}}
