The \n&gt; &gt; second is a query.  Specifically, over the parts &quot;space&quot; \n&gt; &gt; matching the criteria part-id=00345.  While these two \n&gt; &gt; examples might refer to the same resource, they are different things.\n&gt; Not true. Both are resource identifiers. They are not different things. \n&gt; The representation returned is independent of how the URI is formated.\n&gt; Whether a representation is a list of results is immaterial - client apps\n&gt; should learn about that via the context of the URI and/or\n&gt; content-negotiation.\n\nYes, thanks.  A resource identified by &quot;/parts?part-id=00345&quot; and a\nquery-result identified by &quot;/queries/saved/named/foo&quot; are both, equally,\nresource identifiers... the type (and context, as you say) of the\nreturned representation is probably what matters more in the processing.\n\nBut -- as URIs -- they are different in structure, not just in\nformatting.  Specifically w.r.t. how relative references are resolved\nand the hierarchy (or not) of the resource being identified.\n\n...jsled\n-- \nhttp://asynchronous.org/ - `a=jsled; b=asynchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b}`\n\n"}}
