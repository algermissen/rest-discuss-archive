The use of POST follows naturally, because what =\r\nelse would you use? A client is free to try a PUT and will find out at run =\r\ntime whether that works.\n\n\n&gt; POST does not have any \n&gt; semantics other than=\r\n doing something non-safe non-idempotent. while \n&gt; create fits that pattern=\r\n, it&#39;s much more specific and not something that \n&gt; is in any way defined b=\r\ny HTTP itself.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; All you need to know is that some resource has collec=\r\ntion semantics, so you should tell the client that /photos is a collection =\r\nrather than focussing on the action.\n&gt; \n&gt; you&#39;re assuming that by exposing =\r\ncollection semantics this inherently \n&gt; means you can POST to create. again=\r\n, that&#39;s not something that HTTP \n&gt; tells you. for example, AtomPub says th=\r\nat in order to create, you have \n&gt; to POST to an &quot;edit&quot; link, and not just =\r\nto the collection itself.\n\nHuh? Seems you are mixing editing with creating =\r\nentries, or?\n\nThat aside, the interaction descriptions the AtomPub spec giv=\r\nes, are an over specification, because the server is free to do what it wan=\r\nts and the client has to be able to deal with that. Constraining the method=\r\ns to use is a kind of coupling you cannot have (in a REStful system).\n\nIt i=\r\ns interesting that people usually seem to think specification of the method=\r\n to use is necessary to implement clients and servers, but when you think a=\r\nbout it, the choices are so limited that a developers knows the method to u=\r\nse anyhow.\n\nHints are good, but hey are just that, hints.\n\n&gt; you \n&gt; could d=\r\nefine a media type where the rule would be that you can always \n&gt; POST to a=\r\n collection&#39;s URI to create a new resource, but that would be \n&gt; semantics =\r\ndefined by that media type, and not by HTTP itself.\n\nYes you could, but IMH=\r\nO it&#39;s YAGNI and from a @RESTPOLICE POV, forbidden :-)\n\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; cheers,=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; dret.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; erik wilde | mailto:dret@... - tel:+1-510-2=\r\n061079 |\n&gt; | UC Berkeley - School of Information (ISchool) |\n&gt; | http://dre=\r\nt.net/netdret http://twitter.com/dret |\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
