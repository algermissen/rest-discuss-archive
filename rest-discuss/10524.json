Is there\n&gt; documented use of this?\n&gt; \n\nDoes there have to be?  Both OPTIONS and 300 Multiple Choices are\nunderspecified, which I just love because it gives more room to\nmaneuver.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; As for server capabilities, thats one of the things WADL could solve,\n&gt; as it can document for each resource the content-types being\n&gt; accepted. Another way would be to use rfc2295 but sadly its stayed at\n&gt; the experimental level.\n&gt;\n\nI&#39;m far from sold on the notion of service documents.  Interesting that\nyou should bring up RFC 2295, I was looking at this earlier:\n\n[1] http://gewis.win.tue.nl/~koen/conneg/draft-ietf-http-alternates-00.html\n\nLet&#39;s just say I&#39;m not as sad as you are over not having the alternates \nheader... ;-)\n\n&gt; \n&gt; That said, a GET request on a resource with multiple representation\n&gt; could carry a specific format for the payload of the 300 to contain\n&gt; content that can be supported by a user-agent. SO if you request\n&gt; application/html+xml, you&#39;re probably not an automated agent, but\n&gt; that doesnt prevent you from reading the alternate represetnations in\n&gt; head. Same goes with atom.\n&gt; \n\nActually, the OPTIONS method allows content negotiation, out-of-band \nin relation to GET for the same URI.  My example document uses XHTML \n1.1, now that I&#39;ve looked a little at FormFaces and DENG it seems \nthat XHTML 1.0 is the way to go.  The response to OPTIONS requests \nwould negotiate based on XForms support being detected, which would \nyield &#39;application/xhtml+xml&#39;, or not detected, which would yield \n&#39;text/html&#39; with the same document.  On GET and HEAD, the algorithm \nI&#39;m using is completely different and toggles between XHTML 1.1 and \nHTML 4.01 in addition to Content-Type.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
