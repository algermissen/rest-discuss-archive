I&#39;ve read a lot of general design axioms\n&gt; around this problem, but I haven&#39;t seen a lot of specific discussion of\n&gt; addressable resources where the data for the resource is, at the lowest\n&gt; level, the result of an SQL query.  My question is around the pros and cons\n&gt; of using query parameters vs. hard-coded URI segments.\n&gt;\n&gt; Say we have a database of movies and are looking for The Godfather.\n&gt;  Certainly something like www.movies.com/movies/dramas/Godfather,The may\n&gt; uniquely identify the target resource and be more readable, but is this\n&gt; better than something more dynamic like\n&gt; www.movies.com/movies?genre=dramas&title=Godfather,The ?\n&gt;\n&gt; It seems like the former forces the server to understand the hard-coded\n&gt; semantics of each URI segment and seems more limiting in that regard,\n&gt; whereas the latter seems to be a more flexible addressing mechanism, yet\n&gt; most examples of RESTful URI definitions I&#39;ve seen seem to prefer the\n&gt; former.  I&#39;d love to hear anyone&#39;s observations about the trade-offs and how\n&gt; I might be missing some considerations in approaching this problem?\n\nI don&#39;t think one is necessarily more flexible than the other since\nmost servers will allow you to easily dispatch off of any of the\ninformation with wildcards in the URI itself.\n\nI&#39;m actually surprised at the more or less indifferent responses so\nfar since I&#39;ve assumed the former is better all along.  The only\njustification I can think of right now is that the former &quot;looks&quot; more\nlike a static resource to me whereas the latter seems like a poorly\nnamed parameterized function.  Maybe this is more style and subject\nthan I thought.\n\n--tim\n\n"}}
