If this were actively\n&gt; happening, on a wide scale, it&#39;s hard to imagine any new media types\n&gt; being created, even new types with full registration and\n&gt; standardization. That information would have to percolate through all\n&gt; of the configurations of all the systems denying the up to now unknown\n&gt; data type so they could properly pass it through.\n&gt; \n\nThat isn&#39;t the problem.  The problem with a library-based API is just\nwhat Roy says it is in his thesis:  &quot;Why is this important?  Because it\ndifferentiates a system where network intermediaries can be effective\nagents from a system where they can be, at most, routers.&quot;  If all any\nparticipant can ever at most do is route your payload, you&#39;re missing\nout on the benefits of a uniform interface, particularly anarchic\nscalability and serendipitous re-use, which come about when systems\nyou&#39;ve never even heard of are acting as effective agents, which only\noccurs with ubiquitous identifiers (and even then, isn&#39;t guaranteed).\n\nI&#39;ve configured more than one Web cache in my day, and what I do is\nrestrict it to a limited number of types which are ubiquitous enough to\nmatter.  I&#39;m not alone in this behavior.  Why *should* I cache\napplication/foo+xml if it&#39;s undefined?  What benefit is in it for me,\nas the owner of a cache, if it&#39;s an insignificant percentage of traffic?\nWhy should I let any undefined payload take up cache resources, at the\nexpense of something that&#39;s a million times more likely to be re-used?\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
