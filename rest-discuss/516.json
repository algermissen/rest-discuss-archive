The following are only\n&gt; those responses that seem solid:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Okay, of course expiration counts should go both ways. The client should\n&gt; &gt; request one and the server should say what it decided upon.\n&gt; \n&gt; Short of having a bid/counterbid/countercounterbid process, which is too hard to\n&gt; implement, my suggestion was that we just have\n&gt; bid/reject/bid-1/reject/bid-N/accept.\n\nI don&#39;t see the benefit of bidding and counter-bidding. It isn&#39;t\nhaggling. The subscriber should say what it wants. The publisher is\nboss. It should say what it offers. That&#39;s it. The question in my mind\nis whether the publisher should throw an error when the client asks for\ntoo much or whether it should just say: &quot;The best I could do is X. If\nyou want to delete the subscription, go ahead.&quot;\n\n&gt; &gt; &quot;The message MAY contain a header called &quot;Requested-Expiration&quot;.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry, no.  I have reloaded the page several times and it still says MUST.\n\nThere are two different relevant parts:\n\n&gt; The message MAY contain a header called &quot;Requested-Expiration&quot;. \n\n&gt; The response to the Subscription MUST include a header called &quot;Subscription-Expiration&quot;. \n\nThe spec is still working on the &quot;you tell me what I want I&#39;ll tell you\nwhat I decided&quot; model.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; Standards are not a goal in themselves, and I am not convinced that\n&gt; canonicalization is constructive at this early stage.  \n\nStandards are not the end-goal but clients and servers (subscribers and\npublishers) that work together without negotiation is a goal and it\ntakes standards. Even if only six people ever make software that works\ntogether and we are all on this list, the point is that we can only make\nsoftware that works together with standards.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; Specification is always destructive in that it reduces the available range of\n&gt; expression.  Overspecifying is not a service.\n\nYou&#39;re going meta on me. I left a lot of freedom to the implementation:\n\n&gt; &gt; &quot;The client MAY renew\n&gt; &gt; the subscription before this time. If it does not, the server MAY stop\n&gt; &gt; sending notifications after that time. The server MAY also remove the\n&gt; &gt; Subscription URI.&quot;  This behavior should be left to the implementation.\n\nAll that is standardized is that the server is &quot;within its rights&quot; to\nstop delivering notifications to the client and forget about it after\nthe expiry time. The point is the server shouldn&#39;t just decide to stop\ndelivering notifications whenever it feels like. It made a commitment.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; hmm....   a relative date?  a compound expression?  need to mull this over.  I\n&gt; would prefer to avoid this kind of negotiation, which leads inevitably to yet\n&gt; another programming language.\n\nI understand, but you wedged the door a little bit by going beyond my\npurely temporal expirations. The nice thing about temporal expirations\nis that you know how long you have to renew. \n\n&gt;...\n&gt; For the most part it&#39;s not important.  Servers currently return 404 whenever it\n&gt; pleases them.  For the same reasons watches should be assumed to go until they\n&gt; stop.\n\nHow will you even know that&#39;s happened? I think that the server should\nmake a commitment.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
