The server occasionally gets duplicate \n&gt; requests from clients, which, since these requests are not idempotent, \n&gt; causes problems. I hypothesize that the double-requests are occuring \n&gt; when the server gets busy, and doesn&#39;t respond to a request within a \n&gt; certain time frame, so the client (sometimes IE, sometimes our own \n&gt; software) decides to resend the request. The two get queued up and \n&gt; handled one right after each other by the server.\n&gt; \n&gt; I want to change the state-effecting operations to use POST, but to \n&gt; justify the change in the software, I&#39;m seeking evidence that using POST \n&gt; might resolve this problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; Are web browsers prone to automatically resending GET requests, if they \n&gt; don&#39;t hear back from the server within, say 5 seconds?  Or 30 seconds?  \n&gt; Will the same thing happen with a POST?  Thanks.\n\nGET being idempotent could be part of this - GET promises to be safe for \nsuch retries, and if your product isn&#39;t safe for these requests then \nthat&#39;s a bug. However repeated POSTs could still happen. So as well as \nmoving to POST* (which you should still do) you may wish to have some \nsort of timestamp, sequence number or entity identifier in the data POSTed.\n\n*Assuming that POST is the correct verb to use, and there isn&#39;t some \nother factor in what you&#39;re doing, though I doubt it&#39;s something where \nPUT or DELETE would be appropriate from what you say about it - though \ncould it be somewhere where PUT along with If-Not-Modified would be \nappropriate?\n\n"}}
