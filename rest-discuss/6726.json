PUT does not selectively replace the\nrepresentations that happen to match a given language header field.\nNegotiated resources either disallow PUT or redirect to the\nmore appropriate (localized) resource that corresponds to the\nlanguage-specific variant.\n\nIn other words, resources don&#39;t have translations. Each resource has\na given meaning.  When that meaning includes content negotiation, remote\nauthoring has to be managed as a set of subsidiary/specific resources\nthat indirectly change the set of variant representations of the\nnegotiated resource.  Authoring whole sets through a single resource\nis not supported by the protocol because it is more efficient to have\nthe server provide individual identifiers for the members of the\ncurrent set and also more likely that such identifiers will help\nthe author retain the sameness of the resource across edits.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
