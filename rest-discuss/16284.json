It\ntends to reduce the serendipity that normally occurs with rest.\n\nThe thin representations in a thin/fat pair tend to be narrowly focus\non some particular use case.  Usually multiple uses will emerge that\ncould almost, but not quite, use the thin representation because it is\na little too thin.  These use cannot all be accommodated ore the thin\nrepresentation would become too &quot;fat&quot;.\n\nHaving a multiple representation types also raises the cognitive\neffort required implement a client of the system.  Client implementers\nmust understand both representations and decide which to use.  It also\nelevates the risk that a client implementer will decide your system is\nunsuitable because they do not understand that a more complete\nrepresentation is available, since that information is only available\nout-of-band (ie, in the documentation which they might not bother to\nread).\n\nIn my experience it is best to avoid the thin/fat representation\napproach and just have a single representation that has all the\nrelevant information.  If that representation is very large it is\noften a good indication that one or more additional resources would\nuseful for some of the information.  The original representation can\nthen link to the resource(s) that contain the additional information.\n\nSo in your example, i would probably not embed the address in the user\nand stick with a link to the address resource.\n\nPeter\n&lt;http://barelyenough.org&gt;\n\n"}}
