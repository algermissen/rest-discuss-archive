So? I&#39;m a little confused. Should I just say\n&gt; that this part of my application doesn&#39;t fit the REST assumptions, so\n&gt; it doesn&#39;t even make sense talking about it? Or does it make sense to\n&gt; consider it under a different light?\n&gt; \n\nIt fits in just fine.  POST your draft to the real URL for your\ndocument instead of using PUT.  Clean up the submitted HTML in whatever\nway the server would if the method were PUT.  You can return the result\nat the real URL for your document, but with &#39;.draft&#39; appended, or\n&#39;/draft&#39;, whatever floats your boat.  Nothing like RPC.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
