This one loads in\n&gt; a browser and displays similar to HTML (just becau=\r\nse I wanted this\n&gt; prototype to be viewable in a browser). Doing a &quot;view so=\r\nurce&quot; on that\n&gt; URL will show you the raw markup. I have a few more example=\r\ns based on\n&gt; this proto-media-type, but haven&#39;t published them.\n&gt;\n&gt; That pr=\r\nototype uses elements based on my Hypermedia Factors[2].\n&gt;\n&gt; I also publish=\r\ned a blog post on designing hypermedia types that\n&gt; contains a sample machi=\r\nne-oriented media type example[3]. This is\n&gt; actually an early version of a=\r\n machine-oriented declarative markup\n&gt; that I&#39;ve not yet published. I think=\r\n there are a few minor things to\n&gt; change and this could be a clean machine=\r\n-readable media-type for a\n&gt; wide range of uses. While the example there is=\r\n expressed in XML, the\n&gt; general rules used in that example could easily be=\r\n translated into\n&gt; other data formats including JSON.\n&gt;\n&gt; I will also menti=\r\non that Mike Kelly has published an example of a\n&gt; machine-readable media-t=\r\nype (Hal) that is worth reviewing.\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] http://amundsen.com/hypermedia/e=\r\nxamples/doc.xml\n&gt; [2] http://amundsen.com/hypermedia/hfactor/\n&gt; [3] http://=\r\namundsen.com/blog/archives/1041\n&gt; [4] http://restafari.blogspot.com/2010/06=\r\n/please-accept-applicationhalxml.html\n&gt;\n&gt; mca\n&gt; http://amundsen.com/blog/\n&gt;=\r\n http://mamund.com/foaf.rdf#me\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Tue, Jul 20, 2010 at 12:37, Pet=\r\ner &lt;pkeane@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, &quot;Eric J.
