Their  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; purpose is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; discovered by inspection.  Of course, there are expectations when\n&gt;&gt;&gt; following a link and breaking these may cause confusion in the user\n&gt;&gt;&gt; agent even for humnas (for example, following a &quot;pay now&quot; link and\n&gt;&gt;&gt; arriving at a recipe for chocolate cake).  Furthermore, encoding the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nature of the document in the content type, means that this\n&gt;&gt;&gt; information will be out-of-band, which may cause other  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; complications.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; That is a misinterpretation.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sorry, but can you clarify if you simply don&#39;t agree with my  \n&gt; interpretation or if you *know* that my interpretation is wrong?\n\nSee RFC 2616#7.1 and 14.17. Entity headers like Content-Type provide  \nmetadata about the entity. What a given media type means is something  \nclients and servers learn out of band. This is true for existing IANA  \nmedia types as well as new media types.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The idea behind using concrete media types is to keep the  \n&gt;&gt; interactions visible, i.e., we should be able to apply some amount  \n&gt;&gt; of processing without parsing the representation. That processing  \n&gt;&gt; could be in the form of routing at a proxy, prioritizing/ \n&gt;&gt; deprioritizing some messages, or applying different caching rules.\n&gt;\n&gt; That can also be achieved by adding custom HTTP headers or known end- \n&gt; points.  Since we&#39;re already talking about custom MIME types, I  \n&gt; don&#39;t these alternatives as fundamentally different.  Either way,  \n&gt; the proxy/gateway knows about the application&#39;s intent, which means  \n&gt; they are coupled.  Though headers would be more generic (or neutral  \n&gt; in Nick-speak).\n\nSame as above.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The moment you start overloading media types, that visibility would  \n&gt;&gt; be gone. Also note that this is a problem with any payload format,  \n&gt;&gt; including Atom.\n&gt;\n&gt; Would the web really have scaled as well as it did if we had &quot;text/ \n&gt; login+html&quot;, &quot;text/checkout+html&quot; instead of only &quot;text/html&quot;?  What  \n&gt; if a page allows both operations, does it become &quot;text/login+checkout \n&gt; +html&quot;?  I&#39;m a bit wary about manifesting the intent at that level.\n\nThe answer is simple. Are clients required to apply special processing  \nrules to any of these?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If visibility is of no importance for your applications, fine, use  \n&gt;&gt; HTML/XHTML, POX, Atom or whatever. If visibility is important, look  \n&gt;&gt; for or design concrete media types.\n&gt;\n&gt; Some concrete examples when to use one over the other could be  \n&gt; helpful.  What kind of documents/applications require specialized  \n&gt; MIME types?  For instance, my above &quot;text/login+html&quot; types are  \n&gt; probably not what you had in mind.\n\n\nIMO, there is no binary answer to the question of whether you should  \nalways use some well-known media type or not. Either approach could  \nbite back if not well-thought out. There were instances where some  \nformat-designers &quot;forgot&quot; to assign media types and created mess.  \nApart from visibility, consider interoperability and compatibility.\n\nSubbu\n--\nhttp://subbu.org\n\n\n"}}
