Message queues are a common integration\ntechnique for non-REST architectures.  To claim that either one\nis a component of &quot;Pragmatic REST&quot; is the equivalent of putting\na giant Red Dunce Hat on your head and then parading around as\nif it were the latest fashion statement.\n\nThe idea that the community would welcome such a pack of\nmarketing morons as the standards-bearers of REST is simply\nridiculous.  Just close the stupid site down.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nRoy T.
