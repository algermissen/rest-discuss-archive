Don&#39;t confuse translation with localization (l10N).\n\n2. If you have a page resource which has had it&#39;s UI elements\nlocalized, for example a data entry form, then you are looking at one\nresource with multiple language-specific representation that you can\nconneg to.\n\n3. l10N conneg can be either language-driven from the Accept-Language\nheader and/or country-driven from the Request IP address. Both are\nvalid localizations and both can be used in concert. For example, the\nprice of goods and services are country-specific localizations not\nlanguage-specific (both in terms of the currency used and the tax\nregime to be applied).\n\n4. If you are looking at translations, then you have different\nresources. For example, Tolstoy wrote in Russian. If I don&#39;t speak\nRussian or read Cyrillic, then I should have a &quot;Read the English\ntranslation link&quot; I can click. Notice that the UI elements within\nwhich the Tolstoy text appears can still be localized (so I see the\navailable translations listed in a language I can understand).\n\n5. With the health warning that URI structure is orthogonal to REST,\nand whilst the URI is opaque architecturally nonetheless\nhuman-readable URIs are good; this is my personal preference for URI\nstructure:\n\nexample.com/localized-resource     =&gt; the resource URI (no representation)\nexample.com/localized-resource.en | .en-gb  | .fr | .de     =&gt; the\nlanguage conneg URI (no representation)\nexample.com/localized-resource.en-gb.html | .fr.html     =&gt; the\nlocalized html representation\n\nif there is an IP-driven country-specific localization:\n\nexample.co.uk/localized-resource.en-gb.html | .fr.html     =&gt; the\nlocalized html representation for the UK\n\nwhen it comes to translations, use the same structure as above except\nthat each translation will have a different name, e.g.\n\nexample.co.uk/tolstoy-in-russian.en-gb.html | .fr.html     =&gt; the\nlocalized html representation for the UK but with Russian content\nexample.co.uk/tolstoy-in-english.en-gb.html | .fr.html     =&gt; the\nlocalized html representation for the UK but with the english content\ntranslation shown\n\nNote to self - I should blog this.\n\nRegards,\nAlan Dean\nhttp://twitter.com/adean\n\nOn Sun, Jan 11, 2009 at 8:34 AM, Subbu Allamaraju &lt;subbu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On Jan 10, 2009, at 5:04 PM, Aristotle Pagaltzis wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; All of your charges are valid insofar as my argument wasn&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; particularly solidly constructed, but I stand by my overall\n&gt;&gt; thrust that language conneg as per RFC 2616 is a complicated but\n&gt;&gt; insufficient solution to a non-problem that is actually a feature\n&gt;&gt; with many advantages.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is actually the other way around. Changing the language in a UA is\n&gt; the inconvenient part, and it is likely because users don&#39;t change\n&gt; their language selection at the OS or UA level often. Language\n&gt; negotiation itself is not the complicated part.\n&gt;\n&gt; To answer the original question, the solution really depends on the\n&gt; client-side usage. If the clients are machines, and are capable of\n&gt; negotiation, I would stick with language negotiation. If, on the other\n&gt; hand, the application is user-facing, and users are required to switch\n&gt; between languages often for this specific application (for whatever\n&gt; reasons), then provide links to switch between languages.\n&gt;\n&gt; Subbu\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
