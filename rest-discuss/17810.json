This is what I tried to send:\n\n&gt; The only th=\r\ning I read was that figuring out which links \n&gt; to expose (from an authoriz=\r\nation viewpoint) is difficult to do. Which I \n&gt; don&#39;t happen to agree with.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; But it seems to be conventional wisdom to do this, so I&#39;m trying to f=\r\nind \n&gt; out why.\n\nThe reason for supplying links, is that the server tells t=\r\nhe client where to go next instead of hardwiring the expected URL into the =\r\nclient. It can be for authorization reasons but it need not be.\n\nExample: Y=\r\nou do a GET on a URL and fetch a blog entry. Now you want to post a comment=\r\n to that blog entry. Where do you do that? You could hardwire the &quot;Post com=\r\nments here&quot;-URL (template) into the client - or you could let the client lo=\r\nok for links attributed with &quot;Post comments here&quot;. In this way the server i=\r\ns free to change its URLs depending on its own needs and without reconfigur=\r\ning the clients.\n\n/J=F8rn\n\n\n\n"}}
