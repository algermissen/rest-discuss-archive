In the case of\nMOVE and COPY (words so closely t=\r\nied in most brians to file-type\nactions), it&#39;s easy to forget this aspect o=\r\nf the REST architectural\nmodel.\n\nAlso, his view that *state* is what is tra=\r\nnsferred (not file-objects,\nor documents, etc.) is essential to so much of =\r\nwhat makes REST\nwell-fitted for heterogeneous networks. Therefore, the idea=\r\n that we\ncan define a payload that contains instructions to a server on wha=\r\nt\nactions to take (&quot;Server-A, this is client-B calling. Please delete\nthe f=\r\nollowing items from the collection&quot;) runs counter to the notion\nof &quot;state t=\r\nransfer.&quot; I think this is a primary reason that folks\ntrying to understand =\r\nREST get tied up a bit when grappling with things\nsuch as BATCH and other c=\r\nollection-based actions. There is an\nadditional abstraction (the resource i=\r\ntself) that is not always easy\nto notice.\n\nFieldings approach (outlined in =\r\nhis quote below) is all about GET-ting\nthe state of the two locations (sour=\r\nce and destination), having the\nclient manipulate that state and send it ba=\r\nck to the server for\nprocessing. I see this as the client telling the serve=\r\nr: &quot;Ok, I see\nthe state of the collection as it exists right now. Please ma=\r\nke the\nstate of that collection match what I am sending you.&quot;\n\nAnother big =\r\nissue (not mentioned below) is access rights. To make a\nMOVE/COPY truly uni=\r\nform, it should work across servers. (MOVE this\nresource from server-a/coll=\r\nection to server-b/collection, etc.). And\nREST aside, HTTP itself does poor=\r\nly when dealing with access semantics\nfor cross-server activity (there is c=\r\nurrently only one &quot;Authorization&quot;\nheader).\n\nBut think I see the frame of th=\r\ne solution: design a way to express the\nstate of a collection along with a =\r\nway to express the modification of\nthat state such that a server can proper=\r\nly interpret the changes and\ngo about making the server match the requested=\r\n state. Leaving aside\nthe authorization conundrum for a moment, it might be=\r\n possible to\ntreat MOVE/COPY state expressions as a form of a &#39;diff-gram.&#39; =\r\nUpon\nGET-ting the state of a collection, the client could modify that state=\r\n\nand generate a difference graph that expresses the changes made by the\ncli=\r\nent. Upon receiving this difference graph, the server could modify\nthe serv=\r\ner collection to match the state sent by the client.\n\nThis GET collection s=\r\ntate, modify collection state and send the\nmodification back to the server =\r\nmay also be a hint for a way to handle\nother actions on collections.\n\nmca\nh=\r\nttp://amundsen.com/blog/\n\n\nOn Sun, Mar 22, 2009 at 04:50, Eric J.
