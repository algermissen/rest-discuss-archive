Seems a little tentative.  Are you sure you are ready\n&gt; for engagement with people who may be skeptical?  I suggest adding\n&gt; some reasons why they would want to do this.  Could be brief, as in\n&gt; one-liners with references to other pages that make the argument.\n&gt; Then I can have one page to send them to.  Needless to say, I will\n&gt; also reference this group, but it&#39;s more difficult to follow than the\n&gt; Wiki.\n\nNo - this isn&#39;t ready. It&#39;s only a place to start. I wanted to work out the\nactual REST details before showing it to actual ebXML working group members.\nAlso, there would need to be a focused &#39;why rest is good&#39; introduction that\nrelates it to ebXML reg/rep.\n\nMike\n\n"}}
