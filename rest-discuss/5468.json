For example: \n\n      Prefer:=\r\n http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/00345 \n\n      Over: http://www.parts-depo=\r\nt.com/parts?part-id=3D00345 \n\n      Rationale: the relationship between &#39;pa=\r\nrts&#39; and &#39;00345&#39; is\nclear, and you can instantiate subresources of &#39;00345&#39; =\r\neasily; this is\nnot possible if that information is tucked away in a query =\r\nstring.\n\n\nThis makes sense. On the other hand, in Paul Prescod&#39;s &quot;Common RE=\r\nST\nMistakes&quot;, he states that:\n\nDo not depend on URI&#39;s internal structure. S=\r\nome people think about\nREST design in terms of setting up a bunch of URIs. =\r\n&quot;I&#39;ll put purchase\norders in /purchases and I&#39;ll give them all numbers like=\r\n\n/purchases/12132 and customer records will be in /customers...&quot; That\ncan b=\r\ne a helpful way to think while you are whiteboarding and\nchatting, but shou=\r\nld not be your final public interface to the service.\n\n\nSo, is it &quot;best pra=\r\nctice&quot; to represent a resource like this:\nhttp://www.parts-depot.com/parts/=\r\n00345 \n\nand if not, how should is be represented witout using a query strin=\r\ng?\n\nThanks for any advice and I look forward to participating in this group=\r\n.\n\nJack Coleman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
