That&#39;s why\n&gt; &gt; I always call it XML Messaging. Unfortunately, most of the vendors\n&gt; &gt; have created API&#39;s which completely ignore this messaging paradigm,\n&gt; &gt; and indeed offer RPC-like functionality.\n&gt;\n&gt; Pah. It started out as RPC. It just moved to messaging as soon as it\n&gt; became clear that it didn&#39;t really work.\n\nMost of the Java APIs are still in the SOAP-as-RPC wold view.\n\nI have a theory for this, and, its not just &#39;its the vendors&#39; fault.\nActually I have two.\n\ntheory one: the sapir-whorf hypothesis in action.\nJava and C# use RPC (or method calls on objects) because it is the\nthing that the languages allow you to express. If everything in in\nyour language&#39;s world view is an object you make synchronous method\ncalls on, that is how you view the world.\n\nlanguages that are more messaging-centric could help here, be they\nErlang, Smalltalk or some extensions to the existing languages (ooh,\ncontinuations!)\n\n\ntheory two: developers dont want to do distributed computing.\n\nThis is my newer theory, and needs some expansion. Rather than say\n&#39;its the tool vendor&#39;s fault&#39;, I&#39;m now suspecting that the normal\ndeveloper out there is quuite happy to pretend that everything is\nrunning on a single box. That is even if their gui is a web page,\npossibly a fancy AJAXy page, they still like to pretend that stuff is\nworking locally. RPC-based IPC can maintain that illusion, even if it\nis just a big illusion.\n\nI don&#39;t know how you test this. But I think it could be one argument\nabout why applets, Java Web start and the like have failed to go\nmainstream. That is, the problems there are not just technical, but\narchitectural.\n\n-steve\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I blame the vendors, not the spec.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes. They must take a lot of the blame.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Nic Ferrier\n&gt; http://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
