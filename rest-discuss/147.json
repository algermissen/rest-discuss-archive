That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to\n&gt; preserve. I don&#39;t want a bunch of conventions that client and server\n&gt; have to agree to use through email. For simple cases I want it to &quot;just\n&gt; work&quot;.\n\nAbsolutely.  Me thinks Jeff is straying from the opacity &quot;axiom&quot;.\n\nFWIW, we at PF struggled with this some time ago, but what we have now\nis *lean*, I mean completely kick ass.  It&#39;s a shame we&#39;re not even\nreleasing free binaries (nevermind source).  It does everything you&#39;re\ntalking about here, but so much more.\n\nBTW, as I said to Jeff off-list, we won&#39;t be issuing any patents around\nthis type of stuff - that would be silly, for all the usual reasons.\nBut that means there&#39;s a lot of stuff I can&#39;t talk about until we&#39;re\nready to talk about it. 8-(\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
