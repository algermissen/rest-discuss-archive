That&#39;s why I\ndefined the Behavior pattern in &#39;REST for the r=\r\nest of us&#39; [1]\n(although, I&#39;m thinking about renaming it to something less =\r\nabstract).\n Like anything else, it should be used only when required, but w=\r\nhen it\nis required, it shouldn&#39;t be shunned.\n\n- Steve\n\n--------------\nSteve=\r\n G.
