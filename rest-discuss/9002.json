That may explain why he did not react to\n&gt; questions about the more controversial aspects of Java technology in\n&gt; the same way as some others in the Java platform industry do. He is\n&gt; taking the long view beyond Java to innovations using REST and Web-\n&gt; oriented architecture (WOA) or as he terms it &quot;SOA on the Web.&quot;\n\n\nwell, the puprose of corporate R&D  is to lead the company into the\nfuture.
