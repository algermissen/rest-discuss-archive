More detailed comments\nfollow, but without having read the WD-Proxy spec in detail yet.\n\nProxies\n=======\n\nA proxy oriented approach has been a ghost in the backround of these\nconversations all along.  I have stayed away from it because whenever I try to\nmodel the actual interactions using proxies I find an awkward fit in using\nproxies to do active work.  The syntax of a request to a proxy is slightly\ndifferent than the syntax of a request to a normal host.  As a result the end\napplication can&#39;t be a CGI script.  I don&#39;t advocate that implementations should\nonly ever be CGI, but rather that it must be possible for implementations to be\nCGI.  I advocate this because of the huge boost to adoption that CGI enables --\nthe backdoor is often the only door for new technology.\n\nNow, there&#39;s a question of whether most servers will accept a proxy request\nwhere the Host: header is their own domain.  I tested this just now by setting\nmy proxy server to yahoo.com and requesting http://www.yahoo.com.  When I set my\nproxy as a user preference in Opera, I got back a 200 OK but no content.  When I\nset Opera to use Muffin as a proxy, then set Muffin to use Yahoo as a proxy,\nthen requested yahoo.com (as well as hotmail.com) I got successful test results.\n...inconclusive, obviously.  A question: to what degree is a request to a proxy\na legal request to an endpoint server?\n\nA really great reason to use a proxy approach is that proxies can already handle\nthe request-in-request pattern.\n\nOne-shots\n=========\n\nI haven&#39;t been able to think of a problem with one-shot notifications, and I\nhave been able to think of advantages.  So I am a strong +1 for this.\n\nNOTIFY method\n=============\n\nI am strongly against new methods.  For one, they&#39;re about as un-REST as you can\nget.  For another, they make adoption a long, slow, painful process.  Any design\nthat requires new methods will be adopted at tenth the pace of one that doesn&#39;t.\nIf the HTTP Events spec ends up requiring new methods, I will almost certainly\nfork and make a version that enables implementations to avoid new methods.\n\nWD-proxy uses an orthogonal header for the request:\nproxy-option= &quot;notify&quot; | &quot;loging&quot; | log\n\nThis is a really good solution.  Any other approach requires the request to\ncontain both a request method and a watched resource method.  That&#39;s r-i-r, and\nwhenever I see r-i-r I see a problematic solution.  ...R-i-r is something like\nan infinity -- whenever a design leads you to an infinity you should question\nyour approach.  It&#39;s not that RIR is evil, just that it&#39;s best avoided until\nsomebody does a careful analysis/cookbook for making it work.\n\n&gt; So just finished an afternoon reread of Ari Luotonen&#39;s book,\n&gt; hadn&#39;t looked at it in a couple of years;\n\nwhich book, Jeff?\n\n&gt; also some material\n&gt; online.  I&#39;ve *almost* convinced myself that HttpEvents as we are\n&gt; currently discussing them are mostly extraneous.  I&#39;m going to\n&gt; say some things about my understanding of the current very rough\n&gt; but gradually converging consensus, then lay out the strawman for\n&gt; why this approach is unnecessary.  It&#39;s a straw man, whack away.\n\n*whack* *whack*  :)\n\nIMO WD-proxy is good but not quite there.  Let&#39;s finish the job --\nhttp://www.janeylee.com/oldhome/mmbattle.au !!!!!\n\n- Lucas\n\n\n"}}
