Nothing\nprevents a server from initiating its own connections.  Firewalls and\nNAT make deployment of such a system difficult on the Internet, but\nthat&#39;s why they are there -- the real world doesn&#39;t want someone else&#39;s\nautonomous agent running around on their systems.\n\nLikewise, collaborative agents do poorly if they depend on ephemeral\ncommunication (like watching messages go by on a p2p network).  A more\nrobust architectural style for those agents is the blackboard model,\nwhich is data-oriented (like REST), independent of the protocol\nused to set state on the blackboard, and capable of separating private\nfrom public information.\n\nHTTP does not support mobile agents (regardless of their agent-hood).\nSomeone could add a method for mobility (i.e., \nhere-is-my-code-and-state),\nbut deploying it would require too many religious battles to be worth\nthe effort.  It also doesn&#39;t buy much over a raw TCP connection with\nSSH or TLS authentication.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
