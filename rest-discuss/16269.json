Bowman&quot; &lt;eric@...&gt;\nCc: Jan Algermiss=\r\nen &lt;algermissen1971@...&gt;, Peter Williams\n&lt;pezra@...&gt;, Rest=\r\n List &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n\n\nI think there is a fundamental quest=\r\nion that should clarified\nunequivocally by the experts on this list - I do =\r\nhave a opinion but\nI&#39;m not a expert so it&#39;s just that, a opinion.\n\nIs REST =\r\nrealm - the problem-space where it should be applied, or where\nit makes sen=\r\nse to apply it - exclusively the Web? Or it should, or it\ncan, be applied t=\r\no the more general space of network-based software\narchitectures, thus incl=\r\nuding intranets (network based apps that runs\nexclusively inside a company)=\r\n and extranets (the use of private\nnetworks and/or the public infrastructur=\r\ne of the internet to connect a\nlimited number of companies - considering li=\r\nmited does not equal\nsmall)?\n\nBecause if it is indeed only applicable to th=\r\ne Web - and please note\nthat Web !=3D Internet - to making websites that ar=\r\ne going to be used by\nhumans using a browser, most of the discussions here =\r\ndon&#39;t really make\nsense. Otherwise, some people assumptions when they deal =\r\nwith the\nissues presented on this list are, to say the least, limited. Or p=\r\nlain\nwrong, not to say the least. Now I do understand that one or the other=\r\n\napproach may have to do with each one background, people who&#39;s work is\nlim=\r\nited to the web may have a different point of view than others who\nworked o=\r\nver several areas and platforms along the years.\n\nFor instance, what is the=\r\n sense in saying &quot;Media type identifers\ninform clients what codec or engine=\r\n to use for deciphering the\npayload&quot; if my clients are *not* browsers? And =\r\nalso please someone\ncorrect if I&#39;m wrong by saying &quot;ubiquitous&quot; !=3D &quot;stand=\r\nard&quot;...\n\nWhile it is true that intermediaries don&#39;t look inside the msg to\n=\r\nperform their function, why is that true also for servers that are not\nweb-=\r\nservers? If I have a application/mystuff+xml, all the\nintermediaries unders=\r\ntand what they need to understand - they read\nthis as application/xml. Why =\r\nshould the server be limited to this,\nknowing that I, as a architect/design=\r\ner, although I =A0*do not* have\ncontrol on intermediaries I *do* have contr=\r\nol over the server? The\ncoupling using application/xml or application/mystu=\r\nff+xml is, from\nthis point of view, exactly the same. And I do see advantag=\r\ne of using\n&quot;application/mystuff+xml&quot; on content-negociation *on the server =\r\nside*,\nbecause like that I can even put that content-negociation on my\n*ser=\r\nver-side connector* - which I also control, thus relieving the\nserver from =\r\nworkload, improving balancing, implementing scalability\nand effectively imp=\r\nlementing layered design - but of course all this\nis just impelementation.\n=\r\n\nAlso, and all please excuse my rant but these things must be said...\nwhy s=\r\nome people on this list insist in treating people sometimes like\nmorons and=\r\n sometimes like little kids in the classroom in front of the\nmaster? Should=\r\nn&#39;t we all consider the others as pairs, even if the\nknowledge of some are =\r\nsuperior to the one of others? Aren&#39;t we all\nprofessionals? What&#39;s the &quot;you=\r\n kids&quot;? I&#39;m trying not to say harsh\nwords, but do I have to publicize that =\r\nI develop software for the past\n30 years, 27 of then as a professional, 20 =\r\nof then as a independent\nconsultant / contractor? That I started to do web =\r\nsites since the\nearlier 90&#39;s and I kept working on the web (although not ex=\r\nclusively)\nuntil as recently as 2007, when I designed and implemented a web=\r\n-site\nlogin method using telephony - where you had to call a number to be\na=\r\nuthorized to enter the site and you will be logged in until you hang\nup the=\r\n call. Should I also say that I did a web site to a chicken\ndelivery servic=\r\ne - I didn&#39;t put that on my CV since I made it to a\nfriend and it was not a=\r\n paid job - or actually it was, I got paid in\nchickens... I even designed m=\r\nyself many animated gif&#39;s... How&#39;s that\nfor publicity? I don&#39;t know, maybe =\r\nit&#39;s just me that dislike being\ntreated with this kind of disdain?\n\nNeverth=\r\neless, I really think that this list should clarify the\nquestion I talked a=\r\nbove, because frankly if REST is only about the\nweb, I am plain wrong in my=\r\n approach and it is better for me to\nunderstand that now and move on to oth=\r\ner technologies. And I think\nothers will benefit from that clarification al=\r\nso.\n\n\n\nOn 12 August 2010 07:19, Eric J. Bowman &lt;eric@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Media type identifers inform clients what codec or engine to use=\r\n for\n&gt; deciphering the payload. Nothing more. Clients are limited by how\n&gt; =\r\nrecent their codec/engine is for the given type, or how fully they\n&gt; implem=\r\nent that type. Media type identifiers are _not_ meant to say\n&gt; anything abo=\r\nut the nature of the payload. Doing so would introduce\n&gt; coupling, violatin=\r\ng the layered-system constraint, and result in more\n&gt; media types than anyo=\r\nne could possibly keep up with, defeating the\n&gt; whole purpose of self-descr=\r\niptive messaging.\n&gt;\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
