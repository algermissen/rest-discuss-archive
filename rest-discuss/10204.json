My question is what&#39;s appropriate/ac=\r\nceptable to\n&gt; &gt; put there? Could it be just a URI template and then the cli=\r\nent would\n&gt; &gt; use that template to go directly to the resources it&#39;s lookin=\r\ng for?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s what my current situation is. My client application a=\r\npplication\n&gt; &gt; manipulates &quot;content records&quot; that it identifies by a URN th=\r\nat takes\n&gt; &gt; the form of: &quot;mgid:[foo]:[bar]:[baz]:[id]&quot;. To the client, thi=\r\ns isn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; just an opaque string. It understands the concept of foos, bars=\r\n, etc.\n&gt; &gt; and can extract them from the URN. (FWIW, these are design decis=\r\nions\n&gt; &gt; that were made long ago and I have no control over.) Would it be\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; appropriate for me to put something like this as the starting point\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nfor all clients?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://service.mysite.com/v{version}/mgid/{foo}/{b=\r\nar}/{baz}/{id}\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Then whenever the client accesses the service, it do=\r\nes a GET on\n&gt; &gt; http://service.mysite.com/ , parses the URI template, and c=\r\narries on.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Does that sound reasonable? I gotten suggestions from so=\r\nme people (who\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t know REST well at all) to POST the URN and respond=\r\n with the\n&gt; &gt; correct URI or redirect to it. This, I&#39;m pretty sure, is a re=\r\nally bad\n&gt; &gt; idea.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; Michael\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
