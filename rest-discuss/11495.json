Ofcourse, having a code\n&gt; that matches with your resources is probably much simpler and we don&#39;t\n&gt; want to make the systems any harder than they are. But when you are\n&gt; talking about REST, what code is present in the server doesn&#39;t really\n&gt; matter.\n&gt;\n&gt; I guess I might be confused by what you mean by server side classes -\n&gt; obviously the code that actually handles the request will be very\n&gt; different for WS-* and REST, but if both want to achieve the same\n&gt; thing (say mailing a book) then why can&#39;t both have the same code\n&gt; underneath ?\n\nSorry for not being clear ... I was indeed speaking about the resource\nclasses themselves, not the business logic underneath (which should of\ncourse be shared).\n\nThe way this question comes out in Java land:  &quot;Can I use both JAX-WS\nand JAX-RS annotations on the same resource class to make my resource\nboth SOAP-accessible and REST-accessible?&quot;  Technically, there&#39;s\nnothing that stops you from doing this ... but it&#39;s most likely not a\ngood approach.\n\nCraig\n\n"}}
