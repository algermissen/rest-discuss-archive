It&#39;s a general frustration with many recurring\ndiscussions by many people here and elsewhere about REST as if\nit&#39;s primarily an alternative to SOAP, when in fact its origins\nhad very little to do with what are now called Web services. REST\nis an analysis of why the Web architecture works as well as it\ndoes, and a tool to understand what does and doesn&#39;t work well on\nthe Web.\n\n&gt; But if it&#39;s a general statement then it&#39;s not quite true is it?\n&gt;\n&gt; For example, the web works with cookies quite a lot. But cookies\n&gt; are not RESTfull.\n\nCookies are a great example because they actually cause a lot of\nproblems for the operation of caching proxies, among other issues.\nUnderstanding REST helps us to understand and predict such\nproblems for Web sites, Web apps, and Web services alike. Cookies\ndo violate REST, and they do cause problems on the real Web.\n\nSo a clearer way to state my original point is that Web apps and\nWeb services are equal in the eyes of REST. When I&#39;m designing a\nWeb service, I think about how I&#39;d do it as a Web app as well, and\nconsider what REST tells me about both. And REST needs at least as\nmuch advocacy in the Web app world as in the Web service world at\nthis point.\n\n&gt; &gt; Want to offer the user multiple representations? Go ahead and\n&gt; &gt; give each one a different extension. Why not?\n&gt;\n&gt; Because cool-uris don&#39;t change:\n\nSo the cool URI for each version doesn&#39;t change. That doesn&#39;t mean\nyou can&#39;t have multiple URIs for multiple renditions of a file, if\nthose different renditions are meaningful to a user such that a\nuser would actually want to request one or the other (or several\ndifferent versions).\n\n&gt; &gt; It helps the user understand what they&#39;re getting, besides the\n&gt; &gt; fact that it just works. Even if you&#39;re using &lt;link\n&gt; &gt; rel=alternate&gt;, you need to give a distinct URI for each\n&gt; &gt; representation so the browser can actually grab what the user\n&gt; &gt; asked for.\n&gt;\n&gt; Err... no. As discussed you can use the Accept header to\n&gt; identify which resource you want.\n\nNot really -- Accept doesn&#39;t guarantee (and certainly doesn&#39;t\n*identify*) getting a particular representation, it expresses\npreferences and abilities to allow negotiation of an appropriate\ncontent type between the client and the server.\n\n&gt; &gt; Content negotiation is not for parameterizing a request in\n&gt; &gt; order to get specific versions of a document. Parameters\n&gt; &gt; intended to explicitly request a specific thing should go in\n&gt; &gt; the URI (for example, as a &quot;.xxx&quot; extension on the\n&gt; &gt; &quot;filename&quot;). If I desire a PDF rendition of my bank statement,\n&gt; &gt; that&#39;s a specific resource that I care about. I don&#39;t want\n&gt; &gt; HTML; that would be a different resource. If, on the other\n&gt; &gt; hand, I merely desire my bank statement, and I don&#39;t care what\n&gt; &gt; specific file format it comes in, I&#39;m happy if my browser and\n&gt; &gt; the server conspire to give me the best representation that\n&gt; &gt; they both support, which is exactly what content negotiation\n&gt; &gt; is all about.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t understand your argument - surely the situation is\n&gt; exactly the opposite? Content negotiation is for selecting the\n&gt; representation of the document that the client wants to see.\n&gt; URIs should identify resources, NOT representations of\n&gt; resources.\n&gt;\n&gt; As long as they really are the same resource.\n\nResources are concepts. If I have separate concepts of &quot;bank\nstatement in PDF&quot; and &quot;bank statement in HTML&quot;, then two separate\nURIs (one ending in .pdf and one ending in .html) make the most\nconceptual sense. If I browse to the HTML rendition and then click\na link to download the PDF rendition, those are two separate\nresources as far as I&#39;m concerned. It&#39;s not content negotiation,\nbecause my browser fully supports both. PDF and HTML are actually\ndifferent enough in user experience that I would never expect\ncontent negotiation between them; content negotiation might\nhowever choose between PNG and GIF for an image rendered inline,\nbecause I have no conceptual distinction between them in that\ncase.\n\nBottom line is this: REST really says very little about what URIs\nshould look like. REST does say to use URIs to identify whatever\nneeds identifying, and to use hypertext to make those URIs known.\nAnything beyond that is aesthetics. It&#39;s good to make URIs\nmeaningful to whoever might look at them, and to leave out\nanything not relevant to what is being identified (most especially\nimplementation details like cgi, php, or jsp, but perhaps also\nfilename extensions *if that&#39;s not what&#39;s being identified\nconceptually*), but they are opaque to the REST architectural\nstyle itself.\n\nCheers,\nJustin\n\n\n"}}
