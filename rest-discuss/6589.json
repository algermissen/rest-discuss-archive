Message self-\n&gt; &gt; descriptiveness is an\n&gt; &gt; architectural constraint of REST and thus, if your messages are not\n&gt; &gt; self-descriptive\n&gt; &gt; (aka standardized all the way through) your system does not comply\n&gt; &gt; with REST.\n&gt;\n&gt; I strongly disagree with this assertion. I don&#39;t have a link to Mark&#39;s\n&gt; article where he makes a claim that &quot;self-descriptive&quot; means\n&gt; &quot;standardized&quot; so I can&#39;t really refute it.\nHere is the quote:\n&quot;InfoQ: So to be clear about this - does this mean that if I want to  \ndevelop a RESTful application, I can only use standardized message  \nformats? Some custom XML format of my own would be ruled out?\n\nMB: Strictly, yes, but remember that REST is an architectural style  \nfor very large scale systems. If you&#39;ve got a proprietary data format  \nthat you need to use, say, behind your firewall, or even between two  \ncompanies that long ago agreed to use this format, then you can still  \ngain a lot by moving *towards* REST (by adopting the uniform  \ninterface, URIs for identification, etc..), but you won&#39;t quite reach  \nit in this case because of the data. And there&#39;s nothing wrong with  \nthat per se. All it means, and all that REST is telling you, is that  \nthe data in these messages won&#39;t mean much to the outside world.&quot;\n\n( http://www.infoq.com/articles/mark-baker-REST )\n&gt; But I do refute the\n&gt; assertion.\nWell, self-descriptiveness is a constraint, so there isn&#39;t much point  \nin refuting... :-)\n\nKeep in mind though, that not being 100% RESTful isn&#39;t the same as  \n&#39;no utility at all&#39;. Still better to use a proprietary format (or  \nextension on top of a standardized one) than to fire up your IDE and  \ncreate yet another API to yet another stock service object. When the  \nAPI is uniform, the proprietary extensions are much more likely to  \ncome out as being similar enough to enable futire consolidation and  \neventually standardization.\n&gt;\n&gt; If REST requires that only &quot;standardized&quot; documents be used then as\n&gt; fas as I can see, it has almost no utility at all.\nYeah, that sounded grumpy :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; As far as I can see, in the field, people are using mostly simple XML\n&gt; based systems and HTML based systems.\nBut due to their lack of standardization, the evolvability benefits  \nof REST are not guaranteed (because the self descriptiveness  \nconstraint is violated).\n&gt;\n&gt; HTML systems rely, to a greater or lesser extent on microformats which\n&gt; are not &quot;standardized&quot;; they are simply recognized and\n&gt; documented.\nThat might count as &#39;standardization&#39; though. Thoughts?\n\n&gt; They are highly flexible and would be the poorer for\n&gt; standardization.\nThis puzzles me; flexibility is orthogonal to standardization, no?\n&gt;\n&gt; Arbitary XML can be acceptable for applications because it can rely on\n&gt; microformats; say the A element or the FORM element or the ITEM\n&gt; element (from RSS). There&#39;s nothing wrong with that.\nNot exactly sure what you mean here.\n\nJan\n\n&gt;\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Nic Ferrier\n&gt; http://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
