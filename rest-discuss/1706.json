As ISO says, y=\r\nou&#39;re not just\n&gt; &gt; exchanging data, you&#39;re making business commitments.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; There is something else going on, but it is an extension of HTTP. I\n&gt; thi=\r\nnk of things like WebDAV and Offer/Acceptance as plugins. \n\nAre you thinkin=\r\ng of Offer/Acceptance as a technical thing?\nIt can be implemented via sever=\r\nal technical protocols, including REST \n(as we discussed) or EDI-mailbox-st=\r\nyle SOAP (as in ebXML or \nRosettaNet) or email or fax or paper and ink, for=\r\n that matter.\n\nIn each case, what you want to end up with technically is a =\r\nsingle \ndocument spelling out the business commitment and signed by both \np=\r\narties to signify their agreement.\n\nBut the essence is in another dimension=\r\n, where the business \ncommitments live:  economic and legal.  \n\nAlso, this =\r\nis not a case of abusing HTTP as an application protocol, \nbut using it as =\r\nit was intended in order to achieve this purpose in \nthis other dimension.\n=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Rohit Khare had an interesting diagram in his recent Soap Routing\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nslide show where he added two layers on top the application \nprotocol:\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nLayer 8 - Economic (which is where business commitments cd go)\n&gt; &gt; Layer 9 =\r\n- Political.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was at the talk and in that context it was clear that h=\r\ne meant it \nmore\n&gt; as a joke. Not &quot;economic protocols&quot; like ebXML but &quot;econ=\r\nomic \nprotocols&quot;\n&gt; like -- how do I con venture capitalists into giving me =\r\nmoney?\n\nThanks, I suspected he didn&#39;t mean what I meant.  \nBut I took it se=\r\nriously anyway, and still like the idea.  \nAnd I think ISO and UN/CEFACT th=\r\nink about it in much the same way.\nWhat I hear from both groups now is that=\r\n there is a layer of business \nprotocols on top of the ISO stack, and then =\r\na layer of regulatory \nprotocols on top of the business protocols.\n\n-Bob Ha=\r\nugen\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\nrest-discuss-unsu=\r\nbscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
