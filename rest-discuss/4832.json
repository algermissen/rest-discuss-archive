I was asked the question\n(for the 100th time) a few weeks ago --- how to build a shopping\ncart that follows REST constraints --- and was a bit surprised\nthat I couldn&#39;t find any of my old e-mails on the subject.  I used\nit as one the primary examples in talks about the style.\n\n&lt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/ \nevaluation.htm#sec_6_3_4_2&gt;\n\nI did find a related discussion on www-talk\n\n&lt;http://www.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1995q3/0348.html&gt;\n\nand, lo and behold, there is a response from James Gosling\nthat is very close\n\n&lt;http://www.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1995q3/0354.html&gt;\n\n     - behaviour and state needs to be pushed out. Things like\n       shopping baskets are easy to do as Java applets. Since\n       there&#39;s no shared state between the client and server,\n       everything is cacheable. The server gets one &quot;put&quot;\n       when the customer pushes &quot;buy&quot;.\n\nAnd the message I sent about it here:\n\n&lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/3583&gt;\n\n\nCheers,\n\nRoy T.
