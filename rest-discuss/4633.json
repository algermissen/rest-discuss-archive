You could send a status report to a server\nto\n&gt; &gt; be stored. You could retrieve a status report. You could update a status\n&gt; &gt; report. You could delete a status report.\n&gt;\n&gt; (memories of mac vs pc? noun vb or vb noun :-)\nYes, there is some superficial similarity to some ancient user interfaces -\nbut I don&#39;t think there is any significance to it. The UI approaches were\nattempts to minimize the differences between the visual model and the users\nmental model, whereas Web resources are meant to minimize a developers\neffort to work with many other distant organization&#39;s systems. But it is\nstill an interesting echo.\nThe Web resource approach is more of a transition from straight C functions\nto object oriented interface methods.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Then &#39;how do I do that&#39;?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   I use a resource (this sounds odd Mike),  to send a query to a\nserver\n&gt; &gt; using http\n&gt; &gt; One realization is that a query does not have to be a special or\nprivileged\n&gt; &gt; operation. You don&#39;t need to &#39;send a query&#39; - what you typically want to\ndo\n&gt; &gt; is to &#39;retrieve results&#39;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tell me that&#39;s not nit-picking please?\nIt&#39;s not nit-picking.\n\n&gt; why differentiate?\nBecause a &#39;query&#39; is not /required/ to be different than a retrieval. There\nis no uniqueness to it. It also shifts focus from\nfunctions/methods/operations to the actual data/information being exchanged.\nCreating uniformity between the two actions allows your systems to work with\nother people&#39;s software even if those other people don&#39;t know what your\nparticular &#39;query&#39; is supposed to mean. For example, how soon would\nAltaVista or Google assign a developer to build code to support &quot;Dave&#39;s\nQuery&quot;? If you were writing software to send purchase orders on a schedule\nto your multiple trading partners, how annoying would it be to adapt to each\nof those partner&#39;s systems, rather than just sending POST and the contents\nof the purchase order?\n\n&gt;   Go to the shop vs get a newspaper?\n&gt; Same thing?\nNo, the difference is that &quot;go to the shop&quot; is the detailed implementation\napproach, whereas &quot;get a newspaper&quot; is the result regardless of the\nimplementation.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Think in terms of the data & not the operation.\n&gt; The data I want vs how to get it(the query)? Makes sense.\nExcellent.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The result set is the interesting bit, not the way the query itself is\n&gt; &gt; written. The simplest and most generic thing is just to get the results.\n&gt; &lt;grin/&gt; Unsubtle use of get??\nColor me guilty.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (question: Does the recipient *have* to be a server?\n&gt; &gt; The term &#39;server&#39; just means a request handler. Any piece of software\nthat\n&gt; &gt; has socket based network library can accept incoming messages. You can\nfind\n&gt; &gt; HTTP listeners in embedded micro-controllers, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; Good. I&#39;d hate to ask all systems to host server software!\nOh, but imagine what could be possible if they did! Google Desktop search is\na Web server. It listens on 127.0.0.1 port 4664 (at least on my machine -\nhttp://127.0.0.1:4664/search&s=159658647?q=rest). Think of all the software\nyou could write and the only &quot;API&quot; you need is HTTP GET. Now all I have to\ndo is figure out how to get the freakin&#39; software to emit XML and we&#39;re\ngolden... Universal plug-n-play hardware devices many times are just Web\nservers (http://www.upnp.org/download/UPnPDA10_20000613.htm).\n\n\n"}}
