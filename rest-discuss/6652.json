At the moment the web is a net of resources connected by untyped \nassociations. If you visit a resource that represents a person, stating \nand linking to his work and recommended readings, you as a human reader \ncan figure out, which papers he wrote. A spider collecting information \nabout people  and their work would not be able to distinguish between \nthe links. The xlink:role attribute makes it possible for a computer \nprogram to make that distinction and enable it e.g. to walk up a family \ntree on the the female line.\n\nI am having doubts that the role attribute and it&#39;s application are \nconsidered a *topic* on this list. The reasons why a client interacts \nwith resources, the way he does is here of lesser interest than what \nhappens if he does and how the communication between him and the server \nshould look like. *But* by incorporating the xlink:role attribute one \ncould probably write more generic consumers of a RESTful API.\n\nKind regards,\nRobert Cerny\n\n[1] http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xlink-20010627/#link-semantics\n\nj_mckitrick wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m new to REST, and I just ran across a slide presentation about how \n&gt; xlink:role could be the\n&gt; key to automating the selection of xlinks from an xml message to \n&gt; traverse to a new URI and\n&gt; therefore a new state.\n&gt;\n&gt; There is not a lot of info out there on xlink:role.
