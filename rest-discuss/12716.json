Even if you\ndo something like do=\r\ncuments (hoping to the source events at the\nserver) this will only work in =\r\nextremely naive circumstances.\n\n&gt; More importantly, by defining multiple me=\r\nssages carrying intent, you enforce\n&gt; the client to understand those, which=\r\n is coupling the client to the details\n&gt; of what commands exist, which mean=\r\ns the client needs an understanding of\n&gt; each of those commands. I compare =\r\nthat to the case of understanding the\n&gt; media type to send a representation=\r\n, and understanding how to follow links,\n&gt; and I&#39;d argue that the latter ha=\r\ns lower coupling, with higher implementation\n&gt; cost.\n\nthe client knows what=\r\n operations are actually supported (it being the\nmessages contain data as w=\r\nell wouldn&#39;t it still need to know about\nthem?)? it is the one that represe=\r\nnts the behaviors the two are\nconceptually coupled. the only time they are =\r\nnot is when you do not\nhave a behavior oriented UI (i.e. they are data orie=\r\nnted). using cqs\nyour interface should be behavior oriented (not data orien=\r\nted).\n\nCheers,\n\nGreg\n\nOn Tue, May 19, 2009 at 4:05 PM, Sebastien Lambla &lt;se=\r\nb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t disagree with you, it&#39;s a matter of t=\r\nradeoffs.\n&gt;\n&gt; Designing a ReST architecture requires the client being instr=\r\nucted in what\n&gt; to do next in the media type definition, aka your document =\r\nformat.
