Bowman wrote:\n&gt;  &gt;An ETag on a 410 response doesn&#39;t make any sense at all. It implies that\n&gt;  &gt;there is a variant that a client *could* request, but the 404/410 status\n&gt;  &gt;implies there isn&#39;t any.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s what I thought at first, too. But I took another read of REST and\n&gt; RFC 2616 and changed my mind:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Response messages may include both representation metadata and resource\n&gt; metadata: information about the resource that is not specific to the\n&gt; supplied representation. .. Depending on the message control data, a\n&gt; given representation may indicate... the value of some other resource...\n&gt; [like] a representation of some error condition for a response.&quot; (5.2.1.2)\n\nSpeaking just for me; I really don&#39;t care what Rest says here. What&#39;s \ninteresting to me is whether this is compliant to RFC2616,\n\n&gt; I think an ETag is representation metadata, not resource metadata. I see\n\nSee &lt;http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2616.html#rfc.section.6.2&gt;:\n\n&quot;The response-header fields allow the server to pass additional \ninformation about the response which cannot be placed in the \nStatus-Line. These header fields give information about the server and \nabout further access to the resource identified by the Request-URI.&quot;\n\n&gt; nothing in RFC 2616 to support caching any 4xx response, whereas 301 says\n&gt; it MAY be cached and 307 says it MUST NOT be cached. But you can send a\n&gt; no-cache directive and an ETag with any 4xx error containing an entity\n&gt; body, and the ETag will only pertain to (one variant of) that\n&gt; representation of an error condition:\n\nI&#39;m not sure how caching is relevant here.\n\n&gt; &quot;Entity tags are used for comparing two or more entities from the same\n&gt; requested resource... An entity tag MUST be unique across all versions\n&gt; of all entities associated with a particular resource. A given entity \n&gt; tag value MAY be used for entities obtained by requests on different URIs.&quot;\n&gt; (RFC 2616, 3.11)\n&gt; \n&gt; I interpret this as saying that I can set ETag: &quot;410Gone&quot; for any 410\n&gt; response on my server (the entity body is the same every time). Any\n\nI guess we&#39;ll continue to disagree whether a 404/410 response is a \nrepresentation of a resource. As far as I am concerned, it is not. It&#39;s \nthe way how the server states that there is no representation it can \nsend, so an ETag on that message is meaningless.\n\n&gt; ...\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n"}}
