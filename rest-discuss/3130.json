But I think that a significant number think -\n&gt; and more importantly, have written software that assumes - that &quot;store&quot;\n&gt; means, well, &quot;store&quot;. 8-)\n\nI am guessing that many (maybe even most) implementations implicitly assume\nthat PUT is being used by a limited/controlled number of clients (usually\none) on a given URI.  For example, if I were to update my website using PUT,\nI am the sole user of PUT on any given URI.  This allows me to &quot;safely&quot;\nstate that my html file was stored &quot;as is&quot; at that request-URI.\n\nHowever, suppose you have a URI that is being updated by several clients\nindependently.  For example, suppose that you have a client that scans all\ndocuments and auto-corrects misspelled words.  In this case, a\nPUT-followed-by-GET would not guarantee that the returned entity would be\nthe same as the one sent in the first place because PUTs from other\nclient(s) could happen in between the PUT and GET operations.\n\nNow, if you were to take this a bit further, the server itself could update\nthe resource between the PUT and GET.  If you want, think of it as an\nimplicit GET-followed-by-PUT where the server is acting like a &quot;client&quot;.\nThe end result would be no different from another client performing the same\noperation.\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t know how much software out there makes this assumption, but\n&gt; I&#39;d be willing to bet money that anybody developing software that\n&gt; doesn&#39;t make this assumption, will eventually have problems when it\n&gt; discovers the other software.\n\nIt seems to me that adding a constraint where &quot;store&quot; means &quot;as is&quot; will be\nthe more likely cause of the problems.  Taking a looser interpretation can\nstill allow &quot;as is&quot; when it&#39;s needed without forcing thos blinders all\nimplementations.\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
