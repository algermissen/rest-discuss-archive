Yes, in theory we could invest the time to \n&gt; define a media type that embodies all the semantics we need to \n&gt; capture.  In practice, that is more work up front than if we follow \n&gt; the &quot;web services&quot; path, define a WSDL interface, and generate the \n&gt; code we need.  Especially when we know it is almost a certainty that \n&gt; the client and server in these cases will change together, the extra \n&gt; work of figuring out a fully REST approach is actually unnecessary, \n&gt; and consequently inappropriate.\n\nWell, the value you get from REST depends on how distributed the system \nis e.g. the above approach wouldn&#39;t work for the web, but that&#39;s not \nbecause the clients are human rather than machine\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course, in aspiring to REST, we do use tools like JAX-RS, which of \n&gt; course don&#39;t magically transform our code to &quot;REST&quot;, but they do start \n&gt; us down the path of &quot;REST&quot;.  Whether we get there or not depends on \n&gt; the use-cases and requirements for the software.  Which I think is as \n&gt; it should be.\n\nOk, but this might present a problem if the &#39;easiest up front&#39; solutions \nto short term requirements (e.g. &quot;web services&quot;) become costly in the \nlong term?\n\nI agree there&#39;s a &#39;middle-way&#39; that presents the best of both worlds, \nperhaps this is Level 2 RMM?\nhttp://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html#level2\n\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n"}}
