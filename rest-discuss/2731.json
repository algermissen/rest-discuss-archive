I&#39;m not sure the\n&#39;never-ending response&#39; /requires/ two connections. By the way, this is also\nhow KnowNow does stuff (response going to a browser has multiple events,\neach is picked up by javascript on the client and dispatched to app code on\na page).\n\nI think the &#39;TURN&#39; approach is what we&#39;ve talked about here - Mark or\nsomebody suggested the &#39;protocol upgrade&#39; aspect of HTTP may be able to help\nout here. ClipCode says this is &#39;not standard http&#39; and recommends BEEP, but\nI think the initiation is the only part not purely HTTP (and even then, it\nfollows the rules of extensions).\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/1980\nNobody challenged whether Upgrade is all that is needed for &#39;client behind\nfirewall&#39; or CONNECT is required - does anybody really know?\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;S.

A simple form of tunnelling which does\n&gt; not break HTTP in any way - other than intermediaries, which shouldn&#39;t be\na\n&gt; concern in this situation anyway (since the alternative is a custom\n&gt; protocol).\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
