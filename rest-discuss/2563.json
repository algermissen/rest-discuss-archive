It&#39;s very annoying to go \n&gt; through all the trouble of parsing an XML document just to discover \n&gt; it contains no useful information. HTTP has a rich set of built in \n&gt; response codes you should use.\n\nmmm, I was debating this myself, in the end I opted for XML because I \nactually found it easier to work with than HTTP codes. I am coding \nfrom a PHP background, so maybe I&#39;m missing some functionality that \nothers are taking for granted, but it&#39;s actually a lot easier to \nparse a response document and check it for errors than it is to \nmanipulate an HTTP header (although it does introduce some \nunfortunate overheads in the XML tags etc). Who do other people feel \nabout this? Would people prefer to use HTTP headers to determine \nerrors?\n\n&gt;     2.2) Similarly, the behavior you expose tends to be made \n&gt; redundant by HTTP. For example, your method doGetCachedPage simply \n&gt; returns the HTML of the cached page straight from google. Rather \nthan \n&gt; doing this, I&#39;d suggest issuing an HTTP Redirect to the client so \n&gt; they can retrieve the cached page themselves.\n\ndoGetCachedPage actually cleans up the document a little bit before \nsending it to the client. When returned directly from Google&#39;s cache, \nthe page has the Google header on it (the same as if you view a \ncached page from Google.com), this is removed before sending the page \nback to the XooMLe client.\n\n&gt; 3) This is trivial but I don&#39;t really see the need for the top-\nlevel \n&gt; XML element &#39;doGoogleSearchResponse&#39; since that&#39;s a bit verb-like. \n&gt; Having &#39;GoogleSearchResult&#39; as the root seems cleaner to me. Also, \n&gt; since XML is case-sensitive and since ppl will be writing xslts to \n&gt; handle Xoomle responses I&#39;d suggest being consistent with your \nnaming \n&gt; convention. Since you&#39;re using camel-casing it seems \n&gt; like &#39;GoogleSearchResult&#39; should be &#39;googleSearchResult&#39;.\n\nThat one wasn&#39;t my personal choice. In developing the XML response \ndocument, what I have actually done is to just take the SOAP envelope \nthat is returned, then strip it down to something simpler. I suppose \nI should have taken out that additional element (and I left \ntheir &quot;case&quot;ing as-was as well), but I left it in because that&#39;s what \nwas there to start with, so the XML-version is a lightweight (but \nvery similar structure-wise) version of the SOAP version.\n\n&gt; 1) How do I pass the &#39;site:&#39; restriction to Xoomle? Is this just \n&gt; something the Google SOAP api forbids?\n\nyou should be able to do this as normal - for example, go to \nhttp://www.dentedreality.com.au/xoomle/search/ and \nenter &quot;site:dentedreality.com.au xoomle&quot; and it will return pages \ncontaining &quot;xoomle&quot; from my domain only :)\n\n&gt; 2) Is there any way to expose the directories offered by the Google \n&gt; Directory?\n\ndirectory information is offered (where available) within each \nresultElement in the reponse document. i.e. Search for &quot;information \narchitecture&quot; and in the first resultElement \n(doGoogleSearchResponse//GoogleSearchResult//resultElements//item\n[0]//directoryCategory//fullyViewableName) there is the \nvalue &quot;Top/Reference/Knowledge_Management/Information_Architecture&quot; \nwhich is used by Google to create a link to their Groups directory \n(They do a search and replace of &quot;/&quot; for &quot; &gt; &quot; for the visible name \nof the link, and link to \nhttp://directory.google.com/&lt;fullyViewableName&gt;)\n\n&gt; 3) Can you explain more about how max results work? \n\nmaxResults is a restriction that Google uses to determine how many \nresults to return on a particular query. i.e. you set maxResults=3 \nand it will only return 3 results (incidentally, if you set \nstart=10&maxResults=3, it will give results 10-13 of the total result \nset). In the Google API, maxResults is limited to a maximum \n(maxMaxResults?? :P) of 10. XooMLe &quot;cheats&quot; this limit by allowing \nyou to specify (for eaxmple) maxResults=30. The way it does this is \nby seeing that you want more than 10, it then gets the first 10, if \nthe estimatedTotalResultsCount is over 10, then it gets the next 10 \n(and so on and so on) until it has the number of results you asked \nfor. It then compiles these all into one response document, and sends \nit all back to you. BE AWARE that this counts as 3 queries \n(decrements your daily limit of 1000 by 3) even though from your end \nyou only do one query, since XooMLe obviously has to do 3 queries on \nyour behalf. As a side note, the searchTime element is summed based \non the amount of time each query took, so it is still accurate, \nalthough will be higher than if Google allowed the larger single \nrequest obviously.\n\n&gt; 4) What do the plain-text spelling suggestions response look like? \n&gt; Are you sure you don&#39;t want to return an XML document instead?\n\nTry it out - http://www.dentedreality.com.au/xoomle/spell/\nThey just have the standard headers, then the plain text response. If \nyou parse the source of the URL required to get a reponse, then it \nwill have nothing but the suggestion in it.\n\nOk, there we go, hope that answers some questions and indicates my \nintentions :) Thanks a lot for your feedback, I really appreciate it. \nThis is a large learning experience for me, and I hope some other \npeople are learning some things and finding something useful along \nthe way as well :)\n\nRegards,\n\nBeau\n\n\n"}}
