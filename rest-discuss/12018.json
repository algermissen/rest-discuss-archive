But out of curiosity, what are the\n&gt;&gt; efficiency concerns? Compared with what?\n&gt; Well, the issues aren&#39;t always that precisely articulated, more just\n&gt; background concerns. However, as part of the project we will be\n&gt; integrating query services and metadata stores produced by independent\n&gt; teams. One of the teams is successfully using SQL over ODBC as their\n&gt; current query interface, and they&#39;re wondering what impact moving to a\n&gt; resource-oriented approach will have. This is an enterprise/intranet\n&gt; project, so we have more-or-less complete control over the\n&gt; inter-process interfaces. However, as a design goal we want to be able\n&gt; to bring new types and instances of stores and query services online\n&gt; with minimal effort, which is one reason why I favour a uniform\n&gt; abstraction like REST.\n&gt;\n&gt; The other candidate area for a RESTful interaction is between the\n&gt; rich-client (Flex) UI and the presentation tier. Here the comparison\n&gt; would be against something like Flex Data Services.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Ian\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
