The\n&gt; properties that define a RESTful architecture are leveraged by tools\n&gt; like HAProxy, Nginx, Squid, Varnish and various other\n&gt; intermediaries.  Once you have a good working grasp on how caching,\n&gt; etags, HTTP methods and response codes impact the entire system, then\n&gt; you can focus on building an app.  Being able to produce a service\n&gt; that fits into ecosystem becomes much more relevant then trying to\n&gt; drag someone to the conclusion without a tangible example.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just a thought.\n&gt; \n\nThis may well be a solution for describing to someone what REST *is*.\nMy hypothesis is that &quot;REST&quot; APIs fail to be RESTful due to a failure\nin mapping between architectural model, and implementation.  I&#39;m\nconcerned with those who already think they know they want REST, but\nneed help developing a system.  My proposed solution is to teach them\nhow to develop an architectural model, and help them map that model to\ntheir implementation.  I do not believe that REST can be taught, as it\nis an architectural style, by describing implementations.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
