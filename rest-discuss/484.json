Alexander Jacobson&quot; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; If notifications contain updates then they must be\n&gt; POSTs.  This seems ugly.\n\nI agree. In recent mails I&#39;ve been suggesting PUT.\n\n&gt; The agent requesting notification supplied a\n&gt; notification URI.  It is the responsibility of\n&gt; the subscriber to know to what resources that\n&gt; notification URI corresponds.\n\nOrthogonal issue. There is very little no cost in having a header with\nthe notification URI and it might be useful for simplifying client-side\nstate management.\n\n&gt; Unless we are prepared to specify a subsciption\n&gt; management protocol, there is no need to require\n&gt; that the subsciption resource be in the\n&gt; notification.\n\nWe are doing somewhat of a subscription management protocol. The latest\nspec (from yesterday) incorporates Jeff Bone&#39;s ideas about:\n\n 1. Expiry\n 2. Acknowledgment from the client that it really wants to be subscribed\n\nPlus we have always said that a client may unsubscribe by DELETEing a\nsubscription resource.\n\n&gt; If we care about synchronization, we should\n&gt; specify other HTTP methods for version management.\n&gt; These would be useful regardless of subscription.\n&gt; I think some are in WebDAV.\n\nAgreed.\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t think any of the existing HTTP methods\n&gt; communicate what notifcation communicates.  I\n&gt; think there are basically 3 messages, all of which\n&gt; have NO message bodies.\n\nThe message body is an important and useful *optimization*. Sending\ndiffs is really important for performance. They just have to be set up\nso that even if one is &quot;dropped&quot; you can resync easily by going back to\nthe subscription resource.\n\n&gt; CREATED /notification/path HTTP/1.1\n&gt; (allowing the ability to watch for the creation of\n&gt; certain types of resources)\n&gt; \n&gt; CHANGED /notification/path HTTP/1.1\n&gt; \n&gt; DELETED /notifiation/path HTTP/1.1\n&gt; when there will be no more changes\n&gt; and there is now no accessible info about the\n&gt; resource.\n\nI no longer think it is important to say which of these things happened.\nYou notify the resource of the change. Maybe you have a body that says\nwhat changed. Maybe you don&#39;t. If you don&#39;t, or it is useless because of\nsome message that was lost earlier, then you re-sync from the data\nsource.\n\nYou say CREATED is important because if allows you the ability to watch\nfor the creation of certain types of resources. But you could also model\nthis as a WATCH on a query. &quot;The list of all stock symbols.&quot;\n\nI think that a subscription could outlive a DELETEion. If the resource\ngoes away and them comes back and then goes away, why not keep\ndelivering notifications?\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
