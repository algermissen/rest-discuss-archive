Without an authoritative  \n&gt; document that\n&gt; explains REST in work-a-day developer terms in addition to the  \n&gt; rigorous\n&gt; language required by such authoritative documents, untold hours are  \n&gt; wasted\n&gt; in debate and by people simply trying to grok it all.\n\nTo the extent that such a document is possible for an architectural  \nstyle,\nthat document is my dissertation.  Anyone who claims that REST is  \nsomething\nother than what is in my dissertation is just babbling nonsense -- the\ndissertation defined the term (and other people making it a buzzword  \nwon&#39;t\nchange that).  People are free to claim that there is more to\n&quot;web architecture&quot; than what I included in REST, and that perhaps some\nof that should have been included in REST, but REST itself is just a  \nname\nchosen for a specific style that I defined as characteristic of the best\ndesigned parts of the Web.\n\nThe only way that REST changes over time is in the sense that I  \nsometimes\nneed to expand on the terse explanations provided in the dissertation,\nbecause I was in a hurry when I wrote it.  In most cases, such expansion\nis merely pointing people to other stuff I wrote ten years ago, or about\nthe entire topic of media type design which I left out because I ran out\nof time.  There are also other styles that build upon REST, but they are\n*other styles*.\n\nIn regards to &quot;untold hours wasted in debate&quot;, that is close to the goal\nof my dissertation -- to introduce a way of thinking about software\narchitecture that promotes honest debate about the properties that are\ndesired and actual thought applied to the constraints chosen to achieve\nthem (and their resulting trade-offs).  It is almost never wasted, even\nwhen it is poorly informed.\n\nMost people spend six months or so butting their preconceived notions\nof what&#39;s &quot;important&quot; against the REST constraints before realizing the\nbenefits of REST.  I am not surprised at all by that, since almost all\nof the design behind REST is focused on applications that need to\nsurvive for decades of independent evolution.  We all know that our\nsoftware industry rarely sees beyond today&#39;s build.  Expecting\n&quot;workaday developer teams&quot; to quickly understand REST, no matter how\ncarefully it is described, is just beyond reasonable expectations.\n\n&gt; Publishing such a\n&gt; document as an RFC or the equivalent for the IETF, with significant  \n&gt; examples\n&gt; would go a long way to avoid so much needless thrashing. Especially  \n&gt; when you\n&gt; consider how passionate many people on this list are in their  \n&gt; beliefs that\n&gt; strict adherence to the tenents of REST are essential.\n&gt;\n&gt; So I guess I&#39;m calling the question! Can we create an RFC, or some  \n&gt; other\n&gt; authoritative document that defines REST written in a language\n&gt; understandable by those not accustomed to reading and interpreting\n&gt; specifications?\n\nNo, at best all you will get is a committee that has some vague notion\nof what they consider to be design to write down the least common\ndenominator of misinformed &quot;best practice&quot; based upon whatever Microsoft\nchose to implement in its last release.  The IETF has made a habit of\nthat recently.\n\nI might write another book some day, assuming I ever get in the swing of\nwriting on a regular basis (and ignoring email).  I doubt that I would\ncall it a REST book, though it would contain REST.  I am sure the  \npublisher\nwould try to market it that way anyway.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
