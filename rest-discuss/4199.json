Let&#39;s\nsay you have a collection-type object A which contains B and C. One\nrepresentation for A might be:\n\n&lt;a&gt;\n  &lt;b&#39;s&gt;\n    &lt;b xlink:href=&quot;....&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;b xlink:href=&quot;....&quot; /&gt;\n    [ ... ]\n  &lt;/b&#39;s&gt;\n  &lt;c&#39;s&gt;\n     &lt;c xlink:href=&quot;....&quot; /&gt;\n     &lt;c xlink:href=&quot;....&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;/c&#39;s&gt;\n&lt;a&gt;\n\nThe question is, how to model the removal of a b from the\ncollection-type a? This isn&#39;t a DELETE operation since I don&#39;t want to\ndestroy the &#39;b&#39; I just want to remove it from &#39;a&#39;. One obvious\nsolution would be to POST something like a &#39;remove-b url=&quot;...&quot;&#39;\ndocument to the &#39;a&#39; resource but this seems like a kludge. What then,\nis the best way to model this operation RESTfully?\n\n- Buko O.\n\n\n"}}
