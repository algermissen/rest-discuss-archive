From the website:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &quot;REST-* is an organization dedicated to bringing the architecture of the\n&gt;  &gt; Web to common patterns in middleware technology&quot;.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; The name REST-* was, on purpose, supposed to convey images of WS-*.\n&gt;  &gt; Other than being tonque-and-cheek, and ignoring the negative\n&gt;  &gt; connotations of WS-*, WS-* generally equates to defining middleware:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &quot;The REST-* community aims to introduce new REST-based standards for\n&gt;  &gt; these traditional services&quot;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; The key word was *traditional*. What I think I should have said was:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &quot;The REST-* community aims to morph these traditional services into a\n&gt;  &gt; more RESTful approach through a set of open specifications.&quot;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m in total slackjawed awe that you guys conciously made this decision, \n&gt; as techincal people. At least you could blame your marketing folks, and \n&gt; distance yourself from the situation.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think you are sort of missing the point of Stefan&#39;s feedback and Roy&#39;s \n&gt; criticisms.\n&gt; \n&gt; You shouldn&#39;t come up with some one sentence catch-all slogan, either. \n&gt; Instead, you should probably look at your project analysis document and \n&gt; scope statement, understand what the heck it is you are trying to do, \n&gt; and explain what problems you are going to solve. To repeat,\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; &quot;The REST-* community aims to morph these traditional services into a\n&gt;  &gt; more RESTful approach through a set of open specifications.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; doesn&#39;t communicate anything but a big fat :words: emoticon, so people \n&gt; will just give you a :tl;dr: emoticon back.\n&gt; \n&gt; Honestly, I don&#39;t even understand how you are pushing REST at JBoss. I \n&gt; would expect whatever persuasion you used there to be mirrored in your \n&gt; marketing material to external devs. But I don&#39;t see it. What I see is \n&gt; fuzzy thinking. You might be right, but in no thanks to fuzzy thinking.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m mostly frustrated myself, dealing with a lot of dumb &quot;REST API&quot; \n&gt; libraries that simultaneously claim to be &quot;object-oriented&quot;, when they \n&gt; explicitly pass values down a call chain, creating a hierarchical \n&gt; dependency chain between callers and callees. This looks a lot like \n&gt; Structured Design to me, not OO. Also, I find vendors of &quot;REST APIs&quot; \n&gt; poorly document their own services. &quot;It&#39;s self-describing, you figure \n&gt; out what went wrong.&quot; I guess REST also means to these people &quot;ping \n&gt; service, random junk reply, you figure out what to do with it&quot;.\n&gt; \n\nI just hope that when we take all this feedback into account and revise \nboth the site, definitions, community setup, message, and specifications \nwe&#39;ll get as much feedback.\n\nJust to let you know, this was going to be announced in stages to build \nfeedback.\n\n1.
