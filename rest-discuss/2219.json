It&#39;s horrendously complex and it&#39;s not even simple enough \nto solve some of the trivial problems I&#39;m throwing at it (unless you \nrevert to using xs:token for every datatype which kind of defeats the \npurpose). I really don&#39;t like it and I don&#39;t see the average \ndeveloper liking and/or using it.\n\nI&#39;ve done a bit of research on the alternatives and I&#39;ve come across \nRELAX NG which is muuch better and simpler but the problem is that \nthe tool support for RELAX NG is non-existent. I&#39;m not aware of a \nRELAX NG API for either Java or .NET which is my primary audience at \nthis point.\n\nThat being said, I remember a while back Roger suggested that HTML \nshould be used to describe the XML/Interface for RESTful webservices \n(eg what gets POSTed to resource X). I didn&#39;t really understand what \nhe was saying then, but now it makes perfect sense to me. The primary \ngoal for interface specifications (primarily describing data \nstructures, that is the structure of XML documents) should be for \ndocumentation purposes, not code generation purposes (which is the \nonly real goal of XML Schema). Since no elegant or simple \ntechnologies exist to describe XML document structure, I&#39;m starting \nto lean towards Roger&#39;s solution of using HTML which is undeniably \nthe most accessible and understood markup language out there today.\n\nWhat do others think? \n\n\n"}}
