Fielding wrote:\n&gt; POST(a), as &quot;append this&quot;, is unsafe, non-idempotent, non-cacheable,\n&gt; operates on an unknown resource, and has only minor visibility since\n&gt; there is no way for an intermediary to anticipate the state of the\n&gt; resource after the append aside from &quot;some state was added&quot;.  POST(p),\n&gt; as &quot;process this&quot;, doesn&#39;t even have that minor visibility.\n\nI was under the impression that the degree of visibility in both cases\nwas identical, since the client has just as much trouble anticipating\nthe state of the resources as the intermediary.  What I think you&#39;re\ntalking about there - please correct me if I&#39;m mistaken - is the amount\nof information that can be extracted from a message.  But I wouldn&#39;t\npersonally call that amount of information &quot;visibility&quot; in the section 2\nof your dissertation sense-of-the-word, since to do so, it seems, would\nbe akin to suggesting that &quot;getStockQuote&quot; is more visible than GET\nsimply because it&#39;s more specific, i.e. is equivalent to the GET\nsemantic plus the expected type of the data (a stock quote).\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
