So for example, the phone book lists a\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Lisa B Simpson&quot; which could be used like this.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    GET /artist?name=Lisa%20B%20Simpson\n&gt; You&#39;ll still have to generate the URI on the client - why not just use\n&gt; &quot;/artist/Lisa%20B%20Simpson&quot; directly?\n\nBecause &quot;/artist/Lisa%20B%20Simpson&quot; does not exist. It is an unvalidated\nURI manufactured by an external User Agent from an entry in a phone book.\nThe URI on the Origin Server is &quot;/artist/LisaSimpson&quot;.\n\nThe /artist resource provides a mechanism for converting aliases into\nexisting URI on the origin server. It could have been named\n/find-artist (but this URI is not restful because it is a\nverb or service, I think).\n\n&gt; Sure, the HTML FORM element only provides a way to construct\n&gt; query terms in\n&gt; a URI, but several people would like to go beyond that. Really\n&gt; wish we had a\n&gt; standardized syntax & sample libraries...\n\nIt depends upon which way you want to go. A User Agent is expected to\ntreat a Path component (before the ?) as opaque but it is expected to\nunderstand and append query parameters to a search URI. I have\nbeen trying to locate where I read this, without success. It may have\nbeen in the HTML spec so perhaps this statement only applies to HTML\nbut I thought it was in something more general than that.\n\n&gt; &gt; The http path, /artist, suggests that only one artist should be\n&gt; returned,\n&gt; Not sure if that&#39;s a safe assumption. I suppose it&#39;s a reasonable guess -\n&gt; but I would easily implement something of similar naming that\n&gt; would return a list.\n\nLooking back at my original post it is completely wrong.    B^(\nI used /artist?name=Lisa%20Simpson and /artist?eye-color=Blue to\nreturn an &lt;artistlist&gt; so I cannot then use the same URI to return\nan individual artist. Perhaps /find-artist would be more appropriate.\n\nRegards\nDonald.\n\n\n"}}
