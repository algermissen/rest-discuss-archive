Putting it into practice means comments about\n&gt; boring things like broken software, which is why I am reporting on my\n&gt; experience with broken software.  In the long run the faction that this\n&gt; makes sense to will use this kind of report to make doing things in a\n&gt; RESTful way attainable.\n\nOk, we&#39;re good.  I think the take-away point is this; it&#39;s useful to\nboth have an architectural guide and a grasp of the practical issues\ninvolved in following such a guide, when designing Web apps (or anything\nelse, for that matter).  While most discussions on rest-discuss focus on\nthe guide, that doesn&#39;t mean that we don&#39;t understand, appreciate, or\neven discuss on occasion, the practical side of things.  Your\nobservation about problems with using PUT was welcome; your suggestion\nthat we don&#39;t appreciate those problems, not so much. 8-O\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
