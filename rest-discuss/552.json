Before that, I&#39;d say they were most influenced by the deisre\n&gt; to support versioning a la VMS.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;I&#39;m not clear on their current use, and was a bit surprised\n&gt; &gt;to see 2396 say that each path segment could have its own parameters, so\n&gt; &gt;that you could get:\n&gt; &gt;  http://www.foo.com/bar;a=1;b=2/baz/bat.gif;g=5\n&gt; &gt;and so forth. If anyone could clear up the history here, I&#39;d be grateful.\n&gt; \n&gt; Think of it as an issue of precedence.  In almost all URL parsers,\n&gt; the slash characters have precedence over any other character during\n&gt; routine parsing of components.  The result is that the path is\n&gt; separated into path segments before anything looks at the semicolons.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;With that in mind, a more HTTP-specific question: How should an\n&gt; &gt;origin server treat a request that includes parameters? Some trival\n&gt; &gt;testing suggests that current practice is to treat them as part of\n&gt; &gt;the path, so that an error is returned. Would it be better to have\n&gt; &gt;them ignore parameters that aren&#39;t understood?\n&gt; \n&gt; That is entirely dependent on the nature of the resource.  A server\n&gt; can interpret its own namespace however it wants.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; \n&gt; ....Roy\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- End forwarded message -----\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Mark Nottingham\n&gt; http://www.mnot.net/\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
