Can you explain.\n\nThis = the situation where you want the server to provide you with a &lt;form&gt; \nrepresentation of the resource.\n\n&gt;&gt; What URL should you hit to get the form to edit the resource.\n&gt; \n&gt; Either the MIME type prescribes this (like Atom PP defines that POSTing \n&gt; to collections creates a new entry) and thus the lient has somewhat hard \n&gt; coded what to do or the server needs to tell you by way of a shared (via \n&gt; MIME type) link semantic.\n\nSo when I send a xmlhttprequest GET to the server at http://foo.com/entry/1, \nyou&#39;re saying I can set a MIME type to tell the server to give me back a \n&lt;form&gt; representation for editing of that resource?\n\n&gt;&gt; Say your resource is at:\n&gt;&gt; http://foo.com/entry/1\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If I GET that URL, I&#39;d get a view of the resource in (x)html that&#39;s \n&gt;&gt; not editable.\n&gt; \n&gt; You cannot expect that, because the server will send what it considers \n&gt; most appropriate...and that might *NOT* be HTML.\n\nI&#39;m writing the server here as well so I determine what it sends back.  It&#39;ll \nbe xhtml.\n\n&gt;&gt; How do I get the form to edit it?\n&gt; \n&gt; The server will tell you. How it does so is beyond REST, it has to be \n&gt; defined in the shared message semantics (MIME type in HTTP land).\n\nWhat MIME type do I send to a server to request a &lt;form&gt; back rather than the \nxhtml to show me the entry in non-editable format?\n\n&gt;&gt; REST doesn&#39;t seem to understand the use of forms on the client side to \n&gt;&gt; do editing at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; What o you mean?\n\nREST doesn&#39;t seem to have any notion of the idea that there&#39;s generally (I \nknow, not always) a &lt;form&gt; needed to edit or create a new resource so it \ndoesn&#39;t provide you with a way (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to fetch the form \nusing the same resource URL.  I think your use of MIME types answers for this \nhowever, though I don&#39;t know how to actually tell it to give me a &lt;form&gt; using \nMIME.\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; How do I RESTfully get a form to create a new &quot;entry&quot;?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Wrong question :-) I should read: &quot;When I design my system, how do I \n&gt; support the use case of &quot;create a new entry&quot; so that the support for it \n&gt; does not violate REST constraints?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Answer: define message semantics that let the client find the form *at \n&gt; run time*.\n\nSo for a concrete example:\n\nIf I do a GET on /entries/1 with a certain MIME type, I&#39;m telling the server \nto send me a &lt;form&gt; representation of that resource.  If I use a different \n(the default) MIME type, it will send me back a (x)html view of the resource. \n  I think I can send a different MIME type to request a JSON or XML of the \nresource.\n\nIf I do a PUT on /entries/1, that would update it on the server.\n\nIf I do a POST on /entries/1, that would be invalid because I can&#39;t define the \nnew resource&#39;s ID on the client side so I&#39;d do a POST on /entries in order to \ncreate a new one and it would send me back an HTTP header with the ID in it?\n\nAnd, finally, I&#39;d do a DELETE on /entries/1 to delete it.\n\nIf I have this right, all I need is to know what MIME type you&#39;d use to \nrequest a &lt;form&gt; rather than an xhtml representation of the resource.\n\nPlease let me know how I&#39;m doing here!\n\nScott\n\n\n"}}
