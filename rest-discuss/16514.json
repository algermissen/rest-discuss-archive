Bowman wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Nathan wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; This issue is orthogonal to the &quot;making up a new media type for\n&gt; &gt;&gt; every resource encountered&quot; discussion, that&#39;s a best practise\n&gt; &gt;&gt; thing I hope we could discuss.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Shorter version of my point:  It would be great if we could\n&gt; &gt; stipulate that any theoretical identifiers under discussion are\n&gt; &gt; assumed to represent a proposed standard and are intended to be\n&gt; &gt; IANA-registered for use on the Web, _then_ have that debate about\n&gt; &gt; re-use vs. evolving new types.  But, that stipulation fundamentally\n&gt; &gt; changes the nature of that debate, as without it, all things may\n&gt; &gt; not otherwise be considered equal unless we limit the discussion to\n&gt; &gt; non-Internet uses of HTTP.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, I (personally) think it would be most useful to add that\n&gt; constraint to the conversation and agree that it fundamentally\n&gt; changes the nature of the debate - well, think it&#39;s more than clear\n&gt; it does by now!\n&gt; \n\nThank you, that&#39;s pretty much all I needed to hear from anyone, to step\noff and shutup for a while.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; To perhaps hit media types &#39;only in REST-the-style&#39; then it would be\n&gt; my understanding that a shared understanding of the media type by all \n&gt; parties is needed, else the messages cannot be understood and the\n&gt; whole thing is pointless. How that understanding is formulated is not\n&gt; part of REST, however logic and practicalities would probably point\n&gt; us right back to a registry of media types and each one with a spec.\n&gt; \n\nThis point is exactly why I discuss Gopher.  The &#39;h&#39; identifier is\nwidely understood to mean HTML, but that understanding isn&#39;t defined\nanywhere but within the common, late-era client and server libraries.\nWhile Gopher is inherently unRESTful due to its lack of caching, it does\nrepresent a uniform interface with a network-based API -- right up\nuntil you use &#39;h&#39; and relegate yourself to a library-based API, by\nbreaking the self-descriptive messaging constraint.\n\nIOW, Gopher&#39;s lack of a registry illustrates exactly why we likely need\nsome sort of registry, for any protocol that separates resource from\nrepresentation, which is a basic requirement for instantiating REST.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
