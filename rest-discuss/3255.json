One-time or time-limited URIs seem to be \nconsistent with the former, but not the latter.\n\nREST also seems to favour the former interpretation, but, despite some \nheroic attempts by Walden Mathews to shed some light on the issue a few \nmonths back on this list, it&#39;s still unclear what RFC 2616 says about \nit, or even whether RFC 2616 is consistent (IMO, it equivocates between \nthe two interpretations).\n\nCheers,\n\n\nMiles\n\n"}}
