However, because of tro=\r\nubled web browser support and my personal preference for JSON over XML form=\r\nats, I started to think about JSON-based alternatives.\n\nThankfully, JavaScr=\r\nipt XHR requests allow the full range of HTTP methods.  So creating a JavaS=\r\ncript browser was certainly possible.  Now all that remained was adding an =\r\nultra-simple microformat to JSON that the JavaScript browser would understa=\r\nnd.\n\nAfter some evenings and weekends, I completed the hm-json (hypermedia =\r\nJSON) Browser.  I&#39;ve put it under the permissive MIT license so that anyone=\r\n can use it and modify it for their own project.  \n\nI particularly value an=\r\ny insights or comments from this group because I *think* this is a neat app=\r\nlication of the REST concept, but I&#39;m a little afraid to say so without mor=\r\ne feedback from &quot;serious REST people&quot;.\n\n\nHow it works:\n\nThe hm-json Browser=\r\n uses the OPTIONS HTTP method to request the hypermedia representation of a=\r\n resource at a URI.  It parses the server&#39;s response and displays it in a s=\r\nimple graphical menu containing the document&#39;s title, description, and list=\r\n of related links.  The links, in turn, may describe other methods availabl=\r\ne on *that* resource, or other related resources altogether such as parent =\r\nor child resources.\n\nThe links are composed of a URI, a rel(ated) property,=\r\n the HTTP method supported (such as GET, POST, OPTIONS, DELETE, PUT), and a=\r\nlso a title and description to display to a human user.  The browser turns =\r\nthese into clickable menu items which make the appropriate request to the s=\r\nerver.  Some links, such as PUT or POST (or templated URIs) will need some =\r\nadditional input, so the browser presents input fields for these as needed.=\r\n\n\nAs you can see, the whole thing is very simple.  But with just these few =\r\nproperties, the hm-json Browser allows anyone to start at a single entry UR=\r\nI anywhere in the API and browse their way through the rest of the API, dis=\r\ncovering all of the resources and methods available on the server (as permi=\r\nssions may dictate).  Thus, the API is completely self-documenting and requ=\r\nires absolutely no programming to use.\n\n\nNote:\n\nThis isn&#39;t just an aimless =\r\nexperiment.  The whole reason I started to seriously explore REST is becaus=\r\ne I&#39;m designing the API for a commercial web application (which is complete=\r\nd and live but currently has no client-facing API).  I&#39;m not embarrassed to=\r\n admit that I was drawn to the REST style because of the &quot;pretty URLs&quot;.  Bu=\r\nt as I learned more, the thing that really excited me about REST was the hy=\r\npermedia element.  And I was really surprised to find so few actual working=\r\n examples of that out in the wild.  \n\nI hate buzzwords and I am very aware =\r\nthat REST is often used as one.  Therefore, when our commercial product use=\r\ns this browser to expose the API to client developers, I want it to be a &quot;g=\r\nood example&quot; of REST, not yet another bad one.\n\n\nThanks in advance for any =\r\nfeedback you can give me.  Criticism welcome!\n\n-Dave Gauer\n\n\n"}}
