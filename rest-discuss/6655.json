Even now, it has so far\nonly been mentioned in reference to hyperlinks from one resource\nto other resources. But &quot;hypertext is the engine of application\nstate&quot; for PUT & POST (such as with forms) just as it is for GET\n(such as with links). The client need not guess the request method\nany more than it need guess the URL structure.\n\nElliotte said, &quot;PUT means create or modify at a client specified\nURL. POST means create or modify at a server specified URL.&quot; But I\nbelieve that even with PUT, it&#39;s still the server&#39;s responsibility\nto specify the URL. As far as I understand, the only semantic\ndifference between PUT and POST is simply that PUT is required to\nbe idempotent and POST is not. GET is both safe & idempotent; PUT\n& DELETE are idempotent but not safe; and POST is neither\nidempotent nor safe. If my desired state transfer is not\nidempotent, or if my tools (such as HTML forms) don&#39;t support PUT\n& DELETE, or if the operation doesn&#39;t really feel like putting or\ndeleting something, I&#39;ll go ahead and use POST. Otherwise, I&#39;ll\npick the one that feels most suggestive of the desired effect.\n\nCheers,\nJustin\n\n\nBenjamin Carlyle wrote:\n\n&gt; When moving from Object-Orientation to REST, it is important to\n&gt; fix your analogies to the right places. In REST, a URL is like a\n&gt; pointer or reference in Object-Orientation. You aren&#39;t meant to\n&gt; understand it. It isn&#39;t a tree, despite having structure. A\n&gt; smart person might be able interpret the just pointer and figure\n&gt; out some sort of relationship of this memory block to another,\n&gt; however it makes more sense to look at the pointers and\n&gt; references that exist within the memory rather than looking at\n&gt; the pointer itself.\n&gt;\n&gt; The same goes for REST. URLs are usually structured to avoid\n&gt; naming clashes and to make sense to the server owner. Human\n&gt; clients may be able to make use of this structure, but at the\n&gt; machine level the only real structure to a RESTful application\n&gt; is the graph of hyperlinks between resources. When you look at a\n&gt; fleet, you should be able see or navigate to the list of\n&gt; vehicles that form part of the fleet. That doesn&#39;t mean that the\n&gt; vehicles urls should include the fleet urls, in fact they\n&gt; definately shouldn&#39;t if the vehicle can ever change fleets. It\n&gt; is just a list.\n&gt;\n&gt; Part of the power of this decoupling is that I can maintain a\n&gt; list of vehicles that from part of my fleet without containing\n&gt; them on the same server, let alone within the same path\n&gt; structure. That means that I can write an application solely\n&gt; dedicated to fleet management, and have it simply refer off via\n&gt; hyperlinks to an appliation solely dedicated to vehicle\n&gt; management. By trying to interpret the urls themselves as\n&gt; structure you close yourself off to these kinds of important\n&gt; capabilities.\n&gt;\n&gt; Benjamin.\n\n"}}
