I&#39;d put &#39;live&#39; in quotes more so than &#39;dead&#39;.  ;)  In both\n&gt; cases, a copy of *something* is made.  In distributed object systems,\n&gt; great pains are taken to have this notion of &#39;live&#39; objects that have\n&gt; the same identity.  For a particular system that expense might be\n&gt; justified ... but it seems easier to me to think of separate things as\n&gt; separate.\n\nWhat I meant with live objects was data with behavior, i.e. the objects \nhave methods you can call which do things.\n\n&gt; Don&#39;t forget about the efficiency of a set of fine-grained operations\n&gt; vs. coarse-grained operations in the context of a high-latency network.\n&gt; Also, consider the differences in the deployment scenarios of a bounded\n&gt; intranet vs. a dynamic, intermediated topology such as the internet.\n\nYou mean that COM is normally more fine-grained? Or you mean that the \nfine-grainedness has a large impact no matter which architecture you&#39;re \nusing?\n\n&gt; REST can definitely be used in a resource-restricted environment ...\n&gt; consider an HTTP request to a server from a cell phone,\n&gt; content-negotiating a more appropriate representation of the homepage of\n&gt; a website.  Or that request being transparently proxied through a\n&gt; transcoder that downsamples images to better suit the\n&gt; resource-constrained device.\n\nI was thinking more of where you have both the server and client on the \nsame device. But I agree that it&#39;s possible, I&#39;m just wondering if COM \nor REST is better suited (or maybe there&#39;s no way to tell on a general \nlevel).\n\n&gt; Maybe it&#39;s possible to put a &quot;REST-like&quot; layer on top of a COM solution\n&gt; and vice-versa.   But it&#39;s always going to be a case of the solution not\n&gt; really making full/appropriate use of the substrate protocol, treating\n&gt; it as a transport layer.\n\nAfter thinking a bit more about it I agree with you.\n\nCheers,\n  Jonas\n\n\n\n\n"}}
