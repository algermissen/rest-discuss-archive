I said some of them have, \n&gt; which is what you say; the rest didn=92t=\r\n care. They (or at \n&gt; least, a significant portion of them) would have move=\r\nd, had \n&gt; there been any tangible payoff =96 had XHTML offered features \n&gt; =\r\nthat they didn=92t already have. But it doesn=92t; only \n&gt; programmers with=\r\n XML tools at their disposal had a reason to \n&gt; move, whereas everyone else=\r\n had lots of reason not to.\n\nI&#39;ll agree that XHTML minmally needed to offer=\r\n features they did not already\nhave but I&#39;d say it is an untestable conclus=\r\nion that people would have moved\nhad it had more features.  We can&#39;t know w=\r\nhat effect XHTML&#39;s strictness\nwould have had on uptake, which I believe wou=\r\nld have had a significant\ndamping effect.  But even my conclusion is untest=\r\nable, so we might as well\nagree to be confined to our own opinions on this =\r\none.\n\n&gt; &gt; And I&#39;ll argue that having the browser support it strictly (and \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; strictness is what I&#39;m arguing against) would have resulting in too \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; many people seeing the web as broken which an important contingent \n&gt; &gt; (=\r\nthat mainly includes Microsoft) simply won&#39;t let that happen.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think =\r\nMSFT of all entities would be more than happy to let \n&gt; the web appear brok=\r\nen. If you think the web is broken, \n&gt; Redmond has a Silverlight engine to =\r\nsell you=85\n\nHeh.  You weren&#39;t in the 1.5 hour meeting I had with Chris Wil=\r\nson where I\nbegged him to consider certain features for HTML5 where his rep=\r\neated refrain\nto me was: &quot;No can do. It will cause the web to break for a s=\r\negment of users\nand if it even affects as many as 0.1% of users then it=92s=\r\n a non-starter\nbecause 0.1% of users would represent such a large number of=\r\n actual users.&quot;\n\n\nNo, I think &#39;Microsoft&#39; *really* wants to ensure the web =\r\ndoesn&#39;t break, to a\nfault.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (Of course, just because you&#39;re using XML=\r\n doesn&#39;t \n&gt; automatically mean \n&gt; &gt; &gt; you&#39;ll end up with a well thought-out=\r\n vocabulary. Most \n&gt; ad-hoc vocabs \n&gt; &gt; &gt; are mediocre or worse. That&#39;s har=\r\ndly XML&#39;s fault.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Is that the &quot;Guns don&#39;t kill people, people do&quot; =\r\nargument?\n&gt; \n&gt; Well just because you use JSON doesn=92t mean you=92ll end u=\r\np \n&gt; with a well-designed data structure either. Too little or too \n&gt; much =\r\nnesting, extensibility provisions and the like are all \n&gt; concerns you=92ll=\r\n have to deal with. \n\nGranted.\n\n&gt; All of the data formats are just tools, a=\r\nnd how well they=92re \n&gt; used inescapably depends on the one who wields the=\r\nm.\n\nThat makes the assumption that all tools are equally capable and that a=\r\nll\ntools equally address all requirements, which clearly isn=92t true. Each=\r\n tool\nworks best in its optimized context and in the case of JSON vs. XML t=\r\nhe\nformer works better in part because it doesn&#39;t present as many options o=\r\nne\nhas to deal with.  Dereferncing a Javascript object is much more consist=\r\nent\nthan accessing data in the DOM or via Xpath. \n\n&gt; &gt; Quoting Dare Obasanj=\r\no:\n&gt; &gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n&gt; &gt; You XML folks completely miss the point. JSON=\r\n is important \n&gt; because it \n&gt; &gt; is better supported in the browser than XM=\r\nL. That&#39;s why it \n&gt; has taken \n&gt; &gt; hold. Arguing that angle brackets, S-exp=\r\nressions and JSON \n&gt; syntax are \n&gt; &gt; all semantically equivalent is the hei=\r\nght of architecture \n&gt; &gt; astronautics[0] and COMPLETELY misses the point.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Dare conveniently overlooks that it=92s the JSON proponents \n&gt; themselv=\r\nes who tout syntactic brevity as a major win for JSON.\n\nNo, Dare addresses =\r\nthat saying JSON proponents who tout syntax are\novershadowing what he belie=\r\nves to be more significant benefits of JSON.\nFYI, I think they are equally =\r\nsignificant.\n\n&gt; &gt; Quoting Masklinn:\n&gt; &gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n&gt; &gt; Wow. David, =\r\nhave you at no point considered refactoring \n&gt; your Lisp and \n&gt; &gt; JSON mark=\r\nups? They&#39;re horrible, you&#39;re piling crap on crap it&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; idiotic.\n&gt; \n&gt; Y=\r\neah, mixed content is inconvenient and alien if you=92re a \n&gt; programmer an=\r\nd all the world=92s a data structure=85 in which \n&gt; case it=92s not surpris=\r\ning that you think trying to map out a \n&gt; mixed content model in data struc=\r\ntures is crap piled on crap \n&gt; and looks idiotic.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course if the dat=\r\na is rigidly structured, it *is* idiotic=85\n\nSorry, after re-reading that t=\r\nhree times I still have totally no idea what\npoint you were trying to make.=\r\n..\n\n&gt; &gt; Quoting rektide:\n&gt; &gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n&gt; &gt; the DOM data structure =\r\nused by XML is immensely frustrating to deal \n&gt; &gt; with. multiple text node =\r\nchildren hanging off elements, content \n&gt; &gt; validation before you can .Inne=\r\nrText, theres just a never ending \n&gt; &gt; rigamaroll to do what is ultimately =\r\na very very simple \n&gt; task, and i for \n&gt; &gt; one do not enjoy writing such ve=\r\nrbose kludgtastic code. the data \n&gt; &gt; structures built by xml tooling just =\r\nsuck horrendous ass.\n&gt; \n&gt; So use XPath. DOM blows chunks and a bunch of oth=\r\ner things.\n\nXPath still has ideosyncracies that Javascript objects just don=\r\n&#39;t have.\n\n&gt; &gt; But I think his point is that all the formats have benefits a=\r\nnd XML \n&gt; &gt; may have some benefits as complexities grow which I won&#39;t debat=\r\ne.\n&gt; \n&gt; As I said, if you have a rigid data structure, XML isn=92t a \n&gt; goo=\r\nd fit. \n\nFunny, I think that is the only place where it is a reasonably goo=\r\nd fit.\n\n&gt; (And lord almighty did people get \n&gt; obsessed with replacing perf=\r\nectly good CSV interfaces with XML.)\n\nFrankly, I&#39;ve always hated CSV; I&#39;ll =\r\ntake XML over CSV anyday. The only\nreasonably reliable &#39;CSV&#39; was tab-delimi=\r\nted and tabs are too easy to munge\nin a text editors.  With quotes and comm=\r\nas, having a comma or a quote in\nyour data totally whacks the file. I only =\r\nwish that Excel has come up with a\nbetter solution than CSV.\n\n&gt; If you have=\r\n regular tabular data, even JSON is a \n&gt; lesser choice than CSV. \n\nHow so? =\r\n If I serve CSV to AJAX I have to write a CSV parser, and there&#39;s\nthe quote=\r\ns and commas problem.  If I trust the server all I have to do with\nJSON is =\r\neval().\n \n\n&gt; I=92m certainly not one to champion XML =FCber alles. (Look ba=\r\nck \n&gt; in the list=92s archives a while ago =96 the Megginson post I \n&gt; link=\r\ned to was a reaction to a blog spat that Eliotte Rusty \n&gt; Harold more or le=\r\nss started by carrying an argument over to \n&gt; his weblog that started on th=\r\nis list where it was mainly \n&gt; between me and him. In which I was in the ro=\r\nle of JSON defender=85)\n\nYeah, but it&#39;s easy to get into an argument with E=\r\nRH... :-0\n\n&gt; &gt; OTOH, I like to minimize complexity in web services as much =\r\nas \n&gt; &gt; possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; Things should be made as simple as possible, but no =\r\nsimpler.\n\nHence why I said &quot;as much as *possible*.&quot; ;-)\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel=\r\n\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://=\r\natlanta-web.org \n\n\n"}}
