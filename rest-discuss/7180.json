I implemented software for an international scale seismic data\n&gt; distribution network.  The only thing that resembled that sort of\n&gt; &quot;choreography&quot; was the discovery process for new hubs/stations (data\n&gt; sinks and sources); all data included an http URI up front which\n&gt; identified the source.  A GET on that would return an RDF/XML document\n&gt; describing the capabilities of the service, the available data\n&gt; channels, and the data collection services and what data they\n&gt; accepted, etc.. (using RDF Forms)  Then the discoverer could GET the\n&gt; data it wanted, submit its own data for processing, and submit (POST)\n&gt; its own document describing its capabilities and/or those of other\n&gt; services it had previously discovered.\n\nFascinating! Were the RDF/XML documents interpreted and further\ninteraction decisions made by computer programs or humans or a\ncombination of both?\n\n"}}
