What are the semantics of the missing elements?\n: &gt;\n: &gt; My argument --- cribbing earlier arguments with wiser folks than myself\n: &gt; --- is that if partial representations are excepted, e.g. if\n: &gt; /Users/joebob can take a form just containing elements id and ssn, that\n: &gt; you&#39;re in effect not doing literal REpresentational State Transfer --- \n: &gt; rather you&#39;re selectively invoking one of a set of polymorphic methods\n: &gt; named POST where the size of the set is determined by the total number\n: &gt; of permutations of required and optional elements, with dispatch being\n: &gt; done by hand over that space.  Worse, some permutations may be legal\n: &gt; and unamiguous, while other may be illegal, while others may be legal\n: &gt; but ambiguous.  Ugh.  In doing this, you&#39;ve in effect undermined the\n: &gt; compositional complexity benefit (the O(n) vs. O(n^2) argument) of\n: &gt; RESTlike systems.  Not to mention made the dispatcher / validator&#39;s job\n: &gt; combinatorially harder.\n:\n: As you suggest, the same issue comes up with XML schemas.  Presumably,\n: the first thing that the server does with POST&#39;ed XML is run it through\n: a validator, so that you can keep manual validation coding to a minimum.\n:   However, if the schema allows missing or blank elements in order to\n: support these partial updates, a large chunk of the benefit of\n: validation goes out the window.\n:\n: I think the thing to do is choose a limited set of the most common\n: updates that are logical and legal for your application.  Represent\n: those updates with unique XML records that have their own schema.  For\n: example, to update the user&#39;s name:\n:\n: POST /Users/&lt;user&gt; HTTP/1.1\n:\n: &lt;UserNameUpdate&gt;\n:      &lt;firstName&gt;...&lt;/firstName&gt;\n:      &lt;lastName&gt;...&lt;/lastName&gt;\n: &lt;/UserNameUpdate&gt;\n:\n:\n: I don&#39;t think this is the best example, but I&#39;m working from what you\n: gave me.  In reality the user record would be more complex, and you&#39;d\n: probably group all the contact information into a single update.  In\n: other words, updates wouldn&#39;t be at such a fine grain.\n:\n: -John\n:\n:\n: -- \n: http:// ift ile.org/\n:\n:\n:\n:\n: Yahoo!
