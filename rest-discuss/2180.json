In his article, Paul makes that now standard comparison \nof HTTP&#39;s GET/PUT/POST/DELETE with SQL&#39;s SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE. \n At some level, this is probably a reasonable comparison to make. \nUnfortunately, I think a lot of people people take that high level \nanalogy and then try to do a one-to-one mapping between the methods of \nthe two schemes - something that for me ended up being very misleading.\n\nAs far as HTTP&#39;s GET and DELETE mapping to SQL&#39;s SELECT and DELETE - I \ndon&#39;t see there being any problem.  However, trying to do a one-to-one \nmapping of PUT to INSERT or POST to UPDATE doesnt work so well.  PUT \nactually maps to either INSERT or UPDATE depending on whether the target \nresource already exists. POST maps to either INSERT or UPDATE depending \non whether or not the resource you&#39;re POSTing to is a container (using \nMark&#39;s model of HTTP resource state [2],[3]).\n\nSo, realizing my mistake, I now have a model of RESTful use of HTTP \nmethods that&#39;s something like this:\n\nGET - retrieve (a representation of) the resource&#39;s state\nPUT - directly set the resource&#39;s state\nPOST - indirectly change the resource&#39;s state\nDELETE - delete the resource\n\nIt seems to me, then, that the difference between PUT and POST is in \npart related to whether or not you are directly manipulating a \nresource&#39;s state.  With PUT, you are directly setting the resource&#39;s \nstate by explicitly providing a representation of the resource&#39;s \n(entire) new state.  \n\nWith POST, you can only indirectly change the resource&#39;s state by \nproviding a representation of something that the resource will then use \nin a manner of its choosing to change its own state.  In other words, \nyou dont directly or explicitly specify the resource&#39;s new state - you \njust provide the resource with some information and it decides how to \nchange its state based on that new information.\n\nI think this is more or less just a restatement of what Mark has said in \n[2] and [3].  I&#39;m just suggesting that maybe some of us have trouble \nunderstanding the difference between PUT and POST because we&#39;ve made too \nliteral an association between HTTP&#39;s methods and the methods of SQL or \nCRUD.  Yes, both HTTP and SQL can do CRUD.  But, unlike SQL, HTTP&#39;s \nmethods do not have a one-to-one mapping to CRUD&#39;s create, read, update \nand delete.\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n[1] http://www.sys-con.com/xml/article.cfm?id=454\n[2] http://www.markbaker.ca/2001/09/draft-baker-http-resource-state-model\n[3] http://www.markbaker.ca/2002/08/HowContainersWork/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
