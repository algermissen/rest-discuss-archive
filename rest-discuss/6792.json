These are obviously metaphors for some kind\nof coordination.  Like &quot;Service Oriented Architecture&quot; they\nseem hard to pin down, because different authors\nhave different ideas of what they mean.\n\nFor example, http://www.middlewarespectra.com/abstracts/2003_08_03.htm :\n\n&quot;In an ideal world, business professionals and managers will be able to \nspecify these reactions and responses themselves, without having to bring \nprogrammers into the picture. This ambition has come to be known as \n&#39;orchestration&#39; or &#39;choreography&#39;: the analogy with the way in which skilled \nmusicians and dancers co-ordinate their actions while carrying out \npredetermined instructions is entirely deliberate. The possibilities are \nentrancing... but at this very moment new difficulties appear.&quot;\n\nAbove, the author treats the two terms as synonymous.  But here:\n\nhttp://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/qna/0,289202,sid26_gci1066118,00.html\n\n&quot;Choreography is completely complementary to that [orchestration]. WS-CDL is \nan unambiguous way of describing the relationships between the services in a \npeer-to-peer collaboration without necessitating any orchestration at all. \nThat&#39;s very important because if my business and your business are talking \ntogether, I can guarantee you that neither of us would accept orchestrating \nthe other&#39;s services.&quot;\n\nThis author seems to have made a (somewhat arbitrary, IMO) distinction \nbetween\nthe two.\n\nSo I think if you really want to get an answer to your question, you might\nwant to drag a real use case in here and see how the REST style treats it. \nI surmise\nwe would then soon be talking about &quot;hypertext as the engine of application\nstate&quot;, but let&#39;s see...\n\nWalden\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Stelios Eliakis&quot; &lt;eliakis@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, November 09, 2006 8:50 AM\nSubject: [rest-discuss] orchestration - choreography\n\n\n: Hi,\n: I was talking with a colleague about web services and orchestration -\n: choreography.\n: He told me that with rest you cannot orchestrate your web services.\n: Is it wrong?\n:\n: Can you give me any resources or explain me the way that someone could\n: orchestrate his web services with REST?\n:\n: -- \n: Stelios Eliakis\n:\n:\n: __________ NOD32 1.1859 (20061108) Information __________\n:\n: This message was checked by NOD32 antivirus system.\n: http://www.eset.com\n:\n: \n\n\n"}}
