We are currently using the If-Modified-Since header along with\n&gt; 304 &quot;Not Modified&quot; response codes to ensure that the device does not\n&gt; download the file more than is absolutely necessary, but I&#39;d like to\n&gt; go a step further and only provide the changed records to the device\n&gt; (this is an XML file FWIW). After combing over the HTTP spec and not\n&gt; finding much on Google I think this might be a valid approach:\n&gt;\n&gt; Client sends a GET request with an If-Range header that specifies the\n&gt; last download date and a Range header that specifies the same. The\n&gt; server could then send back a response of 304 &quot;Not Modified&quot;, 206\n&gt; &quot;Partial Resource&quot; along with the deltas as the body or a 200 with all\n&gt; of the records as the body.\n\nI think there might be some confusion as to what I was trying to do.\nThe &quot;resource&quot; in question here is a web service that knows how to\nparse headers and query a database to return only the records since\nthe last modified date submitted by the device, the client contains\nthe logic to take a partial XML file (partial in the sense of does not\ncontain all records) and merge it into it&#39;s locally cached copy. With\nthat in mind the patch approach doesn&#39;t work as well and canonical XML\nis a little overkill for this project.\n\nAfter re-reading the header portion of the HTTP spec it would seem\nperfectly legitimate for me to send back a 206 response to a GET\nrequest that contains an If-Modified-Since header. The body of that\nreply would be the changed records since the last time the client\ndownloaded the resource.\n\n-mike\n\n\n-- \n________________________________\nMichael E.
