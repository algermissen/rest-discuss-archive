I share most of Antonio&#39;s fe=\r\nelings in his rant. Sometimes I do not agree on his appreciations, but the =\r\npoints he made are valid. Actually, there are point I see on other threads =\r\nas well.\n\n2. REST, as I understand, is a style. You can build it with whate=\r\nver you want. We need to apply the &quot;practicality&quot; principle (do things in a=\r\n practical way) and avoid the Golden Hammer Syndrome. \n\n3. To me, Standardi=\r\nzation is more related to common understanding, of all participants in a ne=\r\ntworked application. The registering part is a way of doing it. There me be=\r\n better or worse ways, all accomplishing the same goal.\n\n4. REST is free to=\r\n be used privately, or so I feel it. Only a few guys and me. There is nothi=\r\nng I can find that forces me to use the WEB in general and to take into acc=\r\nount all and each of the nodes that are connected to it. \n\n5. Not all is wr=\r\nitten, yet. It is not true the current &quot;standards&quot;, official or ad hoc, are=\r\n the only ones that will ever be, no new kids allowed.\n\n6. If I use the web=\r\n, doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m entering the big and only one networked application, tha=\r\nt I should agree with all the existing nodes in the web the way I send my m=\r\nessages (and the ones that will be in the future too!). And here (as with e=\r\nverything else) I can be wrong: I see the web more as a framework, a suppor=\r\nting implementation for trillions of networked, individual apps. There I ca=\r\nn use others services, create my own, be a global provider or simply build =\r\na small page for my family to see mi baby&#39;s pictures. I see no practical us=\r\ne to have a full body of standards watching over me and punishing if I post=\r\n the pictures using my own, non-patent, 4D format. I see practical use in h=\r\naving that body registering the common, most used, most practical, proven a=\r\nnd approved format we can use, so if I&#39;m new in town, I can go there and pi=\r\nck the best for my app, if that one exists. And the best means the one that=\r\n will support many of my quality properties needs, which MAY be: interopera=\r\nbility, readiness, compactness, legibility, security, etc. \n\n7. Example? We=\r\n work on a testing system that builds thousands of nodes, for a few minutes=\r\n, to load test servers. That is a network of testing nodes, on the cloud, t=\r\nalking between them with proprietary, efficient formats. Once all that info=\r\n is gathered, it is served in standard formats to clients. That is practica=\r\nl. RESTful? May be, but who cares? It is working and working fine.\n\nCheers!=\r\n\n\nWilliam Martinez.   \n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, mike amundsen =\r\n&lt;mamund@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ant=F3nio:\n&gt; \n&gt; Not sure if this is exactly where y=\r\nou are heading, but here my POV:\n&gt; \n&gt; REST style is protocol-agnostic (not =\r\nlimited to HTTP)\n&gt; REST style is not limited to Web or Internet usage (e. g=\r\n. has\n&gt; application for communication between autonomous devices in a close=\r\nd\n&gt; custom network)\n&gt; REST style using HTTP over the Web is not limited to =\r\nusing the common\n&gt; Browser for the &quot;client&quot; (e. g. desktop applications. co=\r\nnsole apps,\n&gt; bots, etc.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, the REST style is not the only inte=\r\nresting style for building\n&gt; distributed network applications.\n&gt; \n&gt; mca\n&gt; h=\r\nttp://amundsen.com/blog/\n&gt; http://mamund.com/foaf#me\n&gt; \n&gt; Join me at #RESTF=\r\nest 2010 Sep 17 & 18\n&gt; http://restfest.org\n&gt; http://restfest.org/workshop\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; ---------- Forwarded message ----------\n&gt; From: Ant=F3nio Mota &lt;amsmota=\r\n@...&gt;\n&gt; Date: 2010/8/12\n&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] Atom feed vs. list of=\r\n orders\n&gt; To: &quot;Eric J.

Or it should, or it\n&gt; can, be applied to the more =\r\ngeneral space of network-based software\n&gt; architectures, thus including int=\r\nranets (network based apps that runs\n&gt; exclusively inside a company) and ex=\r\ntranets (the use of private\n&gt; networks and/or the public infrastructure of =\r\nthe internet to connect a\n&gt; limited number of companies - considering limit=\r\ned does not equal\n&gt; small)?\n&gt; \n&gt; Because if it is indeed only applicable to=\r\n the Web - and please note\n&gt; that Web !=3D Internet - to making websites th=\r\nat are going to be used by\n&gt; humans using a browser, most of the discussion=\r\ns here don&#39;t really make\n&gt; sense. Otherwise, some people assumptions when t=\r\nhey deal with the\n&gt; issues presented on this list are, to say the least, li=\r\nmited. Or plain\n&gt; wrong, not to say the least. Now I do understand that one=\r\n or the other\n&gt; approach may have to do with each one background, people wh=\r\no&#39;s work is\n&gt; limited to the web may have a different point of view than ot=\r\nhers who\n&gt; worked over several areas and platforms along the years.\n&gt; \n&gt; Fo=\r\nr instance, what is the sense in saying &quot;Media type identifers\n&gt; inform cli=\r\nents what codec or engine to use for deciphering the\n&gt; payload&quot; if my clien=\r\nts are *not* browsers? And also please someone\n&gt; correct if I&#39;m wrong by sa=\r\nying &quot;ubiquitous&quot; !=3D &quot;standard&quot;...\n&gt; \n&gt; While it is true that intermediar=\r\nies don&#39;t look inside the msg to\n&gt; perform their function, why is that true=\r\n also for servers that are not\n&gt; web-servers? If I have a application/mystu=\r\nff+xml, all the\n&gt; intermediaries understand what they need to understand - =\r\nthey read\n&gt; this as application/xml. Why should the server be limited to th=\r\nis,\n&gt; knowing that I, as a architect/designer, although I =A0*do not* have\n=\r\n&gt; control on intermediaries I *do* have control over the server? The\n&gt; coup=\r\nling using application/xml or application/mystuff+xml is, from\n&gt; this point=\r\n of view, exactly the same. And I do see advantage of using\n&gt; &quot;application/=\r\nmystuff+xml&quot; on content-negociation *on the server side*,\n&gt; because like th=\r\nat I can even put that content-negociation on my\n&gt; *server-side connector* =\r\n- which I also control, thus relieving the\n&gt; server from workload, improvin=\r\ng balancing, implementing scalability\n&gt; and effectively implementing layere=\r\nd design - but of course all this\n&gt; is just impelementation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, and=\r\n all please excuse my rant but these things must be said...\n&gt; why some peop=\r\nle on this list insist in treating people sometimes like\n&gt; morons and somet=\r\nimes like little kids in the classroom in front of the\n&gt; master? Shouldn&#39;t =\r\nwe all consider the others as pairs, even if the\n&gt; knowledge of some are su=\r\nperior to the one of others? Aren&#39;t we all\n&gt; professionals? What&#39;s the &quot;you=\r\n kids&quot;? I&#39;m trying not to say harsh\n&gt; words, but do I have to publicize tha=\r\nt I develop software for the past\n&gt; 30 years, 27 of then as a professional,=\r\n 20 of then as a independent\n&gt; consultant / contractor? That I started to d=\r\no web sites since the\n&gt; earlier 90&#39;s and I kept working on the web (althoug=\r\nh not exclusively)\n&gt; until as recently as 2007, when I designed and impleme=\r\nnted a web-site\n&gt; login method using telephony - where you had to call a nu=\r\nmber to be\n&gt; authorized to enter the site and you will be logged in until y=\r\nou hang\n&gt; up the call. Should I also say that I did a web site to a chicken=\r\n\n&gt; delivery service - I didn&#39;t put that on my CV since I made it to a\n&gt; fri=\r\nend and it was not a paid job - or actually it was, I got paid in\n&gt; chicken=\r\ns... I even designed myself many animated gif&#39;s... How&#39;s that\n&gt; for publici=\r\nty? I don&#39;t know, maybe it&#39;s just me that dislike being\n&gt; treated with this=\r\n kind of disdain?\n&gt; \n&gt; Nevertheless, I really think that this list should c=\r\nlarify the\n&gt; question I talked above, because frankly if REST is only about=\r\n the\n&gt; web, I am plain wrong in my approach and it is better for me to\n&gt; un=\r\nderstand that now and move on to other technologies. And I think\n&gt; others w=\r\nill benefit from that clarification also.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On 12 August 2010 07:1=\r\n9, Eric J.
