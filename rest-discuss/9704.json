E.g.,:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://example.co=\r\nm/search?query=3Datom+or+rss+syndication&type=3Darticle &#92;\n&gt; &collection=3Dm=\r\ny_collection&collection=3Dyour_collection&start=3D10&max=3D40\n&gt;\n&gt; I take th=\r\nat url string and &quot;normalize&quot; it (lower-case all query terms,\n&gt; alphabetize=\r\n multiple params, etc) into a data structure such that all\n&gt; equivalent sea=\r\nrches will result in the exact same data structure (NOTE\n&gt; that &#39;start&#39; and=\r\n &#39;max&#39; are NOT included in the data structure). I\n&gt; then get the md5 hash o=\r\nf the string representation of that data\n&gt; structure -- this will serve as =\r\na key to a cache of searches. I then\n&gt; derive an sql statement from the dat=\r\na structure and perform the\n&gt; search. The result of the search is simply a =\r\nset of ordered ID\n&gt; numbers for all of the items that match the search. I t=\r\nake that\n&gt; entire id number string and cache it, with the search md5 hash a=\r\ns the\n&gt; key. Next, I apply the &quot;start&quot; and &quot;max&quot; parameters to this string,=\r\n\n&gt; resulting in my viewable set of items,. which I load up (i.e., grab\n&gt; al=\r\nl of the data for these items) and send back in the response. Note\n&gt; that t=\r\nhe original search query is &quot;bookmark-able&quot; and will always\n&gt; return the sa=\r\nme response.\n&gt;\n&gt; Embedded in the response are links to the &quot;previous&quot; and &quot;=\r\nnext&quot; set of\n&gt; items (computed based on the &quot;start&quot; and &quot;max&quot; params of the=\r\n original\n&gt; request). BUT, instead of embedding that entire query string, I=\r\n can\n&gt; simply embed a URL like:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://example.com/search_hash/56YYYufg=\r\nsfggfccFF098?start=3D50&max=3D40\n&gt;\n&gt; for the &quot;next&quot; link.\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, I appea=\r\nr to have used a GET request to create a new resource in\n&gt; the search_hash =\r\nresource &#39;collection&#39;, which I now refer to in the\n&gt; resulting hypertext of=\r\n that new search. Should the original query\n&gt; have used POST instead of GET=\r\n? (That seems wrong somehow, and in the\n&gt; case of repeat searches it WON&#39;T =\r\ncreate a new resource, but using GET\n&gt; is CLEARLY resulting in a &#39;side effe=\r\nct&#39;, which in not allowed).\n&gt;\n&gt; any advice/observations on this?\n&gt;\n&gt; many t=\r\nhanks-\n&gt; Peter Keane\n&gt; daseproject.org\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
