I&#39;ve liked it so far because\n&gt;  &gt; it doesn&#39;t get in the way with how you want to design your\n&gt;  &gt; resources. Its just a simple bridge between the HTTP message and\n&gt;  &gt; your Java code.\n&gt; \n&gt; Primarily that it has a misleading name, or at least fails to deliver\n&gt; on that name.\n\nYou guys worry way to much about the semantics of a name.  Naming it \nJAX-RS sets a direction. Starts developers on the path to exploring and \ninvestigating RESTful design.  You need to understand that Java \ndevelopers are ingrained in the RPC world.  JAX-RS sets an initial \ndirection for the Java community without trying to do too much too soon.\n\n&gt; It should have been called &quot;Java API for interfacing to\n&gt; Web servers that&#39;s a bit nicer than servlets, and by the way why on\n&gt; Earth did the servlet designers not use the bloody return value anyway?&quot;\n&gt; \n\nNot really.  It does focus the developer a tiny bit more into thinking \nof representations.  It also doesn&#39;t allow the developer to dispatch \nbased on a query parameter.\n\n&gt; Obviously the bit after the comma is more artistic, and the\n&gt; appropriate JCP could choose to adopt it or not as it sees fit.\n&gt; \n&gt; Which resonates with something Mark Baker said the other day, that\n&gt; REST-* should have been called HTTP-*.\n\nYup, the initial submissions to REST-* were RPCish, I&#39;ve already \nadmitted to that.  I think the 2nd draft of messaging I posted late last \nnight is a bit more RESTful.  I&#39;m confident with some constructive input \nit will become more restful as it progresses.  I&#39;m working resubmitting \na restful interface for transactions as well.  When Mark Little first \nintroduced me to the tx api, I thought it could be greatly improved by \ndefining a set of link relationships and making URLs more opaque (Yes, \nI&#39;m repeating myself.).\n\n&gt; Like REST-*, JAX-RS is all\n&gt; about HTTP, not really about REST. After all, if we consider JAX-RS to\n&gt; be a framework for RESTful services, then we should also apply that\n&gt; moniker to servlets, no?\n&gt; \n\nYup.  In my JAX-RS talk I do state that there&#39;s no reason you can&#39;t use \nservlets to implement RESTful web services.\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
