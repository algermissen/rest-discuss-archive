This is\nHTTP we&#39;re talking about here.  How many different web servers do we\nhave nowadays?  App servers? Servlet containers?  Maybe I haven&#39;t been\npaying attention, but I didn&#39;t realize there were any major\ninteroperability issues between them - my browser seems to work with\njust about all of them with no problems.  Why would having multiple\nREST frameworks cause interoperability issues?  It&#39;s not like the HTTP\ncoming in and out of a RESTful framework is going to be any different\nthan the HTTP going in and out of a servlet engine - the headers and\nverbs have the same meaning regardless of what generates them.\n\nI say bring on the frameworks.  Each will have its own approach for\nfacilitating RESTful development - some will use annotations, some\nwill let you use URI-templating, others will make it easy to map\ndatabase records to resources; I&#39;ll pick the one I use based on the\nneeds of my current project.  If it turns out that the framework I&#39;m\nusing doesnt suit my needs, at least I&#39;ll have some options.\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n\nOn 2/26/07, Mike Schinkel &lt;mikeschinkel@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Elliotte Harold wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Mike Schinkel wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; How is this an improvement over RESTlet[1]?

Only by trying a lot of different things\n&gt; &gt; can we see what works.\n&gt;\n&gt; Variety for variety&#39;s sake is NOT good, IMO.

I can only see how it can\n&gt; harm it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Don&#39;t get me wrong; I&#39;m not saying there can be only one (unless you are an\n&gt; immortal, but I digress...)  What I am saying is that a bunch of\n&gt; implementations whose difference are based purely on arbitrary happenstance\n&gt; is nothing more than ego-gratification for the developers and not at all\n&gt; good for evolving interoperable solutions.\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; -Mike Schinkel\n&gt; http://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\n&gt; http://www.welldesignedurls.org\n&gt; http://atlanta-web.org - http://t.oolicio.us\n&gt; &quot;It never ceases to amaze how many people will proactively debate away\n&gt; attempts to improve the web...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
