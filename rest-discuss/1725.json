During a deep wreck dive, I think I achieved Zen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on REST and methods.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; And I thought *I* was obsessed.\n&gt;\n&gt; My gestalt happened in the shower...  That&#39;s a whole lot more mundane;\n&gt; Phil, I&#39;m envious. ;-) :-)\n\nGlad to be back on the list!  To combine my &quot;method Zen&quot; with the security\ndiscussion and Mike&#39;s comments about the role (pun intended) of subscriptions,\nhere is a contrast that I find interesting:\n\nOld Way (DCE RPC, ONC RPC, EZ-RPC, Microsoft RPC, CORBA, DCOM, RMI, XML-RPC,\nSOAP, etc):\n\n1. Remote message to a server requesting subcription to a topic\n2. Remote response by server indicating the results\n3. Remote message to server indicating update to topic by a publisher\n   client(s)\n4. Remote server sends (or multicasts) an update to each remote\n   subscriber\n5. Remote message to server requesting any or all of the topic&#39;s\n   contents\n\nNew Way (REST, WebDAV?, etc):\n\n1. Subscriber client creates subordinate representation (r1) of a\n   subscription\n2. HTTP POST of r1 to the remote topic&#39;s Subscriptions-URI resource,\n   including a Subscriber-URI entity field if the client desires\n   real-time event notifications\n3. Publisher client creates subordinate representation (r2) of an\n   update relative to the topic&#39;s watched content resource\n4. HTTP POST of r2 to the remote topic&#39;s Watched-URI resource\n5. Server translates and/or forwards r2 via HTTP PUT to each\n   subscriber client&#39;s Subscriber-URI resource\n6. HTTP GET to the remote topic&#39;s Watched-URI resource to fetch any\n   or all of the topic&#39;s contents\n\nNotice the common theme is that old method invocations are remote, and new\ninvocations are local.  For REST, invocations don&#39;t happen over the network at\nthe &quot;application-semantic&quot; level, unless it&#39;s GET, PUT, POST, or DELETE.\n\nWhether the data requested in old #5 or new #6 is fetched remotely may depend on\nfeatures like: throttles, caching rules, filtering ACL policies, existence of\nproxies, etc.  With the old method, it seems that snapping in these features\nwould become dismally over-complicated.  Since the new method does all method\ninvocations locally, the semantics of these features sit at the HTTP level,\nwhich is a very RESTful and *much* simpler approach.\n\nAdditional, detailed differences between the two approaches could take up\nseveral pages.  Comments/thoughts on the contrast?  Should we post something\nmore polished like it on RESTwiki?\n\n-Philip\n\n\n"}}
