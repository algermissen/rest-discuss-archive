Such mes=\r\nsages\nstill benefit from a more than significant proportion of existing Web=\r\n\ninfrastructure such as client and server libraries, as well as the\nbest ex=\r\nample of intermediate processing of self-descriptive messages;\n_caching_.\n\n=\r\n&gt; REST doesn&#39;t _require_ an HTTP response message\n&gt; with a payload (or not,=\r\n considering HEAD) to have _any_ response headers\n&gt; besides Status, Content=\r\n-Type, and one or the other of Content-Length or\n&gt; &#39;Transfer-Coding: chunke=\r\nd&#39;.\n\nReally? Caching is a REST constraint. It is a form of layering that\nre=\r\nlies on self-descriptiveness of messages.\n\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding=\r\n/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_1_4\n\n&quot;Cache constraints requir=\r\ne that the data within a response to a\nrequest be implicitly or explicitly =\r\nlabeled as cacheable or\nnon-cacheable&quot;\n\nA lack of cache-control headers is =\r\nan implicit form of\nself-descriptiveness, and fulfills a fundamental REST c=\r\nonstraint. So\nit is quite important, actually.\n\n&gt; Gopher also supports self=\r\n-descriptive messaging by using media type\n&gt; identifiers. =A0This holds tru=\r\ne for *any* protocol that has a concept of\n&gt; resource vs. representation. =\r\n=A0If the server doesn&#39;t specify a\n&gt; processing model, the entity is *meani=\r\nngless* no matter how much other\n&gt; control data is present, unless clients =\r\nand intermediaries resort to\n&gt; introspection -- which clearly violates REST=\r\n.\n\nNo.. the server *can* specify a processing model - by specifying a\ncusto=\r\nm type identifier (i.e. non-IANA-registered) in the Content-Type\nheader.\n\nW=\r\nhy should an intermediary like a cache or a reverse proxy router need\nto in=\r\ntrospect the entity at all?\n\nWhat are these illusive, yet apparently invalu=\r\nable and ubiquitous, web\nintermediaries that process the entity body (and t=\r\nherefore *actually\nrely* on its self-descriptiveness)?!\n\n&gt; So, yes, the abs=\r\nolutely-beyond-any-shadow-of-doubt, most-important\n&gt; aspect of RESTful self=\r\n-descriptive messaging, regardless of protocol,\n&gt; is the media type identif=\r\nier, for any response where such identifier is\n&gt; required.  This is yet ano=\r\nther of those fundamental issues which SHOULD\n&gt; NOT require any debate, so =\r\nyet again, I&#39;m befuddled by the pushback.\n\nThe value you are (correctly) at=\r\ntributing to the media type identifier\nis derived from it&#39;s incorporation t=\r\no a given protocol, such as HTTP,\nfor the purposes of negotiating a  repres=\r\nentation - it&#39;s role is as an\nidentifier first and foremost, and it makes v=\r\nery little difference\nwhether that identifier is opaque or otherwise. This =\r\nis why clients\nand servers can happily negotiate non-standard media type\nre=\r\npresentations via HTTP, as can intermediaries cache them.\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n"}}
