CCXML, its sister language, is machine-oriented though.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As VoiceXML is to HTML, so CCXML is to PHP.  To users in the system,\n&gt; &gt; any PHP and/or CCXML code driving resource state is opaque behind\n&gt; &gt; the Uniform Interface.  CCXML is no more relevant to application\n&gt; &gt; state on the client than PHP is, so I don&#39;t think it solves for the\n&gt; &gt; problem of RESTful m2m media types for representing resource state\n&gt; &gt; to user-agents.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Eric\n&gt; \n&gt; I couldn&#39;t disagree more. A CCXML client makes HTTP requests for\n&gt; CCXML pages that run on a platform that controls client-side\n&gt; resources. Many people write static CCXML pages, but that doesn&#39;t\n&gt; make it any less of a representation language -- each page still has\n&gt; a URI. CCXML is NOT used to generate VoiceXML or any other markup\n&gt; language (not in any system I&#39;ve seen). I&#39;m puzzled as to why you&#39;d\n&gt; have this view. Can you point me to a system where CCXML is used like\n&gt; PHP? Regards,\n&gt; \n\nI stand corrected.  My PHP analogy wasn&#39;t meant to suggest that CCXML\ngenerates VoiceXML, but it does route calls to VoiceXML apps for\nhandling, right?  VoiceXML doesn&#39;t need CCXML any more than HTML needs\nPHP.  But I thought CCXML mostly needed VoiceXML, just as PHP mostly\nneeds HTML.  The similarity I was going for was server-side language, I\nwasn&#39;t aware that CCXML is also intended for clients.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
