If I\n&gt; &gt; POST some data to /foo with an intent of /bar, I&#39;m still doing a POST,\n&gt; &gt; and it&#39;s still the server that has the ultimate say (because \n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s still\n&gt; &gt; a POST).  This is in contrast to invoking the BAR method, which could\n&gt; &gt; mean anything.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d like to understand this point better.  Nothing I can do as a client\n&gt; in the HTTP method space can change the fact that &quot;it&#39;s still the server\n&gt; that has the ultimate say&quot;.  BAR *could* mean anything, while POST already\n&gt; *does* mean anything (virtually).\n\nWhatever BAR might mean, if the community (i.e. IETF) has specified that\nHTTP implementations MUST support BAR, then the server doesn&#39;t have the\nfinal say, the spec does.\n\n&gt; A little clarification: the fact that a server doesn&#39;t have to do what I\n&gt; say in a POST is not a property of POST; it&#39;s a property of HTTP, and more\n&gt; broadly, of server side applications that are autonomous in their\n&gt; respective domains, regardless of which level 7 protocol they use.\n\nIn the broader space of &quot;server side applications&quot;, I&#39;d say that the\nparty(s) that define the contract get the final say.  With most RPC\nsystems, this could be the very people who implement the system, and so\nthey do/can have the final say.  But when the world sits down to design\nan application protocol, it is done with the expectation that\nimplementors - many/most of whom won&#39;t be at the standardization table -\nwill follow the rules in the specification.  And this is, in fact, what\nhappens most of the time.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
