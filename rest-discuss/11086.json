We\nselected it over rome - I don&#39;t recall exactly why anymore, but I\nthink it was because abdera was just atom whereas rome seemed more\nabout abstracting out the differences between rss and atom and we\nreally had no need for that.\n\nI&#39;ll also point out that http://atomserver.codehaus.org/ is based on abdera.\n\n--Chuck\n\nOn Sun, Jul 27, 2008 at 11:37 PM, dev &lt;dev.akhawe@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Abdera\n&gt;\n&gt; I am not sure .. never having used it myself , but please check it out\n&gt; if you haven&#39;t already.
