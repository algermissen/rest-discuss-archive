It\n&gt; was more a matter of unlearning  preconceptions, which is why debates\n&gt; worked better for me than the  straightforward how-to-do-its.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m hearing this &quot;unlearn&quot; a lot.  I haven&#39;t experienced the need to  unlearn anything (maybe I still don&#39;t understand it?)\n&gt; Can you explain for me what you had to unlearn?\n\nIn my case:\n1. Object-oriented programming with different methods for every object.\n2. Distributed objects and distributed transactions using MOM.\n3. EDI and ebXML (I contributed to the specs).\n3. WS-* (I worked on WS-BPEL and WS-CDL for a distributed transaction\nsoftware company).\n\nAlmost like going to confession...\n\nMight be different for different people.\n\n"}}
