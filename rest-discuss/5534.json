I&#39;m working on a new application at the moment and I would like to  \ndo things in a more &#39;REST&#39;-ful manner but I have a question.\n\nAccording to everything that I&#39;ve read, the GET command is used to  \nretrieve some resource.  In the application that I&#39;m working on, I want my  \nservice to return some XML which represents some analytical results based  \non some input from the application.  The input consists of a portfolio of  \ninvestment instruments.  The service looks at the portfolio, does some  \nanalysis and then returns results in XML.  The portfolio can be quite  \nlarge and is XML.  My usual approach would be to simply do a POST of the  \nXML instead of a GET because putting the XML in a URL isn&#39;t workable.  So  \nI might send do a POST to http://foo.bar.com/portfolioAnalysis and the  \nPOSTed data would be the portfolio XML.\n\nI&#39;ve read, however, the POST is supposed to be used for updating not  \nquerying, so it seems wrong to use POST in this case.  Is there a better  \nway to handle this sort of thing?\n\nThanks!\n\n-- \nJames Howe\n\n\n\n\n"}}
