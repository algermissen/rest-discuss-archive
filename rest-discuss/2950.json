He also makes a quick point that you could\nacheive P2P by having both a client and a server on both ends.  However, I\nhave seen several discussions here in which people are talking about the\nserver pushing to the client.  It even seems that Fielding&#39;s own Waka\ncontains features like this.\n\nWouldn&#39;t such an approach be non-RESTful?\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\np.s.
