Is it worth seeing?  If Gene Siskel gives it a\n&quot;two thumbs up&quot;, will you go see it?  Personally, I would like to see a\nnumber of reviews before making my decision.\n\n- Movie review = metadata\n- The movie review from Gene Siskel is your &quot;primary movie review&quot;.\n- Other reviews supplement the primary movie review. \n- To get a complete, more accurate picture, I want an &quot;aggregator&quot; to\nshow me a composite picture.\n- Metadata certainty is an illusion ... The Illusion of Certainty ...\n\nNow translate all these comments into Web services and metadata about\nWeb services.  See where I am going with this?\n\n2.  Separation of concerns.  Keep metadata decoupled from the resource. \nThis enables you to have many different forms of metadata, and also\nenables the distributed metadata implied in 1.\n\nGotta run.  /Roger\n\n\nJeffrey Winter wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am not clear on what you are expecting the HTTP OPTIONS method to\n&gt; &gt; return. [...]  What do you expect to receive back?  Are you expecting to\n&gt; &gt; receive the service description as the payload of the HTTP OPTIONS\n&gt; &gt; response?\n&gt; \n&gt; I guess that&#39;s the point of OPTIONS, I don&#39;t know exactly what I&#39;d get\n&gt; back.  If it&#39;s a WSDL, there are tools that can parse it directly; if\n&gt; it&#39;s a text description, there&#39;s more work to do.  But in any case,\n&gt; one could ask exactly the same questions about the metadata even if\n&gt; it were a separate resource.\n&gt; \n&gt; Granted, OPTIONS is sort of a dark corner of the web right now, but\n&gt; as metadata becomes more important with the advent of web services,\n&gt; perhaps it won&#39;t be always be.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; But, suppose that you have the URL to the service description resource,\n&gt; &gt; e.g.,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     http://www.parts.com/parts/metadata\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; How would you then get the URL to the service that it describes?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Further, we would like to allow other people to independently provide\n&gt; &gt; metadata about the service (just like today other people can hyperlink\n&gt; &gt; to my Web site, without even my knowledge).  For example, perhaps your\n&gt; &gt; company wishes to use the parts service, but your company needs an RDF\n&gt; &gt; description of the service.  So, independent of the parts service you go\n&gt; &gt; off and create your own RDF description of the parts service.  Here&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; your URL:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;      http://www.jwinter.com/services/parts/metadata\n&gt; \n&gt; Instead of having some third party host the metadata - which will inevitably\n&gt; get out of synch with the resource who&#39;s metadata it is (the\n&gt; OPTIONS method is explicitly non-cacheable for probably just that reason) -\n&gt; why not just have a link to the resource itself:\n&gt; \n&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jwinter.com/services/parts&quot;&gt;Car Parts Web Service&lt;/a&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Google would scoop that up even easier.  When you do a search for &quot;Car Parts\n&gt; Web Service&quot;, if enough people have linked to it, it will probably bubble\n&gt; up to the top anyway.  In either case, you&#39;ll be lead to the service itself,\n&gt; then you request the OPTIONS and away you go.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now you need some way to link your service description back to the parts\n&gt; &gt; service.  That&#39;s the purpose of the Meta-About HTTP header.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To recap,\n&gt; &gt; - we wanted the metadata document to be a first class object, separate\n&gt; &gt; from the resource it is describing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Frankly, I prefer the metadata to be tightly bound to the resource it\n&gt; is describing.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; - we wanted to enable anyone to provide metadata about the resource,\n&gt; &gt; i.e., distributed resource description\n&gt; \n&gt; I think this an interesting point, but I&#39;m not sure that it really matters\n&gt; so long as you are able to ultimately locate the resource.  Again, it&#39;s\n&gt; fine for others to host the metadata, but they are going to have to be\n&gt; responsible for keeping it in synch and it might be skipped over by a\n&gt; normal search engine that&#39;s more interested in the text (or the\n&gt; links in Google&#39;s case.)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; - we needed some way to some way to associate a resource to its\n&gt; &gt; (primary) metadata, and to associate metadata to the resource it is\n&gt; &gt; describing.  For this, we created the Meta-Location and the Meta-About\n&gt; &gt; HTTP headers, respectively.\n&gt; \n&gt; Only if you separate them, which granted, is the case today in most\n&gt; cases.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; - we wanted search engines to be able to index resources and metadata\n&gt; &gt; resources using standard HTTP GET.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not sure any search engines out there would even parse\n&gt; and attempt to understand what the metadata even is.  I think my\n&gt; example above is much more likely to find the service and lead you\n&gt; to the metadata.\n&gt; \n&gt; This to me is one of the more insightful statements I&#39;ve read in\n&gt; a while:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;On the other hand, I must say that for me in daily life, Google allows\n&gt; all sorts of useful queries that 5 years ago I thought  would\n&gt; require the widespread adoption of XML and XML-based format standards\n&gt; (e.g., for resumes).  Certainly many of the claims/proposals of metadata\n&gt; advocates 5 years ago look a bit shopworn in hindsight now that we\n&gt; see how well Google does by ignoring all (most?) metadata other than the\n&gt; linking patterns.&quot; [1]\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I hope that helps.  /Roger\n&gt; \n&gt; It does.  I think your right on the money with having web service discovery\n&gt; be a distributed, search-engine based activity as opposed to the UDDI\n&gt; approach. I just think that current technologies already support this\n&gt; without\n&gt; the need to employ extension headers.\n&gt; \n&gt; [1] http://lists.xml.org/archives/xml-dev/200210/msg01625.html\n\n\n"}}
