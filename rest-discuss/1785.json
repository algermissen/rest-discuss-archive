This is the wrong way to do it:  we should\n&gt; really be modeling things differently, but it&#39;s often not clear what the\n&gt; right model should be...  And the arguments in favor of doing it the right\n&gt; way often come across as rather academic.\n\nOne of the problems with teaching REST today is that deployed tools only\ndepend strongly upon the semantics for GET. \n\nPUT, DELETE are mostly ignored except in a WebDAV context. POST is\n&quot;everything that doesn&#39;t make sense as GET&quot;. In part, that&#39;s why I think\nthat WebDAV is a good partner for HTTP in REST systems. When someone\nasks: &quot;what&#39;s the practical consequence of using POST for DELETE&quot; we can\nanswer: &quot;you break compatibility with Windows Explorer and MS Office.&quot;\nSome people will not care but others will.\n\nIn a perfect world, we would all use tools like &quot;wget&quot;, &quot;wput&quot;,\n&quot;wdelete&quot;, &quot;wpost&quot; every day. But really, outside of WebDAV, we only use\n&quot;wget&quot;.\n-- \nCome discuss XML and REST web services at:\n  Open Source Conference: July 22-26, 2002, conferences.oreillynet.com\n  Extreme Markup: Aug 4-9, 2002,  www.extrememarkup.com/extreme/\n\n"}}
