Do we reify subscriptions or not?  (Looking at\n&gt; the spec now, answer&#39;s probably in there.)\n\nI think we always intended to reify subscriptions. The question is\nwhether we redundantly inform the client in notifications:\n\n a) what URI it is being notified about\n b) what subscription caused the notification\n\nHe has some good arguments why we don&#39;t have to do that. The client can\nhave a mapping from subscriber URIs to watches and subscriptions. It\ncould also munge them into the subscriber URI itself. So the extra bytes\nare kind of a waste. Plus they are redundant and could be confusing if\nthe client subscribed under one URI and gets a notification about an\nalternate URI for the same resource.\n\nBut at a deep level I hate the idea of inscrutable bytes arriving from\nsome remote source without telling me WHY they are arriving or HOW I\nwould stop them. That&#39;s why I wanted headers that would make the message\nself describing. You would just click (literally or metaphorically) on\nthe &quot;unsubscribe URI&quot; and the messages would stop arriving....\n\nStill undecided what&#39;s most important. Maybe it is an issue for\nnegotiation: a Verbose: header which defaults to True. Yeah, I kind of\nlike that idea.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
