Application is far more that jus=\r\nt a component. My definition includes\n&gt; business goals and the like, so I w=\r\non&#39;t enter there.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. A system includes not only the components but the =\r\ninter-relationships,\n&gt; interfaces and externally visible properties. As I o=\r\nnce stated in this\n&gt; forum, a client is a role, and can be played by one co=\r\nmponent inside a\n&gt; system A, and by another system B consuming services on =\r\nSystem A. So we can\n&gt; have a system of systems, where their components can =\r\nbe playing different\n&gt; roles, one of them being a client.\n&gt;\n&gt; 3. That clari=\r\nfied, REST is an architectural style that defines component\n&gt; roles and rul=\r\nes of engagement to achieve a set of quality properties.\n&gt; Theory says that=\r\n one component not playing the role or not following the\n&gt; rules, may affec=\r\nt the property quality achievement. Clear?\n&gt;\n&gt; 4. Now, in any modern archit=\r\necture development, we architects should not\n&gt; focus only in functional req=\r\nuirements, but in quality properties too. That\n&gt; means making decisions abo=\r\nut how things are going to work, stating policies\n&gt; and making sure those p=\r\nolicies are enforced. Following this line of\n&gt; thinking, implementing an ar=\r\nchitectural conception that follows REST style,\n&gt; but that does not enforce=\r\n the rules or does not even detect a rule is being\n&gt; broken (a governance p=\r\nroblem), I should say it is a weak implementation.\n&gt; And if we are not in c=\r\nontrol of all components (other people creating their\n&gt; services and client=\r\ns) then we may not achieve the quality properties after\n&gt; all.\n&gt;\n&gt; 5. But a=\r\nll that is not REST fault, and shouldn&#39;t care less. That is the\n&gt; work of t=\r\nhe architect, designers and developers and other stakeholders.\n&gt; REST is no=\r\nt an out-of-the-box solution you get when you install a framework\n&gt; and use=\r\n it. A framework may help, but the actual success of delivering\n&gt; business =\r\nvalue comes from the work of all people. You will get nowhere if a\n&gt; bunch =\r\nof your developers keep not following the rules. If an external\n&gt; &quot;client&quot; =\r\nenters the system, and is not playing the rules, may affect the\n&gt; quality p=\r\nroperties, and sure it will suffer itself from that, when the\n&gt; server chan=\r\nges the uri namespace or the flow, then it becomes a problem of\n&gt; the spoil=\r\ned client.\n&gt;\n&gt; My two cents.\n&gt;\n&gt; William Martinez Pomares\n&gt; --- In rest-dis=\r\ncuss@yahoogroups.com, Mike Kelly &lt;mikekelly321@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Wed, =\r\nMar 7, 2012 at 10:37 PM, mike amundsen &lt;mamund@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; **\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Glenn:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What about the counter view that =\r\neach client and server combo is the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;application&#39;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; first, =\r\ni&#39;m not sure that is a &quot;counter view&quot; of what i said.
