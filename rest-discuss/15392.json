We have built a\n&gt; comprehensive yet small framework since them, with a thriving community\n&gt; behind it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Our Restlet API is both client-side and server-side, both low-level (all\n&gt; HTTP semantics/headers mapped to a clean Java API, see [2]) and high-level\n&gt; (resource handling, limited/focused use of annotations), synchronous or\n&gt; asynchronous (easily supporting provisional 1xx HTTP responses), supports\n&gt; other (pseudo-)protocols than HTTP (FTP, SMTP, POP3, FILE, etc.) and is\n&gt; available in five consistent editions: Java SE/EE, GAE, GWT and Android [3].\n&gt;\n&gt; We also happen to support JAX-RS as an extension, but that&#39;s not what I\n&gt; would recommend as a starting point for you. Our framework lets developers\n&gt; support hypermedia since day one and we have explored higher-level links\n&gt; traversal for a while with our RDF extension [4].\n&gt;\n&gt; Otherwise, we are also working with Microsoft Interop teams to provide\n&gt; advanced client support for the OData protocol [5].\n&gt;\n&gt; IMHO, it would be great to have something similar in the .NET world. I&#39;m\n&gt; glad you are working on such project.
