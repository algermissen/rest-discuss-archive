We have standards for\nauthentication in HTTP and my gut reaction was that they count.\n\n1. Userinfo can be be part of a URI and thus it is by definition part\nof REST. See RFC 2396, look for userinfo. \n\nA URI could look like http://username@host/some/resource and then\nprovoke a 401 Unauthorized response, which would explain how the\nuseragent should authenticate itself.\n\n\n2. But more generally, you&#39;re allowed to take other non-URI\ninformation into account when designing a REST service. \n\nFor example, content-negotiation headers can request a representation\nof the resource in the client&#39;s preferred format. So it seems the URI\nidentifies the resource, but not necessarily the representation.\nThat&#39;s right in the REST paper.\n\n\n3. Authentication is usually achieved in HTTP/1.1 using headers and is\nthus superficially similar to the content-negotiation case. So you\ncould filter content based on user and still claim RESTfulness.\n\nThere are some more subtle issues regarding authentication that Roy\ndiscusses in the REST paper but this answer still looks correct to me.\n\n\n\n"}}
