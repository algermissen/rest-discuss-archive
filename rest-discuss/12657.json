Regarding the  \nperceived overhead, remember that REST is designed to optimize for  \nefficiency but for federated evolution (among others). Use the  \narchirectural goals of REST to judge your solution.\n\nAlternatively you could PATCH the order but would have to do some  \nspecs work inside your domain for the non-standard PATCH and the  \nformat that expresses the delta.\n\nIn addition, verify that the order status change is in fact idempotent  \n(can you PUT the order state N-times and still have the meaning of the  \nsingle PUT?) - if it is not, you must use POST anyway. Often, such  \ncancelations are expressed using explicit cancelation requests (see  \nUBL) instead of business object state changes. So you might even have:\n\n\nPOST /orderManager\n\n&lt;OrderCancelation&gt;\n  &lt;orderId&gt;123456&lt;/orderId&gt;\n&lt;/OrderCancelation&gt;\n\nHTH,\n\nJan\n\n\n\nOn May 19, 2009, at 8:36 PM, Darrel Miller wrote:\n\n&gt; I like\n&gt;\n&gt; POST /Orders/Cancelled?url=/Orders/333\n&gt;\n&gt; It sort of feels like placing the order in the pile of canceled\n&gt; orders.  Viewing the cancelled orders is as simple as\n&gt;\n&gt; GET /Orders/Cancelled\n&gt;\n&gt; and re-opening the order is\n&gt;\n&gt; POST /Orders/Open?url=/Orders/333\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s not the only way but it works for me.\n&gt;\n&gt; Darrel\n&gt;\n&gt; On Fri, May 8, 2009 at 6:09 PM, Bill Burke &lt;bburke@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Let&#39;s say I have an Order resource in a ecommerce Order Entry system.\n&gt;&gt; How would I implement my service so that I can cancel an order rather\n&gt;&gt; than delete it? One is to have the cancel state as part of the order.\n&gt;&gt; THen I can just put a new representation with the cancelled state  \n&gt;&gt; set to\n&gt;&gt; true:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; PUT /orders/333\n&gt;&gt; content-type: application/xml\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;order id=&quot;333&quot;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;cancelled&gt;false&lt;/cancelled&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ...\n&gt;&gt; &lt;/order&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Seems kinda heavy to me.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Would it still be restful to define a &quot;cancelled&quot; URI that you  \n&gt;&gt; could put\n&gt;&gt; or post to to change the state?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; /orders/333/cancelled\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; or\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; /orders/333?cancel=true\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You don&#39;t even need to send data to change the state in this  \n&gt;&gt; scenario.\n&gt;&gt; But the problem with this from a pure RESTful standpoint is, isn&#39;t  \n&gt;&gt; this\n&gt;&gt; a mini-RPC? My thought at first is YES IT IS....\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; .... But, consider if you have cancelling as part of a HATEOAS\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;order id=&quot;333&quot;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;atom:link rel=&quot;CANCEL&quot; href=&quot;http://example.com/orders/333/ \n&gt;&gt; cancelled&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ...\n&gt;&gt; &lt;/order&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Now, I have a CANCEL link that if I follow changes the state of my\n&gt;&gt; resource. Doesn&#39;t seem so RPCish now that I&#39;ve embedded it as a link.\n&gt;&gt; Maybe the answer is /orders/333/cancelled isn&#39;t very RESTful by  \n&gt;&gt; itself,\n&gt;&gt; but when combined with HATEOAS it is?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --\n&gt;&gt; Bill Burke\n&gt;&gt; JBoss, a division of Red Hat\n&gt;&gt; http://bill.burkecentral.com\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
