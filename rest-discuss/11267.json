Any\n&gt; subsequent request to that uri would trigger a 202 until there&#39;s a  \n&gt; final\n&gt; outcome for the backup, that could either be a 200 for success or a  \n&gt; 410 for\n&gt; failure.\n&gt;\n&gt; Some people would argue that 202 is not used correctly if in  \n&gt; response to a\n&gt; get to that resource. However I interpret the spec as saying &quot;the  \n&gt; request\n&gt; has been understood but I can&#39;t give you an answer&quot;. This does imply  \n&gt; that\n&gt; you assign a uri to a resource that doesn&#39;t exist yet, but I don&#39;t  \n&gt; have a\n&gt; fundamental problem with that.\n\nThe fundamental problem with this approach is that the semantics of  \n202 Accepted are unspecified for a GET.\n\nSubbu\n\n\n"}}
