Without any further agreement between us, which one can be\n&gt; &gt; used to do the most things?\n&gt; \n&gt; Well it depends how they are configured. I&#39;d guess it would have to be\n&gt; wide open to do anything useful. Can you make a strong case that a wide\n&gt; open HTTP server is more &quot;powerful&quot; than a wide open FTP server? Either\n&gt; can PUT, GET, DELETE.
