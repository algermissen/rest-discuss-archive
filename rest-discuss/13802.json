While you may try to redefine\nREST as a ref=\r\nerence to the community, everyone else here thinks REST\nspecifically refers=\r\n to Roy&#39;s thesis.  So either accept that and stop\nmaking snarky comments ab=\r\nout the thesis and criticizing answers that\ntry to explain said thesis, or =\r\ngo start rest-discuss-discuss.  Please\nread and try to understand the thesi=\r\ns, instead of cherry-picking from\nit to support your arguments without any =\r\nunderstanding of context.)\n\n&quot;\nREST does not restrict communication to a par=\r\nticular protocol, but it\ndoes constrain the interface between components, a=\r\nnd hence the scope of\ninteraction and implementation assumptions that might=\r\n otherwise be made\nbetween components. For example, the Web&#39;s primary trans=\r\nfer protocol is\nHTTP, but the architecture also includes seamless access to=\r\n resources\nthat originate on pre-existing network servers, including FTP [1=\r\n07],\nGopher [7], and WAIS [36]. Interaction with those services is\nrestrict=\r\ned to the semantics of a REST connector. This constraint\nsacrifices some of=\r\n the advantages of other architectures, such as the\nstateful interaction of=\r\n a relevance feedback protocol like WAIS, in\norder to retain the advantages=\r\n of a single, generic interface for\nconnector semantics.\n&quot;\n\nWhat this means=\r\n is, if you aren&#39;t using HTTP, then you&#39;re limited to\nusing only those aspe=\r\ncts of some other protocol that match the\nsemantics of a generic REST conne=\r\nctor.  If I have a URI and I want to\nallow others to GET a representation o=\r\nf that resource, then I can just\nas easily implement it as FTP -- provided =\r\nthat no content negotiation,\ncaching, or other benefit of REST is required =\r\nfor the interaction.\n\nThis does not mean that any protocol can be used to b=\r\nuild a REST\nsystem, and it does not mean that any operation of some other p=\r\nrotocol\ncan be made RESTful.  If you build a REST system, that doesn&#39;t mean=\r\n you\nshould be able to swap FTP for HTTP on every operation -- that is not\n=\r\nwhat protocol independence means.  FTP is *not* a RESTful protocol, but\nfor=\r\n some application interactions FTP may very well be substituted for\nHTTP wi=\r\nthout breaking the uniform interface constraint, while there&#39;s no\nway to mo=\r\ndel FTP&#39;s MGET method as a single, RESTful interaction.\n\nHTTP 1.1 is the on=\r\nly protocol out there which was specifically designed\nas a REST application=\r\n protocol. FTP is just a transport protocol.  I&#39;m\nnot counting Atom Protoco=\r\nl since it requires HTTP.  A REST protocol\nlike AtomPub couldn&#39;t have been =\r\nbased around any other protocol,\nbecause there aren&#39;t any other REST applic=\r\nation protocols to choose\nfrom (at least until Roy gets off his butt and fi=\r\nnishes Waka... ;-).\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I mean, what company doesn&#39;t use now email, or JM=\r\nS for instance, in \n&gt; their day to day operations? We do it, using diferent=\r\n connectors to \n&gt; connect to our resources, in protocols like JMS and IMAP =\r\nand intra-VM \n&gt; and I think some more.\n&gt; \n\nThat&#39;s all fine and good, provid=\r\ned that you&#39;re implementing a generic\ninterface as seen from the outside wo=\r\nrld.  REST certainly allows you to\nimplement a layer between your internal =\r\nJMS, IMAP or whatever other\ncomponents you have, and the WWW, using HTTP.  =\r\nRoy&#39;s thesis again:\n\n&quot;\nA disadvantage of the uniform interface is that it m=\r\nay reduce network\nperformance if the data needs to be converted to or from =\r\nits natural\nformat.\n&quot;\n\nIOW, if you have some JMS or IMAP component, you may=\r\n need to implement\na layer to convert from that &quot;natural format&quot; to one tha=\r\nt&#39;s compatible\nwith HTTP. REST doesn&#39;t imply that IMAP interactions can be =\r\nmade RESTful\n-- it does imply that you can use HTTP to access a resource th=\r\nat&#39;s\nnormally managed by IMAP.  Think Webmail, where you can use HTTP to\nin=\r\nteract with your e-mail account from any Web browser, instead of\nbeing limi=\r\nted to using an e-mail client that speaks IMAP.\n\nSo you can&#39;t make IMAP who=\r\nlly RESTful, but you can design a REST system\nusing HTTP to accomplish the =\r\nsame goals for a user, by encapsulating\nyour IMAP system within a REST laye=\r\nr.  (Not that I&#39;ve ever seen a\nRESTful Webmail system, but there&#39;s no reaso=\r\nn one can&#39;t be built.)\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
