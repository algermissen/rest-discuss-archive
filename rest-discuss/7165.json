Did you have a point to make\n&gt;&gt; &gt; about POST being degenerate (whatever you mean by that)? Is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; this something we need to care about?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I think it is. HTTP without POST is an interesting gedanken experiment.\n&gt;&gt; It&#39;s like having English without &quot;just do it&quot;.\n&gt; IMO, POST adds to the game the ability to request a resource creation \n&gt; from a specific server. When I only have PUT, I can find out whether a \n&gt; PUT succeeds, but I have no way of creating my resource &#39;as a \n&gt; subordinate&#39; of another resource. IOW, I have no idea how or if the \n&gt; server is managing my new resource.\n&gt; \n&gt; With the availability of POST, a server can tell me: &quot;This resource \n&gt; accepts data submission; it accepts this and that media type *and* the \n&gt; server can tell me that the accepting resource has &quot;certain abstract \n&gt; behaviour&quot;[1]. It is a difference to store (PUT) information on a server \n&gt; that does versioning vs on one that does not. POST gives me the ability \n&gt; to store stuff &#39;under the management&#39; of a certain resource.\n\nSure, but are storage (to store) and creation (to create) always the \nmotivating reasons? And aren&#39;t they different methods?\n\nIt often seems to me that POST is a catchall for &quot;do it&quot;. I guess the \nreason I&#39;m pushing on this is to figure out why the 2 verb web is a \nrunaway success. What&#39;s driving that? Is it because of the design \nprinciples? Or because POST is so decoupled from meaning? Or would \nthings simply be much better even we had a broader vocabulary deployed \nunder the design principles?\n\n[I understand the idea that the web&#39;s success is intrinsically tied to \nPOST being a free for all (and often onto gateways) is not an orthodox \nview.]\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
