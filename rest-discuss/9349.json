However,\n&gt; precisely because XML is less structured than maps and lists\n&gt; and tables, it can handle more information than can be encoded\n&gt; in maps and lists and tables. There are many, many examples\n&gt; where JSON (and other map-list data structures) becomes\n&gt; practically unmanageable but which XML handles without\n&gt; blinking. However it&#39;s not a two-way street. XML cannot only\n&gt; encode everything JSON can encode. It can do so practically,\n&gt; usefully, and efficiently. The reverse is not true.\n\nThe reverse *is* true. JSON can encode highly structured data\nmore practically, usefully and efficiently than XML ever has.\n\nJSON targets a much smaller problem domain than XML, but that\nis precisely why it can work in that domain much better than\nXML could ever hope to.\n\nAnd I say that just a day after defending XML against a haters\nand a dogpile of JSON apologists in a weblog. Both technologies\nhave their applications. Constraints and restrictions are great.\nHey, isn’t this rest-discuss? You’d think this point wouldn’t\nneed making in this crowd…\n\nConsidering that you were only just fervently talking about how\ndatabase people tend to see tables everywhere, it surprises me\nthat you go on to say to XML should be your hammer and every\nproblem a nail.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
