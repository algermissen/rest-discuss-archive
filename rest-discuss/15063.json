What you\ncan do, in response to any request method invoked on a resource, is\nsend &quot;Allow: HEAD, GET, DELETE&quot; (don&#39;t forget HEAD) and Accept headers.\n\nThe &#39;edit&#39; link relation is commonly understood to support GET, PUT and\nDELETE.  If your application isn&#39;t accepting PUT, then respond 405 or\n501 as appropriate, along with the Allow: header.  If PUT is accepted,\nbut the wrong media type is used, respond 415 -- what&#39;s authoritative\nin REST is the response code for any given request, i.e. the only way\nto know if DELETE is actually allowed, is if a DELETE request yields a\n2xx response.\n\nYou don&#39;t have to specify all this implementation detail in your markup.\nIncluding it in headers still qualifies as &quot;hypertext&quot; so don&#39;t sweat\nit.  The Accept and Allow headers are part of implementing the self-\ndescriptive messaging constraint, and the hypertext constraint.\n\nOf course, the Allow and Accept headers can&#39;t tell you what media type\nto associate with what method.  Although in this case, it&#39;s implied by\nthe media type definitions themselves to some extent:\n\nAccept: application/atom+xml, application/x-www-urlencoded\nAllow: HEAD, GET, PUT, POST, DELETE\nContent-Type: application/atom+xml\n\nI wouldn&#39;t expect to be able to PUT application/x-www-urlencoded.  But\nheaders aren&#39;t fine-grained enough to express whether I can POST\napplication/atom+xml.  The rest of the hypertext constraint is met via\nmarkup, which is fine-grained enough to express a self-documenting API.\n\nBut, this isn&#39;t done with &lt;link/&gt;, it&#39;s done with &lt;form&gt;, either Xforms\nor HTML 5 allow you to read the href of a &lt;link rel=&#39;edit&#39;/&gt; (or rel=\n&#39;source&#39;) and express not only _that_ it may have its GET or DELETE\nmethod called, but _how_ to call those methods, i.e. user dereferences a\nlink or clicks a &#39;delete&#39; button.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
