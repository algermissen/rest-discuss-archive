I have to admit that i don&#39;t really understand.\nYou have to define a format that is suitable for any kind of\napplication. This look quite ambitious. You can use RDF to help the\nrepresentation to be self descriptive, but you still have to define (ou\nrefine) and RDFS. From an other pov, your proposal looks like wsdl (as \nBill? said).\n\n&gt; \n&gt; HOW do you know that /inbox/ actually is a container containing MIME \n&gt; messages?\n\nit&#39;s a one-line-doc matter...  :), or application/x-container, and no\nneed for doc!\n\n&gt; Also, what does it mean actually to be a container?  FIFO? LIFO? by \n&gt; from-address...?  How does the shape of the container relate to your index \n&gt; format for representing it?\n\nwhy does the client have to care about that ???\n\n&gt; MoST provides enough constraints so that knowing *ONLY* your index format, \n&gt; a client can deliver mail.\n\nHere, i don&#39;t have to anything about the index format to deliver mail. I\nhave to know about it to retrieve mails. To deliver, all i have to know\nis that /inbox/ accepts mime as the Content-Type of a POST, which can be\nstated in an OPTION response (not sure) .\n\n&gt;   The client does not need to know *anything* \n&gt; about how the server thinks about inboxes internally.\n\nWhy does it need it in the proposed example ?\n\n&gt;  Your inbox format caused me to assume you \n&gt; intended something similar.  It implies that mail delivery is simply adding \n&gt; an entry to an index and letting the client be responsible for storing the \n&gt; message at some URI.\n\nno. \n\n&gt; However, if you want mail storage to be the recipient&#39;s responsibility, and \n&gt; you want messages in MIME format, you should use a format for your inbox \n&gt; that supports appending MIME messages e.g. mbox or multipart/digest.\n\nagin, no. \n\nthe index is a *representation* of the container. e.g.\n\nc: \nGET /inbox/\n\ns:\n200 ok\naaa: http://host/inbox/aaa-mid\nbbb: http://host/inbox/aaa-mid\n\nc:\nGET /inbox/aaa-mid\n\ns:\n200 ok\nMIME version: 1.0\n...\n\nc:\nPOST /inbox/\nContent-Type: mime/rfc-822\n\nMIME ...\nSubject: ccc\nMessage-ID: ccc-mid\n...\n\ns:\n201 created\nLocation: http://host/inbox/ccc-mid\n\nc:\nGET /inbox/\n\ns:\n200 \nok\n\naaa: http://host/inbox/aaa-mid\nbbb: http://host/inbox/aaa-mid\nccc: http://host/inbox/ccc-mid\n\n\n\nbut this example is juste quickly imagined to be an example, and must\nnot be considered as a proposal, nor as an complete and robust system.\nthere is surely problems in it :)\nbut it is concrete. Can&#39;t you give a concrete example of MoST model ?\n\n\n&gt; -Alex-\n&gt; \n&gt; ___________________________________________________________________\n&gt; S.
