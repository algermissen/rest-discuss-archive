Is there a\n&gt; standard way to link from a collection to a feed containing the changes to\n&gt; this collection?\n\nthis is a very common pattern and basically is a simplified case of \nmonitoring a server-side process&#39; state, only that the state in this \ncase is a pretty static address, and not some business process that \nmight go through more complex state changes advertised in the associated \nfeed. anyway, yes, it&#39;s a good and RESTful way to do this.\n\nbut as you noted, you&#39;ll need a way to signal DELETE changes to a \nresource in the associated feed. this is not possible in base atom. \nhttp://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-snell-atompub-tombstones has been in \nthe pipeline for a long time and hopefully it will soon be completed, \nsince it is essential for pretty much any scenario like yours. afaik, it \nalready has been used in some implementations, and the idea is fairly \nsimple, so i wouldn&#39;t be too worried about using it already.\n\ndoes anybody know what&#39;s holding up the tombstones? if there&#39;s anything \ni can do to push this effort, i am willing to do it. we will make heavy \nuse of tombstones as well, and i&#39;d be interested to refer to an RFC \ninstead of a draft rather sooner than later.\n\ncheers,\n\ndret.\n\n"}}
