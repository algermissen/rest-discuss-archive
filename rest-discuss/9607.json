More hierarchy wasn&#39;t a very good way for me to describe it. A \n&quot;richer&quot; URI space what I really want.\n\n&gt; If http://example.com/v1/foo/ &lt;http://example.com/v1/foo/&gt;{id} consists \n&gt; of links to representations\n&gt; of the &quot;nodes&quot; rather than full information on them then the client can\n&gt; decide which items are of interest to it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any RESTful design (whether human-readable or machine-readable) contains\n&gt; a tension between the advantages and disadvantages of putting every\n&gt; available piece of information into a single representation (in\n&gt; human-readable applications that would be a one-page website) and of\n&gt; splitting everything out as finely as possible. We strive to find\n&gt; natural &quot;lumps&quot; of information. If your problem is that your lumps are\n&gt; large, then you may just need more smaller lumps. The advantages are\n&gt; greater if some of the finer grains are shared between more than one of\n&gt; the larger &quot;lumps&quot; you have now, since this magnifies the advantages of\n&gt; caching (both the caching inherent to REST and the possibility of\n&gt; clients caching the objects they create when parsing).\n\nMy problem is that for a variety of reasons (not all of which I \nunderstand or know yet) there are clients that want varying degrees of \nlumpiness. Using the human-readable analogy, I need to provide for very \nshallow websites with very few links, deep websites with a more natural \nnumber of links, and website where certain links and lumps just aren&#39;t \nthere.\n\nRight now, I&#39;m leaning towards the query string approach. I think that \nwill let me design the URI space to it&#39;s most &quot;natural&quot; form, let \nclients adjust that, and keep all the benefits of REST.\n\n-Michael\n\n\n"}}
