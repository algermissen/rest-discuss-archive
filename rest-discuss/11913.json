Entity headers like Content-Type  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; pr=\r\novide metadata about the entity. What a given media type means is  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; so=\r\nmething clients and servers learn out of band. This is true for  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; exis=\r\nting IANA media types as well as new media types.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yes, and that&#39;s n=\r\not a good thing.  It means that user agents,  \n&gt; &gt; intermediaries, and serv=\r\ners must be revved simultaneously.  The cost  \n&gt; &gt; of &quot;educating&quot; end-point=\r\ns is so enormous that it should only be done  \n&gt; &gt; as a collective effort (=\r\nI did a post on this some weeks ago showing  \n&gt; &gt; the information theoretic=\r\nal justification for this).  It also means  \n&gt; &gt; that there is no graceful =\r\ndegradation since either a MIME type is  \n&gt; &gt; known or it&#39;s not.  And it do=\r\nesn&#39;t set the stage for serendipitous  \n&gt; &gt; engineering, imo.\n\nI&#39;m with Ste=\r\nve here. I mean, if we&#39;re trying to stick to the specs,\nhow about http://ww=\r\nw.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.7 :\n&quot;Use of non-registere=\r\nd media types is discouraged.&quot; ?\n\nI think the Obasanjo article supports the=\r\n idea that OpenSocial is a\ngood approach - no coupling to specific URI sche=\r\nmes, and no client\n&quot;guessing&quot; either. And it&#39;s based on using the well-stan=\r\ndardized\n(though not IANA-registered?) &#39;application/xrds+xml&#39; media type,\nr=\r\nather than inventing a new media type. Same with some other\nwell-designed R=\r\nESTful API&#39;s that have been mentioned.\n\nSo, similarly, Flickr/Picasa/Panora=\r\nmio could use a microformat or some\nother semantically-enabled format to ma=\r\nke their services more\nportable. No need for a new media type.\n\nLike I said=\r\n, I could see a theoretical case for both, but as a matter\nof practicality,=\r\n I would err on the side of using an existing media\ntype that supports sema=\r\nntic extensions for specific purposes.\n\n\n"}}
