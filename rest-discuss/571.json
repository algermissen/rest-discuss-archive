I&#39;m suggesting\n&gt; that a POST to the Subscriber: URI has as its appropriate (and only) interpretation\n&gt; that the Subscribed-URI has changed.  (Applications might further describe *how* it\n&gt; has changed via headers or body, but IMO that&#39;s app-specific and should be\n&gt; out-of-scope for our purposes.)  What other interpretation of POST could there be?\n&gt; And why allow any other method to have those semantics?\n\nOne way of looking at it is that the notifications are trying to\nreplicate the content from the publisher to the subscriber. So the\npublisher PUSHes representations of the resource or POSTs\nrepresentations of changes or extensions to the resource. This would\nimply that it would DELETE if the resource was deleted. I don&#39;t think\nthat view is going to go anywhere.\n\nWhether or not you agree with this model you might still want to allow\nthe application to choose its own method. It would be up to the\npublisher and subscriber to decide what the methods mean exactly.\n\nAnother way of looking at it (Alex&#39;s) is that the POSTs to the listener\nwould come from the app that owns the listener and would be used to\nconfigure it. So then the publisher should send NOTIFYs.\n\nOr you could say that POSTs on listeners come from publishers but\nDELETEs come from the application. Not sure what you would say about\nPUT, probably from the publisher...\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
