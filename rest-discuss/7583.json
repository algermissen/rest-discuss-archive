In a state transition \n&gt;&gt;&gt; diagram, that would be fairly easy to describe the desired \n&gt;&gt; behavior. \n&gt;&gt;&gt; In an &#39;action\n&gt;&gt; can you please elaborate? \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; oriented&#39; approach, you&#39;d have to special case that to prevent \n&gt;&gt;&gt; multiple initializations/etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry I wasn&#39;t clear.\n&gt; I pictured an implementation of &#39;start&#39; that blindly allocated resources,\n&gt; started processes, etc. \n&gt; If a &#39;start&#39; message were sent twice, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this\n&gt; resource allocation and process startup code tried to run a second time.\n&gt; Although it would be easy to guard against this, if the meaning of the API\n&gt; was &quot;execute that code&quot;, it seems odd that the server would refuse to do\n&gt; what it advertised as it&#39;s job.\n&gt; With a state transfer, setting the state of a resource to the same value\n&gt; twice is easy to describe and easy to accept multiple redundant messages and\n&gt; honor the externally visible interface.\n\nexcellent point.\n\nhow about something slightly different: the service resource can have a &#39;start schedule&#39; property. then, the client can set this property to a date, or &#39;now&#39;. when the service is started, this property becomes read-only until the service is stopped (by having a stop schedule property). the status of the service is a read only property, updated by the server.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n-- \n===================================\nIttay Dror, \nChief architect, \nR&D, Qlusters Inc.\nittayd@...\n+972-3-6081994 Fax: +972-3-6081841\n\nwww.openqrm.org - Data Center Provisioning\n\n"}}
