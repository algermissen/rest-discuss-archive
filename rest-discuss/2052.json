Once I get my tutorial completed I will show how it\nall fits in with REST.  But for now, here&#39;s the question:\n\nI would like to create a REST resource which serves up XML and receives\nXML.  For those clients at a browser the XML will be styled into HTML\nvia an XSLT stylesheet.  Suppose that this styling results in an HTML\nform that the user fills in to create a Purchase Order.  After the user\nfills in the form he presses &quot;Submit&quot;.  I would like for the Submit\naction to result in kicking off some script which harvests the data in\nthe HTML form, create an XML string from the form data, and then HTTP\nPUTs the XML string back to the resource.  That&#39;s where I am stuck.  I\nknow how to write some Javascript to harvest the form data and create an\nXML string, but I don&#39;t know how to then HTTP PUT the XML string to the\nresource (i.e., server).  Any ideas?  /Roger\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\nrest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
