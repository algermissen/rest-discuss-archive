That was always in the back of my mind too, though as=\r\n one\n&gt; possible consequence of capturing the full meaning in a single digit=\r\nal\n&gt; package.\n\nWell, that would only argue for a signature being exchanged =\r\ninstead\nof an etag (or just put the signature in the etag).  IOW, it doesn&#39;=\r\nt\nresolve the theoretical question.\n\n&gt;&gt; This reason may not have been Roy&#39;s=\r\n reason for including self-descriptive messages as a REST constraint, but i=\r\nt would be important in business contract situations.\n&gt; \n&gt; I can&#39;t remember=\r\n when or where, but I recall Roy talking about how\n&gt; HTML documents needed =\r\ntheir stylesheets and images in order to fully\n&gt; reflect the intent of the =\r\npublisher in a legal context. Not sure if\n&gt; that was based on conjecture or=\r\n actual case law though.\n\nConjecture ... fidelity of reproduction is the es=\r\nsential element for\nlegal documents, which is why certain forms of TIFF and=\r\n PDF are\nofficially recognized standards for archival forms.  However, peop=\r\nle\nin lawsuits present HTML all the time -- they just have to provide\nit in=\r\n both rendered and plain text forms, and then call some witness\nto establis=\r\nh that the HTML would have matched the printed format\nwhen rendered by a ty=\r\npical browser at the time.\n\n\nNo, I am not going to &quot;settle&quot; the philosophic=\r\nal question with an\nauthoritative answer.  I wouldn&#39;t learn anything if I d=\r\nid.\n\nI suggest folks worry less about that constraint (of visibility during=\r\n\na POST, which we already know isn&#39;t visible by nature) and more about\nwhat=\r\n properties are lost by representation-by-reference.  Most of the\nvalue cas=\r\nes for REST apply to repeatable responses, not an application\nthat can&#39;t be=\r\n reused, can&#39;t be transformed, and can&#39;t be shared.\nI do not believe in try=\r\ning to apply all of REST&#39;s constraints unless\nthere is a reason for doing s=\r\no (aside from buzzword compatibility).\n\nMy guess is that coupling would be =\r\nmore of a hazard than loss of\nvisibility, but maybe even that wouldn&#39;t matt=\r\ner if the application is\nentirely driven via hypertext.  It is really hard =\r\nto get excited\nabout the finer points of API design when the chosen method =\r\nalready\nsays &quot;do whatever you like with this&quot;.\n\n....Roy\n"}}
