I haven&#39;t well understood the answer, which was a link \nto the wikki FAQ. Here are my thoughts about jabber (mainly from &quot;Programming \nJabber&quot; Ed. O&#39;Reilly) and /reasons/ why it cool be suitable for rest.\n\t- Jabber is resources oriented: you can specify a resources for any \nkind of &quot;things&quot; in the jabber world. For &quot;human users&quot;, it could be the \nclient on desktop at work, the client on laptop, the bot logging conference \nrooms, and so on. For a server agent, it could be any thing you want, e.g. a \nchannel feeding rss, a room for conference transport, etc.\n\t- Jabber is full XML, in the protocol, the communications and the \ndata. Even the storage is XML (it could be also a DB or an other kind of \npersistence system). Moreover, it rely on name spaces. Therefore it is fully \nextensible.\n\t- Resource management is based on few methods, such as &quot;get&quot; and &quot;set&quot;\n\t- All resources are &quot;browsable&quot;, that is you can &quot;query&quot; a resource to \nknow some kind of metadata about it. For a service for example, it return the \nfields to fill to subscribe. It could be parameters required to submit a \nquery, or whatever. In many clients, forms are dynamically built according to \nthis feature.\n\t- The connection can be server initiated (i.e. push) which can&#39;t be \ndone with http. This can be useful in many context, specially in asynchronous \nsystems.\n\t- Use management and subscription (and authentication) is built-in. \nAuthentication is included in HTTP, but the subscription stage left to the \nimplementation.\n\t- As in http, communication can be secured with ssl\nReading jabber stuff, I thought about other suitable things, but i can&#39;t \nremember them right now.\nIt seems to me that all HTTP feature can be managed with jabber, but with \nother built-in cool added possibilities.\n\nAnother approach... Does anyone here has implemented (or tested, or at least \nthought about) a rest architecture above Gnutella? I&#39;ve recently learned that \nGnutella is actually extended Http. It could solve the &quot;push&quot; problem, and \nother aspect that I wanted delegate to Jabber :)\nI know that HTTP is one of the foundations of Rest, but take the time to think \nabout these ideas. I hope I&#39;m not too presumptuous, and I certainly miss \nsomething. So please explain...  :)\nThanks in advance\n\n-------------------------------\n  Yannick Loiseau\n mailto:yloiseau@...\n-------------------------------\n\n"}}
