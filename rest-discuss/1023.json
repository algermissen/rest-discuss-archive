Thanks JCP.)\n\nActually, more recent versions of the servlet specs provide a standard\nmechanism for mapping paths to servlets. Using this, you can implement your\nown dispatcher in the form of a servlet. It just needs some URL base mapped\nto it. You could (I believe) have the dispatcher invoke JSPs.\n\nThis is certainly more work, though, and current tools are certainly not\ngeared toward the sort of approach to web development advocated by REST. And\nfor ASP, AFAIK you&#39;d have to implement an ISAPI filter to do this, which is\nnot trivial and is beyond the skill set of the typical web developer.\n\n"}}
