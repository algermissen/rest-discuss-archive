The big\n&gt;  organization that I was referring to had (amongst others) a Novell\n&gt;  Netware proxy server. It was at least 10 years old.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I recently made a trip to a medium sized company who were still using\n&gt;  Microsoft Proxy Server 1.0. I don&#39;t even want to think about how old\n&gt;  that is.\n\nAs long as we are being brutally honest about how things work\nin *the real world*, I&#39;ll just point out that if some VP\ndiscovered that he couldn&#39;t edit his blog from his shiny new Nokia phone\nbecause the proxy server blocked PUT requests, then that proxy would\nget changed so fast it would make your eyes bleed.\n\nTo put this in perspective we&#39;re talking about a configuration\noption on an HTTP proxy/firewall in a company that 11 years\nago was probably running SNA over token ring. To pretend that\nthings will stay the same as they are today is, at best, delusional.\n\n   -joe\n\n-- \nJoe Gregorio        http://bitworking.org\n\n"}}
