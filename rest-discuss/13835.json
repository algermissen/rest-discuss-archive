That =\r\nyou\n&gt; don&#39;t want to discuss things I said is up to you, you don&#39;t have to\n&gt;=\r\n answer them anyway.\n&gt; \n\nWhere have I contradicted myself?  What I&#39;m doing =\r\nis pointing out to\nyou that your attitude needs adjustment, unless your int=\r\nention is to\ncome across as a troll.  This is an observation, not an insult=\r\n, since\nobviously English is your second language.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Bottom line on this=\r\n thread, my point is that a REST Client does not\n&gt; have to be a HTTP Client=\r\n. So a thread that start as &quot;Generic REST\n&gt; client&quot; should had been named &quot;=\r\nGeneric HTTP client for REST&quot;. What I\n&gt; did was to point that out.\n&gt; \n\nBut =\r\nthat isn&#39;t right, as I pointed out in response.  For example, curl\nis not a=\r\n generic HTTP client, since if you enter an FTP URI it will\nwork.  A generi=\r\nc REST client can&#39;t be limited to being a generic HTTP\nclient, since some U=\r\nRIs in a REST system may very well use different\nprotocols.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I could co=\r\nmment some of your points - to which in some cases I agree\n&gt; as I said in t=\r\nhe earlier post -  and in some cases clarify what I\n&gt; said or what you say =\r\nI said (which is not the same), but it&#39;s visible\n&gt; that you&#39;re not interest=\r\ned in coming down from your high-horse and\n&gt; you just dismiss as &quot;trolling&quot;=\r\n anything that doesn&#39;t fit your way of\n&gt; thinking.\n&gt; \n\nYes, and this has be=\r\nen your response to my posts since you joined this\nlist -- that I must have=\r\n something wrong with me, because I attempt to\ncorrect your mistakes.  Your=\r\n obstinance to responses from myself and\nothers is hardly an example of me =\r\nbeing on any sort of horse.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Note that you started your *first* respons=\r\ne to a post of mine by\n&gt; saying\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;ve been responding to your posts for =\r\nmonths.  You get huffy with me\nevery time I do, so I checked your posts in =\r\nthreads I didn&#39;t\nparticipate in, and found the same attitude towards those =\r\nhelping you\nthat I myself experienced, off and on over the past several mon=\r\nths.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; When I refer to REST in my post I was referring to the REST comm=\r\nunity,\n&gt; from which the members of this list are a subset, and as such I wa=\r\ns\n&gt; referring the necessity of having a community-driven resource, such as\n=\r\n&gt; a wiki or such, where the community could agree on those &quot;formal&quot;\n&gt; defin=\r\nitions (even if those definitions are just a copy&paste from\n&gt; Fielding dis=\r\nsertation excerpts), and could be used as reference by\n&gt; everybody, special=\r\nly by new-comers.\n&gt; \n\nOr did you forget saying that?  REST always and only =\r\nrefers to the\narchitectural style described by Dr. Fielding&#39;s dissertation.=\r\n  Notice\nhow you complain about the entire community on a regular basis?  D=\r\nid you\nforget complaining that REST needs a wiki or something, despite such=\r\n a\nwiki already existing? That response of yours from a little while back,\n=\r\nplus your recurring complaint about responses steeped in references to\nsaid=\r\n thesis, is why I prefaced my last response with a note about what\nthis gro=\r\nup&#39;s purpose is.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; However, regrettably, judging by several conversation=\r\ns on this list,\n&gt; it seems that the REST community likes to cultivate some =\r\nsort of\n&gt; obscurantism at the level of concepts, and like to avoid all the\n=\r\n&gt; practical questions of developing software based on the REST style.\n&gt;\n\nTh=\r\nere you went again.  You didn&#39;t immediately understand REST, which\nmust be =\r\na failure of the group, because we deliberately cultivate\n&quot;obscurantism&quot; in=\r\nstead of answering questions.  No, we assume you&#39;ve\nread the thesis, and se=\r\narched the list archives for answers, before\nasking questions.  As I&#39;ve sai=\r\nd before, REST is not easy to learn.\nThis doesn&#39;t mean the answers you&#39;re g=\r\niven are deliberately meant to \nconfuse you.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Eric, don&#39;t take it wrong=\r\n but I read your post and sincerely I think\n&gt; &quot;what does this has to do wit=\r\nh what?&quot; Take this for example:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; In a RESTful system, once a user has=\r\n completed their series of\n&gt; &gt; application interactions, a history of the s=\r\nteady-states is\n&gt; &gt; contained in the browser history.\n&gt; \n&gt; What browser (an=\r\nd what user)? We have a Restfull (almost)\n&gt; infrastructure that we use in o=\r\nrder to put our different software\n&gt; modules communicating with each other,=\r\n sometimes using HTTP, other JMS\n&gt; or IMAP...\n&gt; \n\nIf you can&#39;t extrapolate =\r\n&quot;browser&quot; into &quot;client&quot; then I don&#39;t know how\nto help you.  If one uses cur=\r\nl, then the history is right there in the\nshell history -- scroll up.  The =\r\nnature of a REST application is that\neach request and response may be logge=\r\nd.  What client is used to run\nthat REST application is simply not relevant=\r\n.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; And the rest of your post is similar to this quote, and I don&#39;t\n&gt; un=\r\nderstand what it has to do with &quot;application&quot; and &quot;application\n&gt; state&quot; in =\r\nthe realm of a RESTfull based system (not a HTTP based\n&gt; system).\n&gt; \n\nYes, =\r\nyour failure to understand my post is obviously because I don&#39;t\nknow what I=\r\n&#39;m talking about, or am deliberately trying to confuse you.\nI really don&#39;t =\r\nunderstand how you fail to see that your responses may\nbe considered rude. =\r\n The particular client is irrelevant, and does not\nchange the definition of=\r\n &quot;REST application&quot; as &quot;what the user intends\nto accomplish,&quot; and it is als=\r\no irrelevant whether that user is a person\nor a machine -- application mean=\r\ns the same thing.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; There are things that we can extrapolate from HTTP t=\r\no a more general\n&gt; level in order to fit other protocols, like we did with =\r\nsome HTTP\n&gt; headers that we use generically, but not concepts like &quot;browser=\r\n\n&gt; history&quot;.\n&gt; \n\nIf you&#39;re using a generic interface, then the protocol doe=\r\nsn&#39;t matter,\nand it&#39;s simple to extrapolate &quot;browser history&quot; into &quot;a log o=\r\nf the\nrequests made and the responses received&quot; regardless of client. Since=\r\n\nyour response came as fast as you could type it, pardon me for assuming\nth=\r\nat you didn&#39;t make any effort to understand what I wrote, first.\nThat&#39;s exa=\r\nctly what trolls do, which is why I used that word.\n\nIf you don&#39;t want to b=\r\ne accused of trolling, then please, take the time\nto read and re-read peopl=\r\nes&#39; responses until you do understand, instead\nof immediately finding fault=\r\n and rushing to make rude posts in\nresponse.  Or, ask a question or two at =\r\na time, instead of a wholesale\ndisassembly of an entire response for the pu=\r\nrpose of pointing out its\nshortcomings as relates to your particular needs.=\r\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; So maybe I&#39;m contradicting myself regarding the conceptual/practical\n=\r\n&gt; dichotomy I referred in other post, but concepts like &quot;application&quot;\n&gt; and=\r\n &quot;application state&quot; have to be formally defined at the most\n&gt; abstract lev=\r\nel as possible, so they can be applied on the ground.\n&gt; \n\nBut they are form=\r\nally defined, unless you don&#39;t consider a thesis which\ndescribes these term=\r\ns as &quot;formal&quot;.  In your next reply to that thread,\nyou seemed surprised to =\r\nfind that I was right, &quot;application&quot; and\n&quot;application state&quot; and &quot;transitio=\r\nnal state&quot; are all defined in black\nand white in the thesis.  Believe it or=\r\n not, these terms are a regular\ntopic of discussion here.\n\nIn fact, &quot;What d=\r\noes application state mean?&quot; is a FAQ here, because it\nis central to unders=\r\ntanding REST, where &#39;S&#39; stands for &#39;State&#39;.  If\nRoy&#39;s thesis isn&#39;t clear en=\r\nough, then search the archives of this list,\nor check the wiki, before comp=\r\nlaining that terms like &quot;transitional\nstate&quot; were just coined recently, for=\r\n the purpose of confusing newbies.\nThey&#39;re discussed all the time, that was=\r\n just the first thread about it\nsince you joined.\n\nAgain, it seemed you wer=\r\ne more interested in criticizing my answer than\nunderstanding it, since you=\r\n immediately responded with criticism.\nWhich, after several occurences, som=\r\ne not involving me at all, led me to\nask if you are a troll.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, if =\r\nyou read my previous posts on this thread, where did I tried\n&gt; to redefine =\r\nREST, made snarky comments, criticizing answers,\n&gt; cherry-picking whatever?=\r\n\n&gt; \n\nDoes this response jog your memory?  I could post plenty of examples o=\r\nf\neverything I have accused you of, including from threads I didn&#39;t\npartici=\r\npate in. I haven&#39;t flamed anybody anywhere for over a year, it&#39;s\nhardly som=\r\nething I do on a whim, or without reason.  If you don&#39;t like\nhow you come a=\r\ncross to people, then change the nature of your posts.\nPeople here are genu=\r\ninely trying to help you understand REST, and your\nresponse is to continual=\r\nly criticize the help you&#39;re given, and whine\nabout how the entire group is=\r\n out to get you.\n\nMaybe that&#39;s why many of your questions are ignored?  I&#39;m=\r\n just\nsuggesting that perhaps that&#39;s *your* problem, not everyone else&#39;s\nfa=\r\niling.  Because it seems like you&#39;re the one on a high horse.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
