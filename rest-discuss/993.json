This is absolutely correct.  In fact, this parallels how &#39;/&#39; is viewed and\nwhat paths mean in some of the more advanced filesystem namespace uses.  Path\nelements can be more profitably viewed as named &quot;views&quot; on some part of an\ninformation space, and &quot;/&quot; becomes a mechanism for composing those views,\nexpressing in some sense subordinate views which &quot;narrow&quot; a larger view.\n\nThis is a general problem with modeling, too.  This problem actually bit us in\nthe ass at Clickfeed.  We had &quot;feeds&quot; --- i.e., categories --- which contained\n&quot;items&quot; --- i.e., blogged or grazed metadata and annotations about blog items or\nexternal news articles.  The problem was that, because of a strict notion of\ncontainment, it was difficult for a single item to be in more than one feed.\nOur 2nd-gen architecture addressed this by separating the feedspace from the\nitemspace, making feedspace a richer, composable namespace which indirectly and\ndynamically provided views on itemspace.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
