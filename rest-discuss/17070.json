The result\nis a document which validates to its schema, with QC assurance of its\ninteroperability based on adherence to best current practices.  When\nyou mint a new data type, what toolchain exists to assure accessibility\nand validation to promote interoperability?  How many hours would it\ntake someone who&#39;s never looked at your representation before, to\nfigure it out let alone version it?  When folks start talking\nalternatives like WSDL, XSD and code generation, I shudder to think of\nall the added complexity brought to bear to solve a bunch of problems\nlong accounted for in HTML, preferring to actually *complete* projects.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
