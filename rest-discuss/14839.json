When the competition\nchanges to the evaluation phase, no mo=\r\nre changes are accepted in the\nhomeworks, so the method PUT and POST should=\r\n be &quot;disabled&quot; in the\nhomework resources.\n\n2) During the evaluation, the &quot;e=\r\nvaluators&quot; can apply grades to the\nhomeworks.. They can also review their g=\r\nrades. methods PUT, GET,\nDELETE and POST are available to the homework grad=\r\nes resource.\n\n3) When the competition finishes, it goes to the history phas=\r\ne, and no\nmore changes are acceptable in the homeworks (evaluation, patches=\r\n,\netc..). The resources supports only GET methods in this phase.\n\nNotice th=\r\nat I have two distinct workflows here:\n\n1) the resource workflow, where a c=\r\nhange in the resource produces its\nfeasible next states as side effects.\n2)=\r\n the application phases, where an external action (usually the\ncompetition =\r\nowner presses a button) changes the state of all resources\nregarding a comp=\r\netition.\n\nConsidering the competition also as a resource, I have a change i=\r\nn the\nstate of a competition with side effects in other resources. So it is=\r\n\nnot only a matter of changing the resource representation, but also to\nman=\r\nage the impact of that changing in other resources.\n\nI have an slide repres=\r\nenting this problem in this presentation:\nhttp://www.jfokus.se/jfokus/preso=\r\n/jf-10_DomainDrivenRESTWeb-Services.pdf\n\nPlease let me know if this problem=\r\n is suitable for your discussion.\n\nI have also some code implemented about =\r\nthat, like:\n\n------------- load competitions:\n\nXML/JSON: http://fgaucho.dyn=\r\ndns.org:8080/arena-http/competition\nJSONP: http://fgaucho.dyndns.org:8080/a=\r\nrena-http/competition/jsonp\n\n------------- load homeworks:\n\nXML/JSON: http:=\r\n//fgaucho.dyndns.org:8080/arena-http/homework?competition=3DPUJCE-09\nJSONP:=\r\n http://fgaucho.dyndns.org:8080/arena-http/homework/jsonp?competition=3DPUJ=\r\nCE-09\n\n* if you don&#39;t include the &#39;competition&#39; parameter, it will load all=\r\n homeworks.\n\nand I have also some write operations implemented..\n\nIt is con=\r\nsumed by clients like:\n\nhttp://fgaucho.dyndns.org:8080/arena-dwr/\nhttp://fg=\r\naucho.dyndns.org:8080/arena-jsf20\n\nthe code is fully available from here:\n\n=\r\nhttp://kenai.com/projects/puj/pages/Arena-dev\n\nbut it is still a work in pr=\r\nogress... so be nice to tell me the missed points :)\n\nregards,\n\n=A0 Felipe =\r\nGa=FAcho\n\n\n\n\nOn Sun, Feb 21, 2010 at 10:14 AM, Markus Karg &lt;markus.karg@gmx=\r\n.net&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Tatu,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; no doubt about that. If you business demands s=\r\ntoring a resource, REST will\n&gt; not prevent you from doing so. But as you sa=\r\nid, then this is because of it&#39;s\n&gt; resource state, not of it&#39;s conversation=\r\nal state. The conversational state\n&gt; still must not get stored on the serve=\r\nr. So for sake of clarity, let&#39;s not\n&gt; further use the carts example, as it=\r\n would mislead readers. We should fina\n&gt; an example where undoubtful the co=\r\nnversation state will never get part of\n&gt; the resource state just be redefi=\r\nnitio of the business scenario. ;-)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards\n&gt;\n&gt; Markus\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; From=\r\n: Tatu Saloranta [mailto:tsaloranta@...]\n&gt; Sent: Samstag, 20.

But I think it is an interesting case to consider -- I am sure that\n&gt;=\r\n persistency (and thus statefulness) of resources is a must for many system=\r\ns.\n&gt; And that it is necessary to separate resource state with session/trans=\r\naction\n&gt; state. I don&#39;t think REST would preclude former, but at this point=\r\n I would\n&gt; not be entirely surprised to be convinced otherwise. :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; Act=\r\nually come to think of that, I can see why someone might think of\n&gt; shoppin=\r\ng cart as conversation state... and others as more of a resource. I\n&gt; guess=\r\n that is modeling choice really.\n&gt; And also a practical thing: if it is par=\r\nt of conversation, you can have\n&gt; multiple concurrent sessions (open a new =\r\nbrowser window, get a different\n&gt; cart); or just a single shared one per ac=\r\ncount.\n&gt;\n&gt; FWIW, for retailers like Amazon this is obviously a must feature=\r\n; not just\n&gt; shopping cart but wish lists and such. Although it is good to =\r\nget immediate\n&gt; sales, probability of a later purchase is probably high (I =\r\ndon&#39;t know the\n&gt; ratio, nor could divulge if I did -- this is just inferred=\r\n from public\n&gt; information :) ).\n&gt;\n&gt; -+ Tatu +-\n&gt;\n\n\n\n--\n-------------------=\r\n-----------------------\n=A0 Felipe Ga=FAcho\n=A0 10+ Java Programmer\n=A0 CEJ=\r\nUG Senior Advisor\n\n\n\n-- \n------------------------------------------\n   Feli=\r\npe Ga=FAcho\n   10+ Java Programmer\n   CEJUG Senior Advisor\n\n"}}
