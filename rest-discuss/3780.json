Menus, etc. You can use PUT. Remember GET retrieves a\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;representation\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;of the resource. If the PUT is text/plain and the GET has an accept:\n&gt;&gt;text/plain header, you could assume that the user wants the editable\n&gt;&gt;version of the page and not the rendered version.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;But here&#39;s the question -- is the page with all that UI cruft\n&gt;surrounding\n&gt;the central content really just another &quot;representation&quot; of that\n&gt;content? I\n&gt;can easily accept the original Wiki text and its HTML rendering as two\n&gt;representations of the same content resource, but the extra stuff put\n&gt;around\n&gt;it (menus, logos, search forms, last-modified notations, etc.) doesn&#39;t\n&gt;feel\n&gt;like part of the same resource.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nI would recommend treating your UI components as the resources rather \nthan treating them as just another representation of the content. I say \nthis in part because browsers dont support PUT or DELETE, but also \nbecause you end up jumping through hoops for anything more than the \nsimplest of UIs.\n\nFor example (off the top of my head), a user management system might \nhave as resources /app/usercreator (a create screen), \n/app/usereditor?uid=x (an edit screen), and /app/userviewer?uid=x (a \nview screen).  The resource is then the UI component.  You can still \nmake users first-class resources (give the URIs) - but you would still \npass the URI in to the UI component resource \n(/app/usereditor?user=/app/users/foo).\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n\n"}}
