IOW, the application flow *might* follow some pre-supposed state machine, but it also *might not*. Server and client simply cannot agree on this at design time - or it&#39;s not REST.\n\nHowever, - and this is what Ian is IMHO trying to capture with his term &#39;DAP&#39; - media types do not fall from the sky at random but are designed on the basis of some set of interactions the designers think about when they create the media type. Clearly, when you design a media type for procurement you will have some basic interactions in mind.\n\nJim Webber, IIRC, has called this &#39;canonical application&#39; which I personally think makes it more explicit that there are also many, many other applications that can be created on the basis of a given media type. I have also thought of &#39;canonical use case&#39;.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nJan\n\n\n\n&gt; I mean, something like slide #5 and #6 of Ian Robinson&#39;s slides:\n&gt; http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2877247/Domain%20Application%20Protocols%20-%20JFokus.pdf\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Nadalin Alessandro\n&gt; www.odino.org\n&gt; www.twitter.com/_odino_\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
