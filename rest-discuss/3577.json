Cookies aren&#39;t the state, they&#39;re &quot;receipts&quot; for the state.\ne.g. if you login to a web site using cookies, your browser just gets an\nopaque string which represents your login information.  It&#39;s your login\ninfo which is the state.  Subsequent interactions are called &quot;stateful&quot;\nbecause the meaning of the message depends upon state which is not\npresent in the message, requiring parties wanting to process those\nmessages to already know how to lookup the login/password info given\nthe cookie.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.
