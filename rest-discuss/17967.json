This resonates with the problem Eric wrote abou=\r\nt:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; dynamically passing a declarative description of constraints on all=\r\nowed\n&gt;&gt; &gt; values for expansion. In your example, you communicate a list of\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; possible contexts for expansion. A context is a set of value for\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nperforming a given expansion. Do I understand correctly? If so, I&#39;m not\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; sure why you don&#39;t directly pass to the client a list of URI generated\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; server-side by expanding the &quot;templates&quot; using the various contexts? I&#39;m=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Well, that surely *is* an option as I mentioned myself, but if you g=\r\no\n&gt;&gt; this path, then you don&#39;t need to provide the client with uri-template=\r\ns\n&gt;&gt; nor contexts, and you don&#39;t need anything else then the xhtml we alrea=\r\ndy\n&gt;&gt; have...\n&gt;&gt; So I just assumed you meant this, if not it seemed to make=\r\n your question\n&gt;&gt; void?\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, I need client side expansion, as I want to=\r\n use URI templates to dynamically communicate how to build certain URIs. Ho=\r\nwever, my clients are purpose-built programs whose developers will be given=\r\n some informations out of band. For example, I might communicate http://exa=\r\nmple.com/stockquote/{symbol} dynamically, associated with a given rel value=\r\n for finding it in a representation, but specify in my service documentatio=\r\nn (i.e., out of band) that it must be expanded using a variable named &quot;symb=\r\nol&quot; whose value must be the stock symbol of the company you want a stock qu=\r\note for.\n&gt;\n&gt; So my main question is what you labeled as &quot;question [1]&quot;: wha=\r\nt is the best way to embed such an URI template in XHTML.\n&gt;\n&gt; One viable op=\r\ntion is =A0creating a specific &quot;link&quot; element with a rel and hreft attribut=\r\ne, which would give:\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;html xmlns=3D&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; xmlns=\r\n:my=3D&quot;http://example.com/my&quot;&gt;\n&gt; =A0 =A0&lt;body&gt;\n&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0&lt;my:link re=\r\nl=3D&quot;http://example.com/rels/stockquote&quot; hreft=3D&quot;http://example.com/stockq=\r\nuote/{symbol}&quot; /&gt;\n&gt; =A0 =A0&lt;/body&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/html&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Another idea I have is to =\r\nuse the existing xrd&#39;s link element, which has support for URI templates (x=\r\nrd is specified at http://docs.oasis-open.org/xri/xrd/v1.0/xrd-1.0.html).\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; This would give:\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;html xmlns=3D&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; xmlns:=\r\nxrd=3D&quot;http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/xri/xrd-1.0&quot;&gt;\n&gt; =A0 =A0&lt;body&gt;\n&gt; =A0 =\r\n=A0 =A0 =A0&lt;xrd:link rel=3D&quot;http://example.com/rels/stockquote&quot; template=3D=\r\n&quot;http://example.com/stockquote/{symbol}&quot; /&gt;\n&gt; =A0 =A0&lt;/body&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/html&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nI&#39;d be grateful for any feedback on these as well as other ideas on how to =\r\nbest use URI templates as hypermedia controls in XHTML.\n&gt;\n&gt; Philippe\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
