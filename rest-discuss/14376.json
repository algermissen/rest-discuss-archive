I have personally never\n&gt; felt the need to map my uniform methods to another communications\n&gt; protocol - is anyone really doing that?  I gathered that was true for\n&gt; you as well since your examples continue to be APP which is itself\n&gt; HTTP-based.\n&gt; \n\nYeah, I&#39;m giving an HTTP example.  I almost posted, but erased, a file-\nupload system which takes the generic interfaces of FTP and HTTP and\ncombines them into a uniform RESTish interface (minus the hypertext\nconstraint, of course) by assigning &#39;create&#39; to FTP PUT and &#39;replace&#39;\nto HTTP PUT.  Just because you&#39;re using HTTP&#39;s generic interface\ndoesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re building a uniform REST interface.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ... REST requires that hypertext be used to make these\n&gt; &gt; instructions to the client explicit, so Atom Protocol has a REST\n&gt; &gt; mismatch.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve never seen such a requirement and it&#39;s not clear how that\n&gt; resolves with Roy&#39;s comment below?\n&gt; \n\nThe requirement is called the hypertext constraint.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;HTTP operations are generic: they are allowed or not, per resource,\n&gt; but they are always valid. Hypertext doesn’t usually tell you all the\n&gt; operations allowed on any given resource; it tells you which operation\n&gt; to use for each potential transition.&quot;\n&gt; \n\nPutting on my Roy Decoder Ring, and using my Atom Protocol example --\nyou dereference a resource, which allows GET, PUT, POST, PATCH and\nDELETE.  But, due to your role, the representation you receive may only\ntell you about GET and POST operations you may use for each potential\ntransition.  DELETE is always there in the HTTP generic interface, but\nit only becomes part of a uniform REST interface if the client is told\nof the potential DELETE transition using hypertext.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
