Just a \n&gt; representation of that resource.\n\nYes. But an app might expect that it could get an authoritative\nresource representation.\n\n\n&gt; So what you&#39;re saying is that if my application requires sessions, I&#39;m \n&gt; out of luck with REST.  Does that leave me back at SOAP, or can I get \n&gt; some of the REST benefits while still having sessions?\n\nREST isn&#39;t an API. It&#39;s just a way of doing things so yes, of course\nyou can pick and choose.\n\n\n&gt;&gt; One big win is the scalability achieved through cachability. One big\n&gt;&gt; loss is that session less apps seem harder to grasp; probably because\n&gt;&gt; programming in the small (like my earlier JSP example) is so easy to\n&gt;&gt; do.\n&gt;&gt;   \n&gt; I certainly appreciate there are many wonderful sessionless apps that \n&gt; can be created.  But suppose I already know the requirements of my app, \n&gt; and that includes sessions.  Are you saying there is always some way to \n&gt; do the same thing with a sessionless app?  Or are you saying I should \n&gt; abandon REST if I need sessions?\n\nAs long as you can use client side interactivity (xslt, javascript,\netc...) there is *always* a way to do an app without a session-object.\n\n\nAnd that&#39;s what the REST argument is about. We argue that it&#39;s better\nto store state in resources that are directly exposed via HTTP because\nthe resulting apps are more scalable and fit better with the existing\nhypertext model of the web. \n\nOther people argue that sessions based architecture is better because\nthe web is really a big network with RPC clients and servers all over\nthe place.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
