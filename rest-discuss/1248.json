Does anyone have any Java implementation \n&gt; experience to share?\n\nIn my experience, the Servlet APIs, now part of Jakarta, provide an\nexcellent framework for RESTful app development.\n\n&gt; 2) The SOAP proponents at work are proposing the use of Apache Axis \n&gt; as a SOAP server implementation. Does anyone have experience with \n&gt; Axis?\n\nI&#39;ve looked at the APIs, but haven&#39;t used it.  From what I can see,\nit&#39;s pretty much the same as any other SOAP API out there; difficult\nto use in a REST based environment where you&#39;re using other HTTP\nmethods and features at the same time.\n\n&gt; 3) The SOAP proponents think the extensible SOAP header adds \n&gt; flexibility, a place to put transaction metadata or security related \n&gt; information. Does REST have an answer to these requirements?\n\nHeaders.  HTTP headers, in the case of HTTP.\n\n&gt; 4) We need a way for an external application to store or modify a \n&gt; trade in our application. I would be interested in any feedback on \n&gt; the following resource modeling ideas:\n[snip]\n&gt; Or perhaps do it in one step:\n&gt;  -&gt; HTTP POST request containing trade XML\n[snip]\n&gt;       or //host/trades\n&gt; \n&gt;  &lt;- HTTP response would contain server-generated URI:\n&gt;          //host/trades/123\n\nI like that one.\n\n&gt; 4b) To modify an existing trade:\n&gt;  -&gt; HTTP PUT request containing trade XML\n&gt;       to //host/trades/122\n&gt; \n&gt;  &lt;- HTTP response indicating success\n\nRight.\n\n&gt; 4c) To read an existing trade:\n&gt;  -&gt; HTTP GET request\n&gt;       to //host/trades/122\n&gt; \n&gt;  &lt;- HTTP response containing trade XML\n\nRight again.\n\n&gt; 4d) Within a trade XML instance some information would be represented \n&gt; as a link to the resource containing the complete information. For \n&gt; example:\n&gt; \n&gt;   &lt;trade&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;counterparty href=&quot;https//host/counterparties/12&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;broker href=&quot;https//host/brokers/34&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;     ...\n&gt;   &lt;/trade&gt;\n\nExactly.  You don&#39;t have to use &quot;href&quot; though; you can use your own\nlinking system, or XLink, or RDF.\n\n&gt; 5) Given the requirements outlined in (4), which would you recommend: \n&gt; the REST approach above, or the use of SOAP with an API containing \n&gt; methods such as, storeTrade(tradeXml), modifyTrade(tradeXml), getTrade\n&gt; ().\n\nYou have to ask? 8-)\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO             Idokorro Mobile Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.         distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca  http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
