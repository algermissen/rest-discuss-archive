It just means &quot;state=off&quot;, and the server is\n&gt; &gt;  free to do what it wants with &quot;temp&quot;.  At least, that&#39;s how I\n&gt; &gt;  understand it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is that right? I think it is, as long as the media type allows GET\n&gt; requests to respond with\n&gt;\n&gt;   HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n&gt;   Content-Type: application/lightbulb+xml\n&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;bulb&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;state&gt;off&lt;/state&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;/bulb&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; if the the protocol /expects/ that &lt;temp&gt; will be re-inserted by the\n&gt; server, that&#39;s a little different, because it would require relatively\n&gt; detailed knowledge of the media type in order accept a PUT request,\n&gt; right?\n\nSounds right.\n\n&gt; Is it OK to extend PUT by requiring servers to re-insert fields\n&gt; required by a schema?\n\nHmm.  Why would that need to be part of the protocol?  As long as the\nclient understands the media type and the meaning of PUT, and the\nrepresentation contains sufficient information for PUT to be\nperformed, wouldn&#39;t all be well?\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
