As you yourself agree, there are at least\n&gt; two other semantics:  comparison (a form of deconstruction) and construction\n&gt; from relative URI.  So URI do *not* only support dereference;  it is\n&gt; necessary to look at the contents of the URI string in some contexts to gain\n&gt; the information necessary to use them the way they need to be used.\n&gt; \n&gt; .:, URI are not opaque in any sense consistent with the Axiom, and perhaps\n&gt; not opaque in any meaningful sense.\n\nIf you read the whole document, Tim BL quotes both of these\n&quot;exceptions&quot;. A more formal exposition would put all of the things you\ncan do with URIs together. But I&#39;ve always read the document as &quot;URIs\nare opaque with the exceptions listed in this document.&quot; My concern is\nthat we not present these &quot;exceptions&quot; as evidence that the dam is\nleaking and therefore why not let all of the water in? A simple\neditorial change on Tim BLs part could turn those &quot;exceptions&quot; into just\nclearly described things you ARE allowed to do with URIs.\n\n&quot;The only thing you can use an identifier for is to refer to an object.\nWhen you are not dereferencing, comparing or constructing absolute URIs\nfrom relative ones, you should not look at the contents of the URI\nstring to gain other information...&quot;\n\n&gt; Despite this, you and I share and agree on an &quot;intuitive&quot; definition of\n&gt; &quot;opacity&quot; that we believe is desirable for URI.  A better way to put this,\n&gt; rather than calling it &quot;opacity,&quot; would be:  URI do NOT have any implicit\n&gt; semantics.  All operations and semantics on URI *must* be explicitly\n&gt; specified.  I would even go further and say that these semantics must not\n&gt; only be explicit, they must be universal within a given URI scheme.  In this\n&gt; sense, I perhaps advocate &quot;opacity&quot; (really, its intent) even more strongly\n&gt; than you.\n\nIf you want to make the level of opacity a scheme-specific &quot;property&quot;\nthat&#39;s okay with me. I&#39;m pretty much the most hard-line HTTP scheme\nbigot anyhow.\n\nDo you and I also agree that the specification for HTTP URIs does not\nallow you to infer that given:\n\nhttp://x.com/foo/bar\n\nthat there is a resource &quot;http://x.com/foo&quot;?\n\n&gt;...\n&gt;...\n&gt; Sure, such rejection is &quot;safe&quot; --- if we assume just those three operations,\n&gt; we can be sure that programs that use just those operations work correctly.\n&gt; And this is a good thing.  In general, constraints are a good thing --- the\n&gt; Web gains much of its power through its constraining mechanisms.  However,\n&gt; constraints should not be arbitrary, and IMO rejecting the possibility of\n&gt; additional explicit / universal semantics for URI is just such an\n&gt; unacceptable, arbitrary constraint.  By itself, the existence of the\n&gt; so-called Axiom is not sufficient to reject the possibility that other\n&gt; universal and useful semantics might be explicitly specified at some point.\n\nOkay, I can agree to that. But it&#39;s very different than giving people\nthe advice that they should just do what they feel like when it comes to\nopacity. Until someone, somewhere defines other universal operators for\nURIs, as far as I know the only operations available are {deref,\ncompare, construct-relative}. So for now, opacity &quot;you shouldn&#39;t do\nother stuff with URIs, or at least HTTP URIs.&quot;\n\nAnd of course there is an ambigious &quot;you&quot; in the formulation. &quot;You&quot;\ncannot include the entity (usually a server) responsible for mapping\nfrom URIs to real resources.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; PS - one other important bit.  It&#39;s important to distinguish between HTTP\n&gt; URI and URI in general.  The Axiom of Opacity is intended to apply to all\n&gt; URI, not just HTTP-scheme URI.  And while it may (or may not) be desirable\n&gt; to ignore the hierarchical semantics of the path part of an HTTP URI, it&#39;s\n&gt; ***NOT*** the case that this is desirable in all conceivable URI schemes.\n&gt; Filesystem related schemes like smb:// and nfs:// absolutely *require* that\n&gt; clients of those protocols be able to deconstruct and comprehend URI\n&gt; according to their hierarchical structure.  \n\nWe disagree on whether these non-REST resources are first-class parts of\n&quot;the Web&quot; but that is the sort of argument that will never terminate for\nlack of clear definitions.\n-- \nCome discuss XML and REST web services at:\n  Open Source Conference: July 22-26, 2002, conferences.oreillynet.com\n  Extreme Markup: Aug 4-9, 2002,  www.extrememarkup.com/extreme/\n\n"}}
