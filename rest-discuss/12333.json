Media types that capture information\nspecific to a &quot;domain object&quot; are a premature optimization.  If you have a\n&quot;movie&quot; media type, and an &quot;actor&quot; media type, you&#39;ve literally optimized\nthe HATEOAS out of it (pardon my French).  You might be able to get from a\n&quot;movie&quot; to it&#39;s &quot;actors&quot; and back again.  However, how can you get from a\n&quot;movie&quot; or an &quot;actor&quot; to the &quot;movie search&quot; or the &quot;My Queue&quot; application\nstates?  That kind of problem becomes so unwieldy across the set of\nindividualized media types to the point that HATEOAS gets ignored.\n\nIn a generic media type, like my proposed &quot;API-ML&quot;, you can also specify a\nmovie and actor.  However, you&#39;d get lose the localized performance of a\nmore targeted media type.  On the other hand, using a more generic markup\nlanguange allows you to add a hypertext reference from the movie resource to\nan &quot;actor&quot; resource/application state or just as easily to the &quot;movie\nsearch&quot; and &quot;My Queue&quot; application states.\n\nIMHO, a generic API ML will inherently reduce performance for individual\nrequests, but will optimize &quot;conversations.&quot;\n\n-Solomon\n\nOn Fri, Mar 27, 2009 at 4:02 PM, Bill Burke &lt;bburke@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Solomon Duskis wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Fri, Mar 27, 2009 at 11:22 AM, Bill Burke &lt;bburke@... &lt;mailto:\n&gt;&gt; bburke@...&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    I was thinking about this  alot more last night.  I&#39;m not sure you\n&gt;&gt;    need this type of markup language.  Computers aren&#39;t humans.  While\n&gt;&gt;    a human can look at a web page and figure out how to enter\n&gt;&gt;    information on the form there, a piece of code can&#39;t.  For code,\n&gt;&gt;    everything needs to be mostly predetermined and the interactions\n&gt;&gt;    agreed upon before hand.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Specific Interactions do need some predetermined flows, but the specifics\n&gt;&gt; of the communication (i.e. here&#39;s the URL, and here&#39;s the headers for\n&gt;&gt; content-type...) don&#39;t need to be.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Also, there are plenty of companies that built empires based on knowing\n&gt;&gt; how to crawl HTML.  In other words, with a ML, a piece of code can figure\n&gt;&gt; out how to do some pretty interesting aggregation.  For example, let&#39;s say\n&gt;&gt; an enterprise has a whole bunch of semi-interconnected APIs based on this\n&gt;&gt; ML.  I can conceive of a central API aggregator that crawls those APIs and\n&gt;&gt; creates a dynamic registry of available functionality.  There can be a whole\n&gt;&gt; bunch of interesting applications once we &quot;engineer for serendipity.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; And I&#39;m saying tht serendipity exists in the media type already.  You don&#39;t\n&gt; need to send it with the message.  When you send around XML documents to you\n&gt; embed the schema?  Or do you just link to it?  Or define a new mime type?\n&gt;  Answer?
