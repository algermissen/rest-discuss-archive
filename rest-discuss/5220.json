It tells the system to contact the\n&gt; device to obtain its state but it does not return the state. Another URL\n&gt; is available to retrieve (parts of) the state. The operation described\n&gt; in the example here (i.e. DownloadDeviceData) does not return any data\n&gt; other than a result indicating if the acquisition was succesful or\n&gt; not.\n&gt; \n[hvw] Oops. That&#39;s a bad operation for GET, because the GET has the side\neffect of changing the state of another resource (the one where you get the\nactual state). DownloadDeviceData seems like a job for POST.\n\n..Snip... \n&gt; Similarly, in the acquisition context, I could do:\n&gt; \n&gt;   http://server/acquisition/ID as POST would acquire data\n&gt;   http://server/acquisition/ID as GET would be same as POST\n[hvw] GET must not be same as POST, see above. Jan&#39;s suggestion was pretty\ngood. If you model the device as the resource, POSTing to the device URI\ncould mean &quot;Download Device Data&quot;.\n\nhttp://server/device/ID POST would acquire data\nhttp://server/device/ID GET would get the device state (if I understand\ncorrectly)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n"}}
