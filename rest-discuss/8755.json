He was smarter than me, so I&#39;ll tentatively\nbelieve it.\n\nCompensation is extremely difficult in many (maybe most) cases.  Can\nyou really undo all of the effects of a set of distributed actions?\n\nAnother pattern exists that is 2PC but not ACID, variously called\nProvisional-Final, Tentative Business Operations (by Pat Helland), or\nEscrow.\n\nDoes not require compensation or holding locks across phases.\n\nBasic idea is that in the first phase, you update resources\nprovisionally (implementation cd be a separate entity).  Then in the\n2nd phase, if the transaction commits, update finally (update final\nentity, e.g. &quot;real&quot; resource).  Or if the transaction cancels, delete\nthe provisional entity.\n\nIn REST, probably uses a separate transaction resource, or at least\nthat&#39;s true of all the RESTful transaction proposals I&#39;ve seen on this\nlist or in the recent book.\n\nI don&#39;t know why Helland opposes this pattern to 2PC, because it is\n2PC, just not ACID.\n\nProbably other patterns cd be found that are 2PC but not ACID, that wd\nalso work RESTfully.\n\n"}}
