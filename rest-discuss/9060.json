Lots of competing proposals, but all of \nthem are simple-matter-of-coding once you&#39;ve decided to do them.\n\nThere are a lot of threads where we are talking about ideals. Talking \nabout ideals has its place. You can&#39;t compromise unless you know what \nyou are compromising between (the ideal and the possible).\n\n &gt; 1.  Authentication. Far as I can tell, all the options that are both \nRESTful and secure require something more than vanilla Web 0.1, and so \nI&#39;m stuck with Apache Basic Auth or something cookie-based.\n\nDigest?\n\n &gt; I think I&#39;m going to go with the latter, because being able to log \nout is pretty important, I think.\n\nYou can do that with Basic or Digest. Would be nice if we didn&#39;t have to \ndo the hacky trick that&#39;s necessary with almost every browser (Lynx is \nthe only one I can think of that has a proper log-out option by default).\n\n &gt; Tentatively, I&#39;d go with a scheme wherein there&#39;s a login form with a \nusername/password, host returns a username/session token. A bit \nRESTless, but nothing beyond the token itself is stored in the \nserver-side session, so I&#39;m thinking the damage to RESTfulness is minimal.\n\nPretty heavy damage in most cases. This is a big scalability crippler in \nmany systems.\n\n &gt; So is security, but it&#39;s better than transmitting the password in the \nclear every time. Slightly.\n\nSecurity with these schemes is at best dependant upon you getting every \nright (assuming yet another problem with cookie security isn&#39;t found).\n\nThe only reason for using cookie-based security is one is busy and lots \nof toolkits come with built-in support. It&#39;s perfectly reasonable for a \ndeveloper to make that call IMO, but pretty crappy of the toolkits to \nhave that flaw. I blame the toolkits, but not the developer.\n\n &gt; 2.  That darn &quot;there&#39;s something beyond GET and POST?&quot; thing. I&#39;m \npretty much stuck with overloaded POST, I think. Happily, the \napplication I&#39;m writing is naturally heavier on true POSTs than PUTs, at \nleast. And I&#39;m not at all clear on what horrible things can happen \n(again, in *practice*) with overloaded POST, at least in an environment \nwhere dumb browser is constrained (barring malice/stupidity) by the \nforms fed to it by a server aware of its dumbness.\n\nPOST for everything is suboptimal rather than wrong.\n\n &gt; I&#39;ll save the &quot;And now I want to implement REST via SMTP!&quot;\n\nMy first question on that score is &quot;why?&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
