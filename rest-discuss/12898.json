Neither &quot;?&quot; nor &quot;#&quot; belong to\n&gt;  &gt; the HTTP layer. Those are part of RFC 3986, and the fact that browsers\n&gt;  &gt; don&#39;t send the part of the URI after the &quot;#&quot; separator to servers is\n&gt;  &gt; dictated by the media type (primarily the HTML family).\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; [...]\n&gt; I am not sure what you are saying, other than that you are saying \n&gt; incorrect information. There is URIs mentioned in the HTTP spec, and \n&gt; there is the HTTP URI scheme. The HTTP URI scheme does not say anything \n&gt; about fragment identifiers.\n\nThat&#39;s what Subbu is trying to tell you - how to dispatch on a fragid is \ndefined by the media type not the transfer protocol or URI processing.\n\nFragment identifiers are broken as designed in the web architecture. As \nwe say in Ireland, I wouldn&#39;t start from there.\n\n\n&gt; Likewise, you will note in the practical sense of &quot;what to expect in \n&gt; real world implementations&quot;, that Search Engines do not index content \n&gt; after the #. This imposes a real world practical limitation on real \n&gt; world use. However, Google killing the question mark is huge. This kind \n&gt; of opens the door, just a crack, about the idea of Google having to \n&gt; require its Sitemap technology be able to understand fragment \n&gt; identifiers. In hypermedia theory, this means we can finally start \n&gt; building Web applications with &quot;open linking&quot; and &quot;deep linking&quot;.\n\nSince you&#39;re say you&#39;re coming from this from a practical angle, I would \nsay it means user agents will need to know a lot more about media types \nthan they do today, which is a very real form of coupling. Probably that \nwill get pushed up to application developers.\n\n\n&gt; I guess I am just using REST to build real applications and not simply \n&gt; writing about REST for the sake of writing about it. I&#39;m not a client \n&gt; looking for stuff to stick in a PowerPoint presentation to show my boss.\n\nYou don&#39;t need to justify yourself here. Unfortunately this is a detail \nof the web&#39;s implementation/specs more than REST canon.\n\nBill\n\n"}}
