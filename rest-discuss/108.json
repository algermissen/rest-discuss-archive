A response looks like a request, but without the first line - the\n&gt; method and resource.\n\nNo no, because what I&#39;m talking about doesn&#39;t have the request line, just\nthe headers (unencapsulated) and body.  So content-type would be like\napplication/xml, or whatever.  Not message/http.\n\n&gt; And with good enough access to the lower levels of HTTP, using chunked\n&gt; encoding with each discrete message within the response might work.\n&gt; \n&gt; I haven&#39;t followed this out to look at encoding issues or at multi-hop\n&gt; (proxies) issues. But it sounds fun anyway.\n\nWe have at PF.  Lots of fun.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
