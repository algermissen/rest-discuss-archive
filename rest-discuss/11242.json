Maybe I should just leave it\n&gt;&gt; &quot;decide which kinds of resources you want to expose&quot;, but I was\n&gt;&gt; wondering whether this &quot;kind&quot; thing merits its own term.\n&gt;\n&gt; Isn&#39;t the whole point that it does not make sense to say &#39;kinds of\n&gt; resources&#39;? Talking about kinds of resources is misleading because\n&gt; grouping the resources before dereferencing them is infromation that\n&gt; the user of the facade shoud not have and should not need.\n\nI&#39;m curious what the assembled minds think about quotes like this from AtomPub:\n\n&quot;A Resource whose IRI is listed in a Collection is called a Member\nResource. The protocol defines two kinds of Member Resources -- Entry\nResources and Media Resources. Entry Resources are represented as Atom\nEntry Documents [RFC4287]. Media Resources can have representations in\nany media type. A Media Resource is described within a Collection\nusing an Entry called a Media Link Entry.&quot;\n\n&quot;The Atom Protocol defines Collection Resources for managing and\norganizing both kinds of Member Resource. A Collection is represented\nby an Atom Feed Document. A Collection Feed&#39;s Entries contain the IRIs\nof, and metadata about, the Collection&#39;s Member Resources. &quot;\n\n&quot;The Atom Protocol only covers the creating, editing, and deleting of\nEntry and Media Resources.&quot;\n\n&quot;To list the Members of a Collection, the client sends a GET request\nto the URI of a Collection.&quot;\n\nAs another example, isn&#39;t an OpenSearch search engine also a resource type?\n\nI feel I&#39;m misunderstanding something when people say that resources\ndo not and should not have types.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
