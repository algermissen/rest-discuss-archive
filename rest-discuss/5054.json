RDF Forms is used in a manner similar to an HTML form in th=\r\nat\n   they are obtained at &quot;runtime&quot; in order to construct an actual\n   req=\r\nuest at a particular URI.  WRDL on the other hand, \n   (while still obtaina=\r\nble using a GET) is more geared towards \n   declaring the entire service in=\r\nterface before hand.\n\n   Actually then, they could be used together.\n\n   If=\r\n both were used to describe a particular service, the \n   WRDL would be dec=\r\nlared to return an RDF Form with the GET,\n   and presumably the WRDL would =\r\nalso declare the same type\n   of representation/document that the RDF Form =\r\nwould \n   construct for a POST and GET query string.  In that regard\n   the=\r\nre would be some overlap.\n\n   Are these statements accurate?\n\n2. With WRDL =\r\nit is possible to specify multiple possible \n   document types that could b=\r\ne submitted with POST.\n  \n   Is it possible to declare an RDF Form that all=\r\nows multiple\n   document types?  E.g., the ability to submit a Book or a\n  =\r\n CD representation to an Order resource?\n\n3. Is there a way to define a PUT=\r\n operation in RDF Forms?\n   \n[1] http://www.markbaker.ca/2003/05/RDF-Forms/=\r\n\n[2] http://www.prescod.net/rest/wrdl/wrdl.html\n\n"}}
