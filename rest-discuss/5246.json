An example thread begins at \nhttp://zgp.org/pipermail/p2p-hackers/2005-August/002915.html \n\np2p-hackers: Tyler Close&#39; method for HTTP access control using nothing \nbut unguessable (and secret) URIs came up on REST-discuss.  That thread \nbegins at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/5228  In \nthe context of friendnets, Tyler&#39;s scheme is a beautifully simple way of \ncontrolling access using nothing but low-tech means.  Not only does it \nlimit access to trusted parties, it also allows for transitive \nrelationships.  (Warning: his scheme is counterintuitive, since the \ndependence on secret URLs smells like security through obscurity).\n\nI don&#39;t mean to create a permathread out of out of this cc:list, rather \nto refer interested rest-discuss people to p2p-hackers and vice versa.  \nIf you reply to this, please choose one list or the other as the \nrecipient. \n\nI&#39;ve always been surprised that the intersection of REST and \ncapabilities isn&#39;t a common theme, since both REST and capabilities \nrevolve around precisely defined relationships.  The success of defining \nHTTP methods in terms of privileges is due, I believe, to the way that \nit reflects the same underlying truth that capabilities formalize.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
