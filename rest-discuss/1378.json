Costello wrote:\n&gt;I think that I understand the REST abstraction of an HTTP GET:  A\n&gt;resource is an abstraction of a concept.  How the resource is\n&gt;implemented is encapsulated.  When a client issues an HTTP GET the\n&gt;client receives a representation of the resource.  Correct?\n\nYes, but interestingly HTTP allows a partial retrieval by the use of the \nRange header field, which would be useful if the resource was a collection \nof some sort.\n\n\n&gt;Is this the intended abstraction for an HTTP POST: the client\n&gt;sends to the resource a partial representation of the resource, which it\n&gt;expects the resource to incorporate into itself.  Is that the REST\n&gt;abstraction for an HTTP POST?\n\nPOST adds additional sub-resources to an existing resource, e.g. \nannotations, chat-style messages, database appends.\n\n&quot;The actual function performed by the POST method is determined by the \nserver and is usually dependent on the Request-URI. The posted entity is \nsubordinate to that URI in the same way that a file is subordinate to a \ndirectory containing it, a news article is subordinate to a newsgroup to \nwhich it is posted, or a record is subordinate to a database. &quot;\n\n\n&gt;And what is the abstraction with an HTTP PUT?  Is it that the client\n&gt;sends to the resource a new, complete representation of the resource\n&gt;which it expects the resource to replace itself with?  \n\nInterestingly (again), &quot;the PUT method SHOULD be considered as a modified \nversion of the one residing on the origin server&quot;, but it does not have to be. \n\nPUT can also result in the creation of a new resource &quot;If the Request-URI \ndoes not point to an existing resource, and that URI is capable of being \ndefined as a new resource by the requesting user agent&quot;\n\n&quot;The fundamental difference between the POST and PUT requests is reflected \nin the different meaning of the Request-URI. The URI in a POST request \nidentifies the resource that will handle the enclosed entity. That resource \nmay be a data-accepting process, a gateway to some other protocol, or a \nseparate entity that accepts annotations. In contrast, the URI in a PUT \nrequest identifies the entity enclosed with the request -- the user agent \nknows what URI is intended and the server MUST NOT attempt to apply the \nrequest to some other resource. &quot;\n\n\n&gt;Is the abstraction for an HTTP DELETE that the resource should\n&gt;completely delete itself?\n\n&quot;The DELETE method requests that the origin server delete the resource \nidentified by the Request-URI. This method MAY be overridden by human \nintervention (or other means) on the origin server. The client cannot be \nguaranteed that the operation has been carried out, even if the status code \nreturned from the origin server indicates that the action has been completed \nsuccessfully.&quot;\n\n\n&gt;In the three cases (POST, PUT, DELETE) it seems like the client is\n&gt;asking the resource to commit partial or complete suicide for the sake\n&gt;of the client&#39;s new representation.  \n\nNot true for POST, possibly true for PUT and DELETE.\n\n&gt;That doesn&#39;t seem to be a very\n&gt;reasonable thing to ask of a resource.\n\nDoesn&#39;t it depend on what the resource is and what the servers &#39;actual&#39; \ninterpretation of the method is?\n\n\nRobert\n\n\n"}}
