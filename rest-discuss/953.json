Try harder.  (Do you have any *substantive* criticism, or are we reduced to taking pot shots? ;-)\n\n&gt; And, in general, they are only reachable if somebody wants you to reach\n&gt; them.\n\nBut linking to them via hypertext is *explicitly* not the only means of making them available and communicating that\navailability.  Napkins, billboards, voice convo, e-mail, etc.\n\n&gt; The &quot;web way&quot; for them to express that is to give you either a\n&gt; hard-coded address or a hypertext document. Inventing a new way for\n&gt; describing sets of documents buys no new power, only complexity.\n\nI&#39;ve already given you many specific examples and general explanations.\n\n&gt; Once I type them in I defacto have a hyperlink.\n\nNo, you de facto have a URI.  A URI is not a hyperlink --- a URI embedded in hypertext is a hyperlink.  Whether you have\na hyperlink or not depends on whether it occurs in a recognizable hypertext.\n\n&gt; def natural_numbers(startpos, endpos):\n&gt;    for i in xrange(startpos, endpos):\n&gt;       print &quot;&lt;num&gt;%d&lt;/num&gt;&quot; % i\n&gt;\n&gt; Now you can &quot;address&quot; all of the natural numbers through this function.\n\nNo, I didn&#39;t say in some range, I said *all of them.*  (Hint:  it was a joke, Paul.  The point should be clear:  you\ncan&#39;t list an infinite set.)\n\n&gt; You don&#39;t have to enumerate them because you are only ever interested in\n&gt; a subset.\n\nBut the server cannot a priori know what subset I&#39;m interested in.  Therein lies the problem.  Consider a resource\nrepresenting the digits of pi.  I&#39;d like to be able to address specifically the digits of pi.  The ordinal position of a\ndigit of pi bears a subordinate, hierarchical relationship to the sequence of digits that make up pi.  I&#39;d like to be\nable to say\n\n    http://www.constants.com/pi/2036\n\nrather than\n\n    http://www.constants.com/pi?digit=2036\n\nWhy?  Because the meaning of the first is clearer by virtue of the use of the hierarchical path syntax, while the\nmeaning of the second is not as clear.  This is a bit of a weak example, because the first is not a *lot* clearer than\nthe second, but you get my drift.  At least, in the first example, the index *is* the namespace rather than being an\nadjunct to it.  Pi and pi&#39;s 2036th digit are both equally first-class entities, though the latter is &quot;subordinate&quot; to\nthe former.\n\n&gt; I feel like I&#39;m arguing with you about libertarianism.\n\nThis is a scientific and engineering discussion, not a political discussion.  At least it should be --- that&#39;s what I&#39;m\ntrying to keep it at.\n\n&gt; You aren&#39;t trying\n&gt; to solve a real problem that you&#39;ve experienced in practice, just trying\n&gt; to achieve a sort of hypertext-less purity.\n\nNo, I&#39;m trying to avoid cutting boards with hammers.  We have *two* powerful abstractions with the Web:  the URI\nnamespace and hypertext.  We should use them both.\n\n&gt; Well I&#39;m trying to achieve a\n&gt; hypertext-centric purity.\n\nSo here we have it --- you&#39;re the one with the political agenda, here.  The Web is undergoing a revisionist movement\ncalled &quot;The Semantic Web.&quot;  People have problems grokking namespaces, while everybody understands (some) graph theory.\nLet&#39;s get rid of the troublesome namespaces!  Problem is, there are things namespaces are good for that graphs are not.\n\n&gt; Having the Web be closed over hypertext makes\n&gt; it a much simpler information space. As you say, generative grammars\n&gt; don&#39;t handle anything either. Next we&#39;ll be shipping Javascript\n&gt; documents with the only goal of generating hyperlinks on the client\n&gt; side. That&#39;s powerful enough that we could do away with hyperlinks and\n&gt; generative grammars altogether.\n\nJavascript documents that generate hyperlinks would be a form of generative &quot;grammar&quot; or an equivalent generative\nsystem.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yes, but pushing hierarchical / graph-structure inormation into the flat space of query parameters *loses*\n&gt; &gt; information.  This is badness.  See the Wiki.\n&gt;\n&gt; No, it doesn&#39;t lose information. Queries generate *indexes* over\n&gt; hierarchical information space. The existence of the Google index does\n&gt; not destroy the hierarchy of MSDN, one of the things it may index.\n\nIt loses information *in the URI.*  This is clear.  Think about it.\n\n&gt; The relevant subsets of the information can be enumerated.\n\nAgain the problem is that the server cannot know a priori which subset is interesting, so it cannot be enumerated in\nhypertext, only indirectly represented via a partial name.  This name *can* be represented as a query string, at the\nexpense of losing information about the relationships between the query parameters and between those parameters and the\noverall information space being modeled.\n\n&gt; The Web has a way for them to provide that information to you. It is a\n&gt; hypertext index. Go to images.google.com. The Web way deals with both\n&gt; highly structured AND highly unstructured namespaces.\n\nIt also has a mechanism called &quot;URI&quot; that can be used to represent highly organized information spaces directly.\n\n&gt; You&#39;re an infospace designer. You have two options,\n\nNot an either-or choice, but one to be informed by the problem you&#39;re modeling.\n\n&gt; Generating the index on the server reifies it with a URI and generally\n&gt; builds on existing web infrastructure better.\n&gt; http://www.somefiles.com/images?subset=/1999/*/02\n\nThis is a good and noble goal, and should be pursued wherever possible.  Sometimes, though, these indices cannot be\nreified;  rather, the relevant information must be computed.  Generative naming works in this case;  hypertext per se\ndoes not.  In the case of generative naming, the namespace *is* the index.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
