I wrote vanilla XSLT 1.0 and only used MS extensions where XSLT 1.0\n&gt; was woefully inadequate.\n\nThat you used MS extensions suggest you really didn&#39;t get it. That you \nwere working with the MS XSLT in the first place suggests you had \nproblems you have improperly diagnosed, and you&#39;re assigning the blame \nto the wrong cause.\n\n\n&gt;&gt; XSLT is a pure functional language with no side effects. \n&gt; \n&gt; Pullease.  I&#39;d write XSLT for an XML document, and then another XML document\n&gt; that validates to the same schema would trigger differences in the XSLT\n&gt; transform; it would either break or produce output that I wasn&#39;t expecting.\n&gt; It was a nightmare to debug those situations and they happened over and\n&gt; over.\n\nThat&#39;s not a side effect. That&#39;s an indication of bad code. Properly \nwritten, XSLT can handle a wide variation of inputs. However testing and \ndebugging is as necessary as in any other software system. It&#39;s not magic.\n\n\n&gt;&gt; Whatever language you were working with it certainly doesn&#39;t \n&gt;&gt; sound like XSLT. It sounds like someone fed you a haggis for \n&gt;&gt; Christmas dinner, called it a turkey, and consequently you \n&gt;&gt; now think we&#39;re all crazy because we say we love turkey.\n&gt; \n&gt; Your annoying use of condescention given you really have no knowledge of my\n&gt; experience only reflects negatively on you.\n\nI&#39;m going by what you posted. But what you say continues to strongly \nsuggest that you encountered well known problems as a direct result of \nuse of non-standard Microsoft technologies.\n\n\n&gt; If you don&#39;t know them it&#39;s because you don&#39;t get out much.\n&gt; Google for JSON vs. XML and you&#39;ll find lots.\n\nAgain,you&#39;re misdiagnosing. XSLT is not the issue here. Even XML isn&#39;t \nreally the issue. It&#39;s DOM. You&#39;re seeing symptoms, but you&#39;re badly \nmisdiagnosing the causes.\n\n&gt; And here are two more XSLT-related blog posts I wrote from 2004: \n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.mikeschinkel.com/blog/rantingaboutxsltsverbosity/\n&gt; http://www.mikeschinkel.com/blog/goodxslttutorial/\n\nHmm, the second one seems to include quite a bit of non-standard \nMicrosft XSLT and imperative thinking, and you thought that was a good \ntutorial? I can see why you had problems.\n\n&gt; And run this query: http://www.google.com/search?q=xslt+schinkel  You&#39;ll\n&gt; find more than enough g*d d*mn evidence that YES I have used XSLT.  Thank\n&gt; you very much.\n\nI scanned a few of those. Looks like to me like you had some of the \nclassic problems of an imperative programmer trying to migrate to a \nfunctional language.\n\nI don&#39;t doubt you had problems, but they simply didn&#39;t arise for the \nreasons you think they did.\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
