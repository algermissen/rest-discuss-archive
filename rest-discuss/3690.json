Mark responded to the\nchallenge with a simple sketch of how additional functionality\ncould be added to a purchase order application. I have seen\nsimilar answers in the past. I suspect the critics will remain\nunsatisfied with this response and the permathread will continue\nanother day.\n\nWith a rigorous model, it could be more convincingly shown that a\nREST model is at least as expressive as a SOAP-based model. For\nexample, in the web-calculus spec, I show that the web-calculus\nencompases the functionality of DEM. See:\n\nhttp://www.waterken.com/dev/Web/Calculus/#Document_Exchange_Model_(DEM)\n\nHopefully, people will find such an analytic answer more\nconvincing.\n\nTyler\n\n"}}
