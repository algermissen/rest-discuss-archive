The big boys are waking u=\r\np and \n&gt; discovering REST, and naturally they want to protect all us little=\r\n \n&gt; developers from worrying our pretty little heads about nasty things lik=\r\ne \n&gt; HTTP and XML by creating easy-to-use REST frameworks:\n&gt; \n&gt; JSR-311 Jav=\r\na API for RESTful Web Services\n&gt; http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=3D311\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Remember, these are the same jokers who gave us servlets and the \n&gt; URLCon=\r\nnection class as well as gems like JAX-RPC and JAX-WS. They still \n&gt; seem t=\r\no believe that these are actually good specs, and they are \n&gt; proposing to =\r\ntunnel REST services through JAX-WS (Java API for XML Web \n&gt; Services) endp=\r\noints.\n&gt; \n&gt; They also seem to believe that &quot;building RESTful Web services u=\r\nsing the \n&gt; Java Platform is significantly more complex than building SOAP-=\r\nbased \n&gt; services&quot;. I don&#39;t know that this is false, but  if it&#39;s true it&#39;s=\r\n only \n&gt; because Sun&#39;s HTTP API were designed by architecture astronauts wh=\r\no \n&gt; didn&#39;t actually understand HTTP. This proposal does not seem to be \n&gt; =\r\naddressing the need for a decent HTTP API on either the client or server \n&gt;=\r\n side that actually follows RESTful principles instead of fighting \n&gt; again=\r\nst them.\n&gt; \n&gt; To give you an idea of the background we&#39;re dealing with here=\r\n, one of \n&gt; the two people who wrote the proposal &quot;represents Sun on the W3=\r\nC XML \n&gt; Protocol and W3C WS-Addressing working groups where he is co-edito=\r\nr of \n&gt; the SOAP 1.2 and WS-Addressing 1.0 specifications. Marc was \n&gt; co-s=\r\npecification lead for JAX-WS 2.0 (the Java API for Web Services) \n&gt; develop=\r\ned at the JCP and has also served as Sun&#39;s technical lead and \n&gt; alternate =\r\nboard member at the Web Services Interoperability Organization \n&gt; (WS-I).&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; The other submitter seems to be a primary instigator of the Fast Infos=\r\net \n&gt; effort to hide XML in binary goop.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is like asking Karl Rove=\r\n and Dick Cheney to write the Democratic \n&gt; Party platform.\n&gt; \n&gt; Do we real=\r\nly want to trust these folks to define the official Java spec \n&gt; for REST? =\r\nPlease read the JSR, and send comments to jsr-311-comments@...\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope =\r\nwe can derail this completely, but we probably can&#39;t. If not, are \n&gt; there =\r\nany JSR members here who might join the working group and bring \n&gt; some san=\r\nity and actual REST experience to the development of the \n&gt; eventual specif=\r\nication? If we can&#39;t stop it, maybe we can at least limit \n&gt; the damage.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; =EF=BB=BFElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\n&gt; Java I/O 2nd Editi=\r\non Just Published!\n&gt; http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\n&gt; http://www.=\r\namazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=3D0596527500/ref=3Dnosim/cafeaulaitA/\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
