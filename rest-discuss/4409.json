I think the take-away point is this; it&#39;s useful to\n&gt; &gt; both have an architectural guide and a grasp of the practical issues\n&gt; &gt; involved in following such a guide, when designing Web apps (or anything\n&gt; &gt; else, for that matter).  While most discussions on rest-discuss focus on\n&gt; &gt; the guide, that doesn&#39;t mean that we don&#39;t understand, appreciate, or\n&gt; &gt; even discuss on occasion, the practical side of things.  Your\n&gt; &gt; observation about problems with using PUT was welcome; your suggestion\n&gt; &gt; that we don&#39;t appreciate those problems, not so much. 8-O\n&gt;\n&gt; My bad.
