However, there is a clear\nunderstanding that a GET request from a client can never be\nconstrued as a demand for any of these side effects. The client\nbears no blame for issuing a GET request that caused the server\nto do something untoward; if something undesirable happened, it’s\nthe server’s fault.\n\nIf you are looking at some particular side effect, such as\ndeleting a record or the like, which the client should only\nrequest in full knowledge of the consequences, then you require\nwhatever unsafe method is applicable to that side effect. If a\nbad thing happens, it is then the client’s fault for having asked\nfor it.\n\nIn your case, the resource creation is incidental, not something\nthe client is even really aware of; if there’s a problem because\nof that, the blame lies with the server (developer :-) ).\n\nSo making this a side effect upon GET is perfectly fine.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
