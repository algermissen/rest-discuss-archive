There&#39;s the least\n&gt; variability in what that means, and the greatest\n&gt; wealth of toolkits to choose from that factor out\n&gt; most of the gritty details for you.  By and large\n&gt; REST interfaces don&#39;t tell you how to serialize and\n&gt; deserialize complex structures, so you kind of start\n&gt; from scratch every time. If they use a SOAP\nencoding,\n&gt; you get some of that. But there just is nothing\n&gt; simpler than saying &quot;Here&#39;s the XML-RPC interface,\n&gt; and some sample code in a few of the popular\n&gt; scripting languages.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; i see holes in just about every sentence of this but\n&gt; i wonder is it just me; i have nothing good to say\n&gt; about it so i&#39;ll shut up.\n\nVincent,\n\nI think the above text you quote from Dave&#39;s Scripting\nNews is a classic example of the &quot;Plain Folks&quot;\ntechnique of propaganda [1] used to persuade us to buy\ninto XML-RPC (and hopefully buy his company&#39;s\nsoftware).  I&#39;ve noticed he uses an approach that\nalways smacks of, &quot;...why don&#39;t you honest,\nhard-working folks come down to the bingo hall, press\na simple link and kind of try out some plain old web\nservices.&quot;  I believe it&#39;s nothing more a way to cover\nup the real issues with an RPC approach, and\nspecifically the problems with XML-RPC itself.\n\nPoliticians often use this technique to challenge the\ncultural and economic elite, similar to the way it\nseems that Dave is using it to challenge Microsoft and\nother giants in the software industry.  \n\nPhilip\n\n1. http://www.propagandacritic.com/articles/ct.sa.plain.html\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
