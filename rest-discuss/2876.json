Metadata unable to come after data\n\n&gt; I also like the fact that due to the asynchronicity of the protocol, you\ncan interleave data and metadata.\n&gt; This could be pretty handy if you realized that you needed to issue a\nSet-Cookie header in the middle of a response.\n\nI don&#39;t know the details, but this sounds like it may be easier for the\nserver to send a stream of information, but it seems to cause clients to\nbuffer the data until the end of the response which could be disastrous for\nperceived response time of a UI. It also might hurt the ability to do\nstreaming responses if the metadata affects the processing of the streaming\ndata.\n\n"}}
