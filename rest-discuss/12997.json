This is obviously what the web&#39;s founding fathers had in mind \n&gt; but HTML was so wildly successful that we haven&#39;t needed it (until now). \n&gt; Why on earth would anyone want a wrapper format when it was possible to \n&gt; use native HTTP, especially when you&#39;re dealing with potentially \n&gt; enormous files like virtual hard drives and need the raw performance of \n&gt; a clean connection?\n&gt; \n&gt; Sam\n&gt; \n\nIts not just about raw performance though.  There&#39;s also a barrier to \nentry problem very similar to SOAP and CORBA.  Before I heard about \nAtom, one of the things that attracted me to REST was its low barriers \nto entry to create interoperable services.  There were very few steps \nfor me to be able to communicate and work with Java, PHP, Perl, Pythin, \nand Ruby based applications.  I just needed an HTTP library.  Beyond \nHTTP itself there was nothing extra I need to assembly or put together \nto interact with a service.  I&#39;d just be exchanging the information I \nwas interested in.  Get me?  It was simple.\n\nI already started rethinking pub/sub and p2p by writing a one-to-one \nfacade over JMS a year ago:\n\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com/2008/06/16/resteasy-mom-an-exercise-in-jax-rs-restful-ws-design/\n\nThe solution is totally format agnostic.  I want to go down the road of \nreworking the solution as JMS can be too session oriented.\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
