Think of RESTful\napplications to consist of objects (resources) that all have the same API (PUT,\nDELETE, GET, POST, etc). For a component of the application to invoke a method\non an object, it issues an HTTP request. One of the great things is that you\nruntime environment is ubiquitous (given a network cable), it is running\npersistently (its the Web).\n\n&gt; (question: Does the recipient *have* to be a server?\n\nWell, what is *a server*? If you mean some component that is capable of\nprocessing HTTP requests, then yes. But you can certainly mimick REST\nas a standalone application:\n\n\ninterface Resource {\n\tpublic Message GET;\n\tpublic Message POST(Message);\n\t//...\n}\n\nBut the value of REST certainly lies in the use for networked applications.\n\n&gt; What testbeds do people use for restful systems playing/testing?)\n\nI am heavy on Apache+mod_perl+libwww, but a Java Servlet container is\njust as good. Paul Prescod has done a lot with Python IIRC.\n\n\n&gt; &gt;  DELETE (guess what this does),\n&gt; &gt; and POST (process the submitted data, possibly creating a new resource).\n&gt; (server based, or am I just being old fashioned? I&#39;m using post for\n&gt; uploading 1..n files via an html form.)\n\nWhat do you mean by &#39;server based&#39;?\n\nLoosely speaking, POST means &#39;process this&#39;.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  If\n&gt; &gt; you want to put operation=query you can, but it is redundant with &#39;GET&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hadn&#39;t thought of it, but I did have get in mind. Total string length\n&gt; limitations allowing I guess.\n&gt; \n&gt; Am I right in thinking you have gone beyond client and server,\n&gt; and are simply using software which takes advantage of the\n&gt; http protocol?\n\nClient/Server is not an issue (if I understand your use of the term correctly),\nREST is about objects with a uniform API and self descriptive messages between\nthem.\n\nUsually, in the process of understanding REST, you&#39;ll have an aha-moment and the\nfull beauty will be visible at once...until then, it helps to stick your head in\nthe WiKi, the various REST articles, the mailing list archives, and Roy&#39;s\ndissertation of course. It takes some time, but it is definitely worth it.\n\nJan\n\nJan\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If I&#39;m right, is there any way of avoiding the password within this\n&gt; &gt; string?\n&gt; &gt; Definitely. The HTTP supports an extensible authentication mechanism -\n&gt; &gt; multiple styles of identifying the user are supported. Some are easier to\n&gt; &gt; program than others. For example, some use X.509 certificates which assumes\n&gt; &gt; a bunch of other systems are in place.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m happy to defer reading on that till I&#39;ve got my head round the lower\n&gt; level branches :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks Mike.\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; Regards DaveP.\n&gt; XSLT&Docbook  FAQ\n&gt; http://www.dpawson.co.uk/xsl\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
