That is, say you offer a link to what is structured\n&gt; mostly like a level-3 resource, but it actually contains *all* the\n&gt; level-4 resources, and no specific level-3 (or perhaps all the\n&gt; level-4&#39;s that belong to all the level-3&#39;s that belong to a specified\n&gt; level-2).\n\nIn REST resources don&#39;t contain other resources, they link to them.\n\nNow, that linkage could well reflect the sort of containership you&#39;re \ntalking about in your first description, but it could just as well \nreflect the second description.\n\n\n"}}
