HTTP1/...&quot; and response &quot;HTTP code message&quot; so client can\n&gt; &gt; identify server request just based on first lisne (starts with \n&quot;HTTP&quot;\n&gt; &gt; =&gt; response, otherwise try to interpet as request from server).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; i searched web but could not find anybody doing or even \nconsidering it\n&gt; &gt;  ...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; appreciate comments (and URLs)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; thanks,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; alek\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@y...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
