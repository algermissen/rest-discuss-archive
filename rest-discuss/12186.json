be tasked with rigidly conforming to a p=\r\narticular version(s) of OWL\n&gt; ontologies and not have the ability to adapt =\r\nto evolving meaning?\n&gt; Or are you trying to find a way to eliminate the nee=\r\nd for contract\n&gt; versioning altogether?\n&gt; If it&#39;s the former, there was goo=\r\nd paper a few years back that may provide\n&gt; insights to this challenge:\n&gt; N=\r\named Graphs, Provenance and Trust\n&gt; http://www.www2005.org/cdrom/docs/p613.=\r\npdf\n&gt; Though it doesn&#39;t answer everything. =A0( I agree there&#39;s not enough\n=\r\n&gt; discussion of the implications of Linked Data and provenance or versionin=\r\ng,\n&gt; or also, how to denote the effects and semantics of updating linked da=\r\nta\n&gt; with POST or PUT).\n&gt; But the basic jist is this -- ontologies are simi=\r\nlar to relational database\n&gt; schemas, and they need to be versioned like da=\r\nta models. =A0But the benefit is\n&gt; that they&#39;re &#39;open world&#39; and can thus b=\r\ne extended or made equivalent to\n&gt; concepts in other ontologies. =A0 =A0Whi=\r\nch extensions or equivalences you want\n&gt; to consume comes down to the level=\r\n of trust you place on them -- especially\n&gt; if they&#39;re consumed dynamically=\r\n over hypermedia.\n&gt; The practice of using named graphs gives you a construc=\r\nt of creating\n&gt; multiple worlds of data that may have different interpretat=\r\nions associated\n&gt; with them, and a language like SPARQL gives you the abili=\r\nty to query across\n&gt; these named graphs with a &#39;dynamic closed world assump=\r\ntion&#39;.\n&gt; I suspect that, practically speaking, any agent is going to have t=\r\no bind to\n&gt; _some_ version of the ontology that it understood, perhaps dyna=\r\nmically\n&gt; extending it as it goes along (based on hypermedia sensing truste=\r\nd links),\n&gt; but frankly we&#39;re (as an industry) far away from even level of\n=\r\n&gt; sophistication in our agents =A0:-) =A0 =A0 There are some interesting pa=\r\npers out\n&gt; there on &quot;knowledge programming with sensing&quot; that I think would=\r\n be quiet\n&gt; inspirational to anyone looking at how a next-generation linked=\r\n data agent\n&gt;

The relevance of =\r\nthe REST architectural style to Linked Data and\n&gt; OWL/SKOS/etc has been nag=\r\nging away in the back of my mind for the last\n&gt; few months.\n&gt;\n&gt; The idea of=\r\n defining (and even considering the maintenance overhead of)\n&gt; an OWL snaps=\r\nhot of a knowledge domain and binding to it via restricted\n&gt; vocabulary met=\r\nadata fills me with fear. It seems fraught with all the\n&gt; same contract ver=\r\nsioning issues as WSDL, DCOM, etc. Knowledge and\n&gt; meaning are continually =\r\nevolving products of the dynamic social context\n&gt; within which they exist, =\r\nand that fact surely needs to be addressed in\n&gt; any workable content bindin=\r\ng approach...\n&gt;\n&gt; In REST terms, concepts can obviously be modelled as URI-=\r\naddressable\n&gt; resources and published in different representation formats. =\r\nFor\n&gt; example, the location concept &quot;London, UK&quot; can be modelled as a resou=\r\nrce\n&gt; with the address http://dbpedia. org/resource/ London and then publis=\r\nhed\n&gt; in representation formats including RDF, N3, KML, GeoRSS, etc. Howeve=\r\nr I\n&gt; am unsure how the self-describing message and HATEOS constraints\n&gt; tr=\r\nanslate in this context? The best I can come up with is that the\n&gt; DBpedia,=\r\n Freebase, OpenCyc ontologies should be viewed as the knowledge\n&gt; represent=\r\nation equivalents of standard MIME types (or metamedia types?),\n&gt; and that =\r\nhypermedia should be used for runtime binding to the immediate\n&gt; sibling no=\r\ndes of a concept within those standard ontologies (thereby\n&gt; avoiding the v=\r\nersioned contract binding nightmare). Any approach like\n&gt; that would make m=\r\ne feel a lot more comfortable that just tagging stuff\n&gt; with DBpedia URIs, =\r\nwhich seems to violate a whole raft of basic\n&gt; architectural principles e.g=\r\n. encapsulation and separate of\n&gt; interface/implement ation.\n&gt;\n&gt; To my (cle=\r\narly limited) mind, these seem like really important questions\n&gt; and I don&#39;=\r\nt think they are receiving enough consideration in linked\n&gt; data/semantic w=\r\neb circles at present?\n&gt;\n&gt; regards\n&gt;\n&gt; Julian\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message----=\r\n-\n&gt; From: rest-discuss@ yahoogroups. com [mailto:rest-discuss@ yahoogroups.=\r\n com]\n&gt; On Behalf Of Simon Reinhardt\n&gt; Sent: 03 March 2009 15:58\n&gt; Cc: Rest=\r\n List\n&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] This is REST\n&gt;\n&gt; Solomon Duskis wrote:\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; Craig and Subbu&#39;s use of &quot;rel&quot; seems like a good start and I think\n&gt; tha=\r\nt\n&gt;&gt; building on that idea can lead to a &quot;there can be only one&quot; compliant\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; RESTful application.
