The UUIDs are unique even across &quot;types&quot; of resources. So the\n&gt; patients/ or orders/ &quot;prefixes&quot; aren&#39;t really necessary. Since we have to\n&gt; have some URI to list all resources of a given type to start with, I guess I\n&gt; thought that it would make sense to use those URIs as &quot;containers&quot;. Of\n&gt; course, since all of these URIs are retrieved via links in representations,\n&gt; it doesn&#39;t really matter what they look like as long as they&#39;re unique.\n\nWith environmental acquisition as a feature in your RESTful server, all your\nUUIDs could physically exist in the container http://server/CliniVision but be\nrequested as existing in &#39;patients&#39; or &#39;doctors&#39; sub-containers.  Therefore, the\nserver receiving the HTTP request (e.g., let&#39;s say it&#39;s a POST) would know that\nUUIDs exist in the CliniVision container, but see that the client wishes to\nlocate information in the context of specifically CliniVision patients or\ndoctors.\n\n-Philip\n\n\n"}}
