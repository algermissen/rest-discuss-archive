The result is a generic URL in a browser (which can be shared\n&gt;&gt; with everyone), while the generic shoppping basket representation\n&gt;&gt; still can be cached, and having serepate urls for each actual\n&gt;&gt; &#39;shopping basket instance&#39;.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is the best way of doing it I think. Roy pretty much details\n&gt; it in his paper.\n\nWhere specifically? Maybe it&#39;s time for me the reread the whole  \nthing. It has been some time ago.\nMaybe it&#39;s like a good movie or novel: You notice new things each  \ntime you read it.\n\n&gt; But not all browsers support AJAX specifically. Some support\n&gt; Javascript and most support cookies.\n\nI understand. Clients without javascript support should be served  \npersonalized (thus non-cacheable) representations if you want to  \npreserve the &#39;generic&#39; (non-user, non-contents specific) urls. I  \nthink those should be wholly different resources (different URIs from  \nthe generic, cacheable versions).\n\nThis reminds me of some wish I&#39;ve had a long time:\nA framework which can generate generic representations with  \njavascript as well as 100% session dependent representations (never  \ncacheable) based on reported client capabilities, but all generated  \nfrom the same definitions, so the type of representations served is  \ncompletely abstracted away. Does such a framework exist? Is it even  \npossible? Maybe in a functional programming language?\n\nKind regards,\n\nMeryn\n\n\n\n\n"}}
