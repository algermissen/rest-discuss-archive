How it does so is beyond REST, it has to be  \ndefined in the shared message semantics (MIME type in HTTP land).\n\n&gt; REST doesn&#39;t seem to understand the use of forms on the client side  \n&gt; to do editing at all.\n\nWhat o you mean?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; How do I RESTfully get a form to create a new &quot;entry&quot;?\n&gt;\n\nWrong question :-) I should read: &quot;When I design my system, how do I  \nsupport the use case of &quot;create a new entry&quot; so that the support for  \nit does not violate REST constraints?&quot;\n\nAnswer: define message semantics that let the client find the form  \n*at run time*.\n\nHTH,\n\nJan\n\n&gt; Scott\n&gt;\n&gt; Jan Algermissen wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Scott,\n&gt;&gt; IMO forms should either be discovered while the client proceeds   \n&gt;&gt; through the application&#39;s state machine or the MIME type that   \n&gt;&gt; supports the desired interactions should provide sufficient  \n&gt;&gt; semantics  so the client knows when to expect the forms (e.g. Atom  \n&gt;&gt; Publishing  Protocol&#39;s &lt;accept&gt; element)\n&gt;&gt; Keep in mind that a form is essentially information provided by  \n&gt;&gt; the  server to the client about the availability of a certain   \n&gt;&gt; (parameterized) state transition within a given application.\n&gt;&gt; The MIME type should provide enough semantics to tell client   \n&gt;&gt; implementors how to handle a form (and maybe when to expect one)  \n&gt;&gt; and  the server should then just provide the forms as needed to  \n&gt;&gt; enable the  application.\n&gt;&gt; HTH,\n&gt;&gt; Jan\n&gt;&gt; On Aug 5, 2006, at 6:58 PM, Scott Chapman wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; If hitting a URL with GET is supposed to give you a view of the   \n&gt;&gt;&gt; resource and\n&gt;&gt;&gt; it&#39;s not a form by default, then how to do you get a &lt;form...&gt;  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; view  of it for\n&gt;&gt;&gt; editing?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; The same applies to getting a blank form for creating a new  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; resource.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; How are people handling these situations in their RESTful designs?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n\n"}}
