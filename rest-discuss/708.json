Nevertheless, I can see no harm in allowing a\n&gt; client to submit several requests that they would like to be executed\n&gt; atomically when and if the commit message does come through. If the\n&gt; message doesn&#39;t, then you just throw away the requests after a timeout.\n\n2PC is one form of implementing transactions between disparate parties,\nbut it&#39;s not the only way.  So assuming you just want some notion of a\n&quot;transaction&quot;, there&#39;s a number of options.  It also depends how much\nof &quot;ACID&quot; you need.  I recall that even in SQL92, they broke down some\nof the transaction opacity that was prevalent in 89.\n\nAs I mentioned offline, I had at one time considered a CHECKPOINT/\nRESTORE method pair, where you&#39;d get an etag like thing that\nrepresented the resource&#39;s state at some point in time.  RESTORE with\nthis tag would return to the resource to that state with the intention\nof rolling back everything since the time it was created ... unless it\ndidn&#39;t want to.\n\nI think there&#39;s lots of interesting work to be done there.  I haven&#39;t\nhad much interest in transactional systems for some time, but I know\nlots of people do. 8-)\n\nI figure that any general solution to this problem will have to look a\nlot like a compensating transaction, where you make your best effort to\nfix stuff up, but if that doesn&#39;t work, you manage it as part of your\napp, in the same way you manage 5xx errors with HTTP.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
