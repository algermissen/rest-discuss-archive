Generic may not be a client per se,=\r\n but a framework that allows to create a client by some sort of configurati=\r\non (description language? may not be adopted since it recalls WSDL which is=\r\n hated nowadays and misunderstood) or training where it learns the semantic=\r\ns.\n2. A standardized (or at least agreed upon) set of ways to define links =\r\nto represent those semantics. (WSDL like again?)\n3. The actual particular c=\r\node, AKA the plugin part you will create.\n\nJust a word about WSDL. The bigg=\r\nest mistake was the code generation. If WSDL was to be interpreted on the f=\r\nly, and the interactions dynamically followed, I guess people would not non=\r\n-sensically hate it as they do now.\nSo, that framework IS NOT A CODE GENERA=\r\nTION thing. It should read and process the config on the fly, and the confi=\r\ng is to be provided by the first URL you hit in the system.
