The dissertati=\r\non says &quot;standard methods and\n&gt; representations&quot; but I understand this[1] a=\r\ns Roy clarifying that he\n&gt; meant specified not necessarily standardized.\n&gt;\n=\r\n\nThe wording of my answer was off, as well.  Being self-descriptive,\ni.e. r=\r\negistered, is the minimum requirement for an identifier.  REST&#39;s\nuniform in=\r\nterface benefits are tied to uptake, i.e. standardization, of\nthe identifie=\r\nd media type.  Standardization doesn&#39;t imply &quot;standard&quot; to\nme, it implies t=\r\nhat an open process is being followed, or is intended\nto be followed.\n\nWhat=\r\n I get from Roy&#39;s statement, is that the preferred process for\ndeveloping a=\r\n new media type is to register an identifier and start\nusing it, then if it=\r\n becomes popular enough to justify the effort, get\nit accepted as a standar=\r\nd by some standards body or another.  If a new\nmedia type doesn&#39;t generate =\r\nenough interest to become a standard, the\nbenefits of a uniform interface w=\r\non&#39;t be realized by systems which\ndepend on it.\n\n&quot;We could try to standardi=\r\nze something like what I describe above,\nbut it would require multiple inde=\r\npendent implementations and a\nlot more free time than it probably deserves.=\r\n&quot;\n\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/15819\n\nThe probl=\r\nem with using &#39;MIC&#39; as a request header, is that it isn&#39;t in\nthe IANA regis=\r\ntry that&#39;s been defined for those, so it isn&#39;t self-\ndescriptive.  The ques=\r\ntion then becomes, where Web architecture is\nconcerned, how to get such a h=\r\neader registered -- does IANA require an\napproved standards body to sign of=\r\nf on &#39;MIC&#39;?  If so, then yeah, those\nstandards bodies require multiple inde=\r\npendent implementations first...\n\nOn the Web, there is a defined set of rul=\r\nes for registering new media\ntype identifiers, headers, link relations and =\r\nrequest methods as part\nof the network-based uniform interface.  The fact t=\r\nhat identifiers only\nneed to be registered to be self-descriptive doesn&#39;t m=\r\nean that\nnonstandard methods, link relations or headers are allowed to be\nr=\r\negistered, so it doesn&#39;t mean that standardization isn&#39;t important to\nthe o=\r\nverall definition of self-descriptive messaging.\n\nWhere media type identifi=\r\ners are concerned, on the Web, self-descriptive\nmeans IANA-registered.  I d=\r\non&#39;t care if you&#39;re using an unregistered\nidentifier that&#39;s pending registr=\r\nation, provided you&#39;re aware of the\nconsequences of that registration being=\r\n rejected, and provided you&#39;re\naware that such registration is a requiremen=\r\nt of self-descriptiveness.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; It seems far-reaching to me that an archite=\r\nctural style could go so\n&gt; far as to constrain the governance model of form=\r\nats.  The goal is\n&gt; shared understanding, which can be effectively achieved=\r\n regardless of\n&gt; how the format was crafted (this is the same as the ubiqui=\r\ntous types\n&gt; line of reasoning too:).\n&gt; \n\nThe benefit of any uniform interf=\r\nace network-based API comes from the\nshared understanding being documented =\r\nfor all to see, instead of hidden\ninside a code library.  In meta-style ter=\r\nms, there&#39;s no requirement for\na registry.  REST requires a registry, not a=\r\n governance model.  The Web\narchitecture is what constrains the governance =\r\nmodel to IANA.  Self-\ndescriptive identifiers have nothing to do with a reg=\r\nistry or IANA or\nMIME in Gopher, which is why I keep bringing up Gopher -- =\r\nit isn&#39;t REST\nbut it is a uniform interface network-based API if and only i=\r\nf the\nshared understanding of identifiers is contained within the spec,\nins=\r\ntead of code libraries.\n\n&quot;That doesn&#39;t sound like a problem encountered by =\r\nRESTful\narchitectures. Reliable upload of multiple files can be\nperformed u=\r\nsing a single zip file, but the assumption being made\nhere is that the clie=\r\nnt has a shared understanding of what the\nserver is intending to do with th=\r\nose files. That&#39;s coupling.&quot;\n\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discu=\r\nss/message/15797\n\nThe problem with two organizations sharing an understandi=\r\nng that&#39;s\nembedded in code libraries, is that it leads to IDLs and contract=\r\ns\nspecifying fixed behavior.  This couples systems together, instead of\nunc=\r\noupling them based on external specifications.  Any architectural\nstyle tha=\r\nt&#39;s fundamentally a distributed hypermedia application\nprotocol, minimally =\r\nrequires the shared understanding of the identifier\nto be public, in order =\r\nthat the interface may be considered uniform.\n\nIf you define-down &quot;particip=\r\nant&quot; to mean only partner corporations, it\nstill isn&#39;t an argument for usin=\r\ng a library-based API, because those\nparticipants will run into the same ev=\r\nolvability problems encountered\nin the early Web architecture when systems =\r\nwere coupled together by\nlibwww -- requiring IDLs and interface-level contr=\r\nacts (as opposed to\ncontracts between stakeholders, agreeing to use the sam=\r\ne standards).\nThe library-based API approach didn&#39;t work at the small scale=\r\n of the\nWeb in the early 90&#39;s between CERN and NCSA, so how can it be expec=\r\nted\nto work on today&#39;s Web between larger entities?\n\nThe REST style require=\r\ns registration, and the Web architecture has\nevolved to include registries =\r\nwhich specifically define what is self-\ndescriptive and what isn&#39;t, includi=\r\nng a proposal for a registry for\nauthentication schemes (initially containi=\r\nng basic and digest).  REST\nrequires such registries, Web architecture defi=\r\nnes IANA registries to\nmeet that requirement.  At least, that&#39;s how the Web=\r\n has evolved in\npractice, for reasons I assume to be directly related to RE=\r\nST.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The original question is odd though.  &quot;Media Type&#39;s&quot; aren&#39;t\n&gt; self=\r\n-descriptive - messages are, and media types are one component of\n&gt; self-de=\r\nscriptiveness:\n&gt; \n&gt; o) &quot;interaction is stateless between requests&quot;\n&gt; o) &quot;st=\r\nandard methods and media types are used to indicate semantics\n&gt; and exchang=\r\ne information&quot;\n&gt; o) &quot;responses explicitly indicate cacheability&quot;\n&gt; o) &quot;the =\r\ntype is registered and the registry points to a specification\n&gt; and the spe=\r\ncification explains how to process the data according to\n&gt; its intent&quot; **\n&gt;=\r\n \n\nThat&#39;s right, self-descriptiveness isn&#39;t entirely about the identifier,\n=\r\nbut a registered identifier is the minimal requirement.  Beyond that,\nnowhe=\r\nre does Roy state that methods, media types and link relations\nonly need re=\r\ngistration but not standardization.  Where Web architecture\nis concerned, w=\r\ne&#39;d need to look up the requirements for each of those\nIANA registries, to =\r\ndetermine if it&#39;s even possible to register\nanything that isn&#39;t already sta=\r\nndardized, and determine sanctioned\nstandards bodies.\n\nIt isn&#39;t forbidden t=\r\no evolve new things which may be defined in the\nIANA registries, it&#39;s just =\r\nthat systems which rely on them won&#39;t accrue\nthe benefits of REST until the=\r\ny&#39;re standardized.  IOW, if you *do*\ncreate a new thing which is of general=\r\n interest, then you MUST\nstandardize it such that not only you, but anyone =\r\nelse, can use it as\npart of a network-based API.  Such standardization is n=\r\not an a-priori\nrequirement, to allow for evolution, but it is ultimately un=\r\navoidable\nwhen instantiating REST systems for the common case of the Web.\n\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; To answer the original question, the vnd/prs trees can lead to shared\n&gt;=\r\n understanding and satisfy that part of self-descriptiveness.\n&gt; \n\nClose -- =\r\nregistration in any tree leads to a network-based shared\nunderstanding of t=\r\nhe identifier, required for self-descriptiveness.\n\nIs the shared understand=\r\ning between participants embedded within code\nlibraries?  Then they&#39;re coup=\r\nled.  If those participants are coded\nagainst an external specification of =\r\nshared understanding, they&#39;re\ndecoupled.  Systems reliant upon identifiers =\r\nand media types (or headers\nor auth schemes or link relations or methods) t=\r\nhat aren&#39;t intended to\never be published as standards, will never accrue th=\r\ne benefits of REST,\nbecause they&#39;ll always be library-based APIs by virtue =\r\nof failing the\nself-descriptiveness constraint.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
