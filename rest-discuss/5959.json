Session state is\n&gt;&gt; therefore kept entirely on the client.&quot;\n\n&gt; He says &quot;each request from client to server must must contain all of the \n&gt; information necessary to understand the request.&quot;  He doesn&#39;t say that \n&gt; information must be in the URI.  It could be in a header, e.g. an \n&gt; Accept-* header, or a Cookie header, or even in the body of the request, \n&gt; right?\n\nYes.\n\n&gt;&gt;    That is, it should always be possible for  \n&gt;&gt; the client to explicitly Represent what State a Request is relying upon.\n&gt;&gt;   \n&gt; I&#39;m not sure what that means.  Any representation could represent any \n&gt; state.  So the number &quot;1&quot; could represent... anything.\n\nNo. A classic example is the simple demo of the benefits of a page\ntemplating engine; for example jsp (this is a *real* example\nremembered from the jsp spec, which I was involved with at one point):\n\n  &lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n  &lt;% \n  int counter = ((Integer)session.getAttribute(&quot;counter&quot;)).intValue();\n  counter++;\n  session.setAttribute(&quot;counter&quot;, new Integer(counter));\n  %&gt;\n  This page has been accessed: &lt;%= counter %&gt; times.\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n  &lt;/html&gt;\n\nEvery time that resource is accessed it will be different. And the\ninformation which allows you to see how it is different is not\navailable in the request, it&#39;s stored in the &quot;session&quot;.\n\n\n\nThe above example is also a good illustration of why sessions are\nbad. It is clearly unscalable to do the above. You can start fixing\nthat scalability problem by throwing money at bea or whoever... but\nthat way is very expensive. \n\nBy designing RESTfully you get to write less cheques.\n\n\nNic Ferrier\n\n\nPS note that keeping data in the cookie header is ok. As long as it&#39;s\nalways presented in the cookie header. You have to be able to do\nshopping carts somehow.\n\n"}}
