That doesn&#39;t \nmean\n&gt; they don&#39;t have their uses, of course.  But there other ways of \ndoing\n&gt; &quot;sessions&quot; statelessly, and doing them statefully is not REST.\n\nAt least three frequently asked questions are contained in that \nparagraph:\n1. Cookies vs REST?\n2. Sessions vs REST?\n3. What does REST mean by &quot;stateless&quot;?\n\n#1 & #2 of course are closely related.\n#3 has a larger range.  \n\nI added those questions to the rest-wiki FAQ page.  Without answers, \nsince I don&#39;t really feel qualified to sort out the various confused \nanswers I&#39;ve seen on this list and elsewhere.\n\nGood answers would be a blessing.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
