In fact,\n&gt; &gt; theres&#39; no reason why you can&#39;t actually implement code that does\n&gt; &gt; an actual PUT or DELETE or whatever to the &quot;real&quot; resource when a\n&gt; &gt; POST is made to one of the &quot;fake&quot; resources.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Why not just do a PUT on the real resource whenever you receive a\n&gt;  POST on the real resource? Having the fake resource in the middle\n&gt;  seems superfuous to me. All you need is an if-then on the server,\n&gt;  before you dispatch on the HTTP method field.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Also, consider that POST encompasses &#39;processThis&#39; semantics, which\n&gt;  are more general-purpose than GET/PUT/DELETE. I think that makes for\n&gt;  a more natural fit.\n\nI guess you&#39;re right. I think I was just trying to justify creating the \nextra resources by giving them more to do. One if-then on the server \nwouldn&#39;t be bad (and in the web framework I&#39;m using, I wouldn&#39;t even \nneed that).\n\nI was just worried about the &quot;conceptual&quot; overhead of each resource. If \na resource only returned (for GET) and only accepted (for PUT/POST) one \ncontent type, that seems like it would be easier to reason about.\n\nYou said in another message that you expose your resources like this:\n\n&gt; /foo/html\n&gt; /foo/html_form\n&gt; /foo/pdf\n&gt; /foo/xml\n\nSo you *never* do a GET on /foo? You only PUT, POST, DELETE to it?\n\n-- Jason\n\n"}}
