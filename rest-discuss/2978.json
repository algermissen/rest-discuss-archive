The first user POSTed representations\n&gt; &gt; of c and d to /a/b.  Yet in the second case b was\n&gt; &gt; PUT to /a/b with c and d already POSTed to it.\n&gt; &gt; In both cases new resources will exist at\n&gt; &gt; /a/b, /a/b/c and /a/b/d.\n&gt;\n&gt; There&#39;s something a little strange going on here. \n&gt; How can the &#39;b&#39; of the PUT (a representation) have \n&gt; had things POSTed to it?  POST is defined as a \n&gt; resource method, not a way to compose\n&gt; representations.  Do I miss the boat?\n\nThanks for the question.  For the second example\nyou&#39;re asking about, I assumed the requestor created a\nresource with subordinates c and d, then a\nrepresentation of the whole thing was transferred to\n/a/b via PUT.  But there&#39;s nothing stopping you from\nonly constructing representations of b containing\nrepresentations of c and d on the fly and transferring\nthat instead.\n\nThe difference between the two approaches is that you\ncan either transfer representations taken from\nexisting resources, or construct and transfer your own\nrepresentations (e.g., telnet to the node and\nliterally type out the PUT request and its XML)\nwithout relying on an existing (non-vacuous) resource.\n\nI&#39;ve coded my toolkit project under this philosophy. \nPlease let me know if there is a flaw in my thinking.\n\nThanks,\nPhilip\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
