In the examples\n&gt; &gt; &gt;people have given, the client expects that a particular POST invocation\n&gt; &gt; &gt;will result in a resource being created (and furthermore, that this\n&gt; &gt; &gt;resource will have a particular relationship to the POSTed\n&gt; &gt; &gt;representation).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nonsense, Mark.  Of course that is REST -- it is right in the\n&gt; &gt; HTTP standard.  The client is *told* by the server the URI of\n&gt; &gt; the new resource.  The client doesn&#39;t need any other expectation than\n&gt; &gt; simply following HTTP.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve read the whole discussion, Roy, because that&#39;s\n&gt; part of my point.\n&gt; \n&gt; Would it have helped if I clarified that from the server&#39;s POV, it&#39;s\n&gt; RESTful since uniform semantics are *provided*, but from the client&#39;s\n&gt; it isn&#39;t since uniform semantics aren&#39;t *expected*?  Or are you saying\n&gt; that REST doesn&#39;t constrain the client end of connectors?  That wouldn&#39;t\n&gt; make much sense to me.\n\nMark,\n\nat first glance I&#39;d say that Roy is obviously right, but then I do not expect\nthat you are simply, obvously wrong. Maybe you are talking past each other?\n\nWhy not turn this issue around: What are the expectations a client may make\nabout a resource that implements POST?\n\nAnd: aren&#39;t your RDFForms essentially a means to augment the allowed expectations\n(e.g. to keep you from POSTing a shoe order to a registration service)?\n\nBut I guess I am missing some piece in your thinking...?\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n-- \nJan Algermissen\nConsultant & Programmer\t\nhttp://www.jalgermissen.com\n\n"}}
