The result of that conversation seemed to be that the problem is the usage of the term &#39;REST&#39; in that nothing about RPC over HTTP is RESTful in nature.\n\nI think one of the big problems in this area is the lack of proper names for all the various abuses of REST. Having names helps to differentiate. I created a classification of mis-uses a while back: http://nordsc.com/ext/classification_of_http_based_apis.html\n\n&gt; My argument, the fact that folks want to use HTTP as a pure transport for loose XML/JSON in itself is not a problem asd long as one has proper expectations about the pros/cons.\n\nYes, but the problem being the end of the sentence: &quot;as long as one has proper expectations&quot;. I seriously doubt that a significant number of people understand the trade offs (if they did, they would just do true REST because the gains outweigh (IMHO small) the additional effort).\n\nWhile there might not be a problem if you understand what you are doing, it also makes no real sense to do it (it is not really justifiable).\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; That led me to think of a new term to represent the &quot;RPC over HTTP&quot; movement and which is along the spirit of the whole &quot;No SQL&quot; mantra.  &quot;No SOAP&quot; - the meaning of which is &quot;Not Only SOAP&quot;.\n&gt;  \n&gt; LIke it or hate it?\n\n\n\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Glenn\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n-----------------------------------\n Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n NORD Software Consulting\n\n Mail: algermissen@...\n Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n Work: http://www.nordsc.com/\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
