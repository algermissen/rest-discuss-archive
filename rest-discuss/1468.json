Is the Web \n&gt; today mostly no=\r\nn-RESTful?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I was talking with a colleague this morning and evangeli=\r\nzing \n&gt; REST to him.  I was telling him that one of the disavantages \n&gt; of =\r\nSOAP is that the identity of a target resource is hidden \n&gt; within the SOAP=\r\n body, as opposed to being clearly shown in \n&gt; the URL [although this is no=\r\nt a requirement of SOAP it is \n&gt; common practice of vendors].  \n&gt; \n&gt; My col=\r\nleague responded saying that many (if not most) Web \n&gt; applications today u=\r\nse this paradigm of funneling all \n&gt; requests though a single URL. \n\nNo, fu=\r\nnnelling through a single process maybe. \n\n&gt; For example, with CGI applicat=\r\nions there is only one URL.  \n&gt; The CGI code delegates the request to the a=\r\nppropriate \n&gt; application.  \n\nThat&#39;s not strictly true.\n\n\n&gt; Likewise, Cold =\r\nFusion applications all funnel \n&gt; to the same URL.  He said, &quot;go to amazon,=\r\n you will see that \n&gt; all URLs funnel through obidos&quot; (I checked, he&#39;s corr=\r\nect). \n\nBut that&#39;s different from using 1 URL to display many resources.\nSo=\r\nme sites do that, it&#39;s a pain (they&#39;re often the ones you can&#39;t\nbookmark). =\r\nYour colleague forget to mention all the stuff appended\nafter obidos.\n\n \n&gt; =\r\nHe stipulated that the majority of the Web is non-RESTful.  \n&gt; He also argu=\r\ned that if the REST model does not support this \n&gt; single-URL paradigm then=\r\n it is not in tune with the &quot;real \n&gt; Web&quot; and therefore REST is merely a fi=\r\ngment of Roy Fielding&#39;s \n&gt; imagination.\n&gt; \n&gt; Three (very naive) questions:\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Are his statements about CGI and Cold Fusion correct?\n\nPartially. Y=\r\nou can do CGI that way, but:\n\n http: //example.org/cgi-bin/cgi.cgi?resource=\r\n1\n http: //example.org/cgi-bin/cgi.cgi?resource2\n\ngo through the same CGI b=\r\nut use 2 URLs. As I understand it, there&#39;s\nnothing wrong with doing this, s=\r\no long as each resources is\naddressable. What your colleague describes is s=\r\nometimes called a\nfront controller in J2EE land. The ultimate front control=\r\nler is the\nweb server dispatching on http: //example.org. By that line of\na=\r\nrgument, web servers are not restful. So it&#39;s not the funnelling\nbut the ad=\r\ndressing thast counts. \n\nBut if I can get back representations for resource=\r\ns 1 and 2 via a\nsingle URL:\n\n http: //example.org/cgi-bin/cgi.cgi\n\nmy under=\r\nstanding is that&#39;s not restful.\n\n \n&gt; 2. Is it true that the majority of the=\r\n Web is non-RESTful?\n\nCouldn&#39;t say and it depends on whether you&#39;re countin=\r\ng URLs or\nknown resources. I doubt if there are more URLs that can return &gt;=\r\n1\nresource representations that there those that return 1. Though\nit&#39;s quit=\r\ne possible that most resources are sharing URLs.\n\n \n&gt; 3. Should we (the RES=\r\nT evangelists) be arguing against CGI, \n&gt; Cold Fusion, as well as SOAP?\n\nI =\r\nthink only if they are used to hide &gt;1 resources behind a single\nURL.\n\nBill=\r\n de h=D3ra\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: PGP 7.0.4\n\niQA/AwUBPQdtH=\r\n+aWiFwg2CH4EQJIugCg0aLlQJIzHHH9w3d70z4dKdX+dSkAn1JA\nMjAu1WM0K/PxxDK6YcY2JK7=\r\n2\n=3D+i+l\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n\n"}}
