Yep. That&#39;s how it works.\n\nLet&#39;s review this again.  Sure, the Web forces you to give everything a URI.  HTTPspace\nis a subspace of URIspace.  However, the Web *specifically* and *by design* does not\nforce a hypertext interface for everything.  The HTTP and URI specs have very little to\nsay about hypertext specifically.  HTMLspace / XMLspace are subspaces of HTTPspace.\nAnything in HTTPspace, or indeed in URIspace, can be addressed from *MLspace, but the\nextent of the larger spaces is not constrained by what is reified in the smaller\nspaces.\n\nI think it&#39;s a bad idea to assume equivalence.\n\n&gt; Anything can be given a URI without\n&gt; great expense and anything can be addressed through hypertext without\n&gt; great expense. REST is about simplifying component interfaces through\n&gt; constraints. These are two simplifying constraints.\n\nIMO, it&#39;s not a &quot;simplifying&quot; or empowering constraint to assume that, in order to use\nsomething, I have to reify a reference to it in hypertext.\n\n&gt; That&#39;s the last I&#39;ll say on rest-discuss on the issue.\n\nDitto.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
