What do you mean by complete?  What do you mean\n&gt; by &quot;hyperlink model&quot;?  \n\nIf an information provider wants to provide access to information\nobjects, no matter how many or how opaque, and they have control over a\nweb server then they can provide this access using hypertext documents.\nWe have twelve years of experience to back that up. I can point to\ndozens of applications where opaque, regularly named information objects\nwere served through the web without client-side URI munging. If an\ninformation provider chooses not to use the standard web mechanisms to\nreference their data objects then they are simply being irresponsible\nand shifting the burden onto their information consumers. \n\nAs an information consumer, of course I may choose to &quot;hack&quot; based on\nthings I notice about their namespaces. I might also choose to take\nadvantage of things I know about their HTTP Server implementation or\ncache too. But that doesn&#39;t mean that it is *good practice* to make\nclient-side assumptions about either namespace structure or web server\nimplementation.\n\n&gt; ... And how do you respond to the many, many examples that\n&gt; have been offered where objects nameable by URI are added to the Webspace but are\n&gt; not added to a hyperstructure.\n\nIf somebody chooses not to give something a hypertext interface on the\nWeb then I don&#39;t really see why I have any responsibility to help them.\nThey could similarly complain that the Web forces you to give everything\na URI. Yep. That&#39;s how it works. Anything can be given a URI without\ngreat expense and anything can be addressed through hypertext without\ngreat expense. REST is about simplifying component interfaces through\nconstraints. These are two simplifying constraints. I would be similarly\nfrustrated if someone started a big discussion about &quot;should web\naddressing really be limited to URIs?&quot;\n\nThat&#39;s the last I&#39;ll say on rest-discuss on the issue.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
