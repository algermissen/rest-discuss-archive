If I want to change\n&gt; &lt;dt&gt;State Song&lt;/dt&gt; to &lt;dt&gt;Song&lt;/dt&gt; why do I care if someone has, in \n&gt; the meantime, appended &lt;dd&gt;Rocky Mountain High&lt;/dd&gt; under &lt;dt&gt;State \n&gt; Song&lt;/dt&gt; thereby changing the source?  It doesn&#39;t change the ETag for \n&gt; the partial resource I&#39;m interested in updating so it doesn&#39;t affect \n&gt; a conditional PUT request.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;This is one of the attractive propositions of PATCH:  Presumably the \n&gt;&gt;etag you use is the one for the entire resource, even though you&#39;re only \n&gt;&gt;updating a subset.  This is useful.  It&#39;s also one of the requirements \n&gt;&gt;for Web3S apparently (they allow ETags to apply to URL hierarchies to \n&gt;&gt;solve the issue).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; But the overriding purpose of PATCH is to save bytes over using PUT.  If \n&gt; we can conceive a way to update XML trees without the PATCH message body \n&gt; taking more bytes than using an XPointer query as I&#39;ve described then \n&gt; there is no reason to implement PATCH for XML updates.\n\nFor what is a man profited, if he shall gain all the bytes in the world, \nand lose his consistency?\n\n\n"}}
