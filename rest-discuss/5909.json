For instance:\n&gt; \n&gt; - Granularity: will every property be it&#39;s own resource?\n\nDefine &quot;property&quot; and perhaps I can answer that. Some properties like \ncontent-length are implicit in the data and may not have independent \nrepresentations. Others like author may be embedded inside the data in \nsomething like an &lt;author&gt; tag. others may be independent resources. As \nI see it there&#39;s no single list of properties, for a resource, and no \ncentral repository of those properties. Different people may want to use \ndifferent properties for the same resources. These people are not \nnecessarily the owners of the resources.\n\nIt sounds like your mental model treats the Web as just a strange sort \nof interface to a filesystem. Certainly WebDAV thinks of it that way. A \nfile system has a very clear distinction between data and metadata. A \nfile system very well may have a central metadata repository of some \nkind, a single place where a fixed set of attributes is stored for all \nfiles. But the Web is not a file system! It is much more generic and \nflexible than that.\n\n\n&gt; If it is, how do I change a set of properties in a single operation?\n\nI don&#39;t think there&#39;s a finite set of properties that you can change in \na single operation. You can change the implicit properties such as \ncontent length and word count via a PUT. You can change some set of RDF \nproperties by PUTing an RDF document to another URL. You may be able to \nchange other properties through the right POST request. It depends on \nwhich properties which servers expose and how they expose them. There&#39;s \nno single answer to this question, nor does there need to be.\n\n&gt; - Discovery: given the URL of a resource, how do I discover other \n&gt; resources that provide data/metadata about this resource?\n&gt; \n\nThere are numerous ways this can be implemented if it&#39;s important. I \nsuspect almost all of them involve getting documents, probably RDF or \nXML documents, from known or deduced URLs. e.g. \nhttp://www.metadatarepository.org/?query=www.example.com/foo.html. I \ndon&#39;t think any Web-wide standard is necessary or useful here.\n\n&gt; - Performance: what exactly do I need to do to find out name, content \n&gt; type, length and author of all members of a collection? In WebDAV, \n&gt; that&#39;s one single request.\n\nPut an XML document at a URL that contains that information. Then GET \nit. No big deal. Not that you&#39;re likely to need all that at once anyway. \n  For instance, why would you actually want to know the length of every \nresource in a collection?  The only reason I can think of is because \nyou&#39;re duplicating the &quot;ls -l&quot; functionality of a filesystem. But \nactually the length isn&#39;t usually especially relevant. Would you not \nopen a file you want if it&#39;s two megabytes long instead of one? We&#39;ve \nlearned to expect it because file systems provide it, but it&#39;s hardly \nthe most important metadata. In fact, it&#39;s probably one of the least \nimportant.\n\nFree yourself from file system thinking, and see where it takes you. I \nsuspect you&#39;ll be astonished at how liberating that is. There&#39;s no \nreason in 2006 for users to be limited by the logical structures used to \nstore bits on spinning metal discs.\n\n-- \nï»¿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n"}}
