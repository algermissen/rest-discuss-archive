today, you might add PNG and Atom to this list, and maybe \nfeed paging.\n\nour goal is to have a simple way of bundling these concepts (link \nrelation types and media types) and communicating them to clients as a \nguide to what might happen when they follow their nose in the hypermedia \nspace exposed by our services. &quot;this is what you definitely should \naccept, and of course, you should always expect unknown things to show \nup as well&quot;, this is what we as service providers would like to be able \nto say, and in addition to that, they might even want to provide an \nactual map (a subset) of the resources they are serving, which would be \nthe sitemap model. such a servicemap would pretty much point your nose \nat very many resources immediately, and you could either just be happy \nwith those resources, or you might follow links from them to more \nresources. i think it is important to keep in mind that a sitemap, \nlooked at as a resource, is a very RESTful thing in itself, it contains \na (large) set of links, and clients can find such a map and use such a \nmap purely by &quot;follow your nose&quot; principles.\n\ncheers,\n\ndret.\n\n-- \nerik wilde | mailto:dret@...  -  tel:+1-510-2061079 |\n            | UC Berkeley  -  School of Information (ISchool) |\n            | http://dret.net/netdret http://twitter.com/dret |\n\n"}}
