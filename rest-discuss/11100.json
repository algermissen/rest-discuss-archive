(reverse it?). I\nthink that would be a great feature..\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ll throw a final option in just for the fun of it. Consider that\n&gt; http://example.com/projectname can be represented as\n&gt; http://tinyurl.com/5mdzjd (I created this myself) you could &#39;hash&#39; it\n&gt; using the tinyurl path (or write your own tiny-clone), e.g.\n&gt;\n&gt; .../projects/5mdzjd\n\nThat&#39;s a short and nice URL, but then I&#39;m making my service dependent\non tinyurl.com right? Which I think is best to avoid in the long run.\nI could create my own &quot;clone&quot; as you suggest, but I think that might\nbee a bit complex solution.\n\nI think maybe I&#39;ll try encoding the URL, and perhaps support some hash\nformat of the URL too. (Hopefully, they won&#39;t overlap).\n\nThanks,\n- Erling\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Alan Dean\n&gt;\n&gt; On Sat, Aug 2, 2008 at 11:59 AM, Erling Wegger Linde &lt;erlingwl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Hi,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m creating a RESTful web service (actually AtomPub).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ../projects/ returns an Atom feed\n&gt;&gt; ../projects/{project} returns an Atom entry with a DOAP description of\n&gt;&gt; a project in the &lt;content&gt; element\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; DOAP is an ontology for describing projects (see\n&gt;&gt; https://trac.usefulinc.com/doap)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; My original plan was to use the projects name (e.g. doap:name) as the\n&gt;&gt; key for the project, i.e.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ../projects/{name}\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But in DOAP a project is uniquely defined from its homepage\n&gt;&gt; (doap:homepage) which of course is much better than to use the\n&gt;&gt; doap:name.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So I&#39;m thinking of using a hash of the doap:homepage such as\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ../projects/{hash of doap:homepage}\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Has anyone done something similar before? I&#39;m thinking that my case is\n&gt;&gt; not very unique and that this is a general topic for REST. (i.e. how\n&gt;&gt; to embed URLs in URLs - if one can say that).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So as I&#39;m searching for a hash algorithm that I could use (a client\n&gt;&gt; should be able to reverse the hash to get the URL an vice versa), I&#39;m\n&gt;&gt; thinking that if there was a best practice for doing this in REST,\n&gt;&gt; that would be a good thing. E.g. clients could exploit this\n&gt;&gt; information somehow. Does there exist such a &quot;best practice&quot;, or\n&gt;&gt; should there be one?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; And finally; any hash-algorithms that you recommend?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;&gt; - Erling\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \nMed vennlig hilsen\nErling Wegger Linde\n\n"}}
