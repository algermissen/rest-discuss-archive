There’s a lot of talk in object-oriented language\n&gt; research about the importance of minimizing coupling and it’s\n&gt; interesting for me sometimes because generally what some people\n&gt; do in the language research in terms of coupling is so much\n&gt; more extensive than the level of requirements that we had for\n&gt; minimizing coupling. We needed a system that could be developed\n&gt; independently by 500-1000 different companies, and each of the\n&gt; things that they added to the web could be extended and\n&gt; deployed independently without affecting anyone else on the\n&gt; web, again without actually knowing what those extensions will\n&gt; be. And the only way you can do that is completely eliminate\n&gt; coupling between clients and servers. The only coupling that\n&gt; exists in a REST-based architecture is that the first address\n&gt; that you access has… ah… basically a bookmark, and you need to\n&gt; keep track of that bookmark. So essentially the rationale\n&gt; behind the “Cool URIs Don’t Change” is essentially that’s the\n&gt; last remaining bit of coupling in the architectures that are\n&gt; based on REST.\n\nSo yeah. Decoupling via hypermedia-driven app state does not\nextend backward past the beginning of a client-server interaction\nin a way that rather reminds me of how causality within this\nuniverse does not extend backward past the big bang pinhole.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
