In any callback message, #1 and #2 can&#39;t\nbe assumed.  Responses happen in the context of specific prior requests and\nspecific prior connections.  Designers of a callback scheme have a burden of\nproof to show that messages can be strongly correlated with earlier requests and\nconnections.  For example, Jeff&#39;s authentication scheme is intended to meet the\nrequirement for correlation.\n\n&gt; Note that as soon as you do a callback you are exposing the fact that\n&gt; you are running software that accepts HTTP connections. I could see that\n&gt; as having security implications if that software is poorly written but\n&gt; there isn&#39;t much we can do about that.\n\nYeah, this is why I said that server socket implementations were already\nnecessarily paranoid and that would have to be good enough.  But after a few\ndays of mulling over my message about security, your proposal about\nprotocol-level support for callbacks, and my earlier message about\napplication-level support for callbacks, I have changed my mind.  I now believe\nthat callback schemes must avoid a requirement that sinks act as HTTP/1.1\nservers.\n\nRequiring clients to act as HTTP/1.1 servers is a fatal security problem.  No\ncompetent security admin would let it happen.  Saying there isn&#39;t much we can do\nabout it is hand waving.  If we don&#39;t address it, we won&#39;t succeed at making a\ngeneral purpose notification facility available.\n\n(I don&#39;t mean by &quot;we&quot; that there is something analogous to a WG.  I mean &quot;we&quot; in\nthe sense of &quot;the cat herd nibbling away at the problem of HTTP notifications.&quot;)\n\n- Lucas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
