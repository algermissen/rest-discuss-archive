It is fully RESTful if you are willing to think \n&gt; of an action as a resource, instead of as a verb.  But REST says actions \n&gt; are verbs, and resources are identified by URIs.  In\n&gt;\n&gt;     POST sensorDownloadOperation/sensorId\n&gt;\n&gt; the verb is nominally POST.  But what are you really doing?  Telling a \n&gt; sensor to download something.  And that verb is in the URI.  It&#39;s like \n&gt; an RPC call, where &#39;sensorDownloadOperation&#39; is the procedure name, and \n&gt; &#39;sensorId&#39; is the parameter.\n\nI think you&#39;re just creating the monitoring context for examining the\nsensor.\n\nA side effect is that the sensor is sent off to collect the data. But\nit&#39;s still properly RESTfull IMHO.\n\nMaybe the URI suggests that it&#39;s a verb. But clearly the verb is\nPOST. You could also GET the same resource so it does have REST\nsemantics.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
