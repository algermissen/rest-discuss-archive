If it is doing lots of computation, talking to external \nservices, etc., then 10 seconds might be extremely performant, depending \non the alternatives. Compared to, say, 60 seconds it&#39;s really good! It \nall depends, as usual. For example, I have some services I use, such as \nchecking flight seat availability for a number of airlines, where I \nwould consider a response time of 10 seconds really good!\n\n&gt; However, if the rendered page can be cached for an hour\n&gt; and used by everyone, then the application can scale well despite the\n&gt; expense of the one render per hour by deploying a reverse proxy on the\n&gt; server as a caching intermediary (and any other intermediating caches,\n&gt; including the local cache on the client).\n\nThis is not really related to scalability, but more with performance. If \nthe above was *scalable* it would mean that as you add server 2-100 the \nrendering time stays at 10 seconds instead of increasing to (say) 60 \nseconds. Adding the proxy does help performance, for sure, and it also \nminimizes the scalability problems, but it doesn&#39;t change the \nscalability factors, as such.\n\n&gt; If a page is subject to access control, however, it will need to be\n&gt; rendered each time it is requested because neither the server nor any\n&gt; intermediate caches will know when the user might have had\n&gt; authorization revoked (and the Stateless constraint prevents the\n&gt; server holding session state about the user).\n\nAnd the question then is if the rendering has to check with a central \nresource for the authorization decision, or if it can be computed \nlocally. If it has to contact a central resource it is inherently \nnot-scalable, since adding 1000 more servers doing this check would mean \nthat the central resource becomes a bottleneck, which will increase the \n10-second rendering time. If the decision is local then it doesn&#39;t \nmatter how many servers you add, the rendering time will be the same. \nThat is a scalable system.\n\nThis is an eternally recurring discussion it seems, of performance vs \nscalability, and it is really tricky to understand what is what (I can&#39;t \nsay that I got it 100% figured out myself).\n\n/Rickard\n\n"}}
