It may not have all the fields in the=\r\n existing resource\n(e.g. the resource id, the creation date, or other serve=\r\nr-generated\nvalues) but it is usually pretty easy to see that this entity\nr=\r\nepresents a resource. The media types I use for these entities is\noften app=\r\nlication/x-www-form-urlencoded, but I sometimes use\napplication/xml, applic=\r\nation/{my-media-type}+xml, or JSON\nrepresentations, etc.\n\nPATCH\nIn the case=\r\n of #2, the entity body I transfer contains a\nrepresentation of a &quot;DIFF&quot; fo=\r\nrmat that has instructions on how to\npartially modify the existing resource=\r\n. It is, essentially, a bag of\ninstructions on how to handle a modification=\r\n of select elements of the\nresource. It doesn&#39;t look anything like the exis=\r\nting resource. I\ncurrently use a simple XML format as the custom media type=\r\n for this\nwork. I use this XML diff format without regard to the native (or=\r\n\nnegotiated) media type used for responses for the target resource.\n\nI&#39;ve a=\r\nlso used the PATCH w/ DIFF pattern to apply to a set of\nresources on the ta=\r\nrget serer (e.g. &quot;replace discount rate on all\ntwelve instances of product =\r\nX in the catalog&quot;, etc.).\n\nIn cases where the target server does not suppor=\r\nt the PATCH verb (but\n_does_ support the application/diff+xml media type), =\r\nthe server will\nsupport POST + checksum on a special URI (/products/;patch)=\r\n. This can\nbe less desirable cache-wise, but works just fine for most cases=\r\n.\n\nFINAL REMARKS\nI keep these two separate (PUT=3Dreplace, PATCH=3Damend) p=\r\nrimarily to make\nit easier for devs to know what to expect for each case. W=\r\nhen you want\nto amend a view items for an existing resource, use PATCH and =\r\nthe DIFF\nformat. When you want to simply replace an existing resource, just=\r\n use\nPUT and the usual entity formats.\n\nHopefully this gives you some ideas=\r\n on how to handle your cases.\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\nhttp://twitter=\r\n.com@mamund\nhttp://mamund.com/foaf.rdf#me\n\n\n#RESTFest 2010\nhttp://rest-fest=\r\n.googlecode.com\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Apr 12, 2011 at 14:30, Bryan Taylor &lt;bryan_w_ta=\r\nylor@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve been pondering whether or not it is OK to u=\r\nse PUT for a partial update of a\n&gt; resource. When I look at the HTTP spec i=\r\nt says &quot;The PUT method requests that the\n&gt; enclosed entity be stored under =\r\nthe =A0 =A0supplied Request-URI.&quot; This seems to be a\n&gt; little loosy goosy t=\r\no me, as the entity is a represenation and the Request-URI\n&gt; identifies a r=\r\nesource and so the thing I create (the resource) is logically\n&gt; different t=\r\nhan one particular representation of it. To illustrate this, suppose\n&gt; my m=\r\nedia type allows an optional create-timestamp field and my server supplies\n=\r\n&gt; the value using its own clock if the resource does not already exist. I m=\r\night\n&gt; want to allow PUT operations to do updates, but not allow them to in=\r\nclude the\n&gt; create-timestamp. In fact, I might explicitly define in the med=\r\nia type that PUT\n&gt; requests will be rejected if they include the create-tim=\r\nestamp.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t think this violates any requirement for PUT that I can =\r\nfind.\n&gt; Specifically, I don&#39;t think I see anything that requires that a if =\r\nI put\n&gt; representation X to resource Y and follow it by a GET that I have t=\r\no get back\n&gt; the same representation. In fact, I don&#39;t think anything requi=\r\nres that if I use\n&gt; PUT I have to support GET at all, let alone with the sa=\r\nme media type, let alone\n&gt; with the same representation provided by PUT. Al=\r\nl that I see required is that\n&gt; PUT is idempotent and that the enclosed ent=\r\nity be stored under the =A0 =A0supplied\n&gt; Request-URI, which doesn&#39;t seem (=\r\nto me) to imply that it must be all that is\n&gt; stored. I would think that ea=\r\nch media type can define the semantics of PUT in\n&gt; terms of how resource st=\r\nate is affected.\n&gt;\n&gt; If the above create-timestamp is OK, then why not PUT =\r\nfor wholesale partial\n&gt; updates? If I create a car resource with an engine =\r\nwithin its state and then I\n&gt; PUT a new engine why can I not expect to stor=\r\ne this engine under the original\n&gt; car resource, so that a subsequent GET r=\r\neturns the car?\n&gt;\n&gt; Sam Ruby in his blog\n&gt; http://intertwingly.net/blog/200=\r\n8/02/15/Embrace-Extend-then-Innovate wrote\n&gt; &quot;Having some servers interpret=\r\n the removal of elements (such as content) as a\n&gt; modification, and others =\r\ninterpret the requests in such a way that elided\n&gt; elements are to be left =\r\nalone is hardly uniform or self-descriptive.&quot; I think\n&gt; this is easily disp=\r\nosed of. It isn&#39;t the server that interprets what to do, it\n&gt; should be def=\r\nined by the media type.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; What do other people think of PUT for partial=\r\n updates?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
