I think a lot of the current discussion focuses on &quot;how to do \n&gt; &gt; RPC in REST&quot; rather than &quot;use cases for which REST is a clear \n&gt; &gt; advantage&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yep.\n\nI think this mischaracterisizes the original discussion a \nbit.  The underlying issue was more along the lines of how \nto *avoid doing* RPC in REST.\n\nIf there are &quot;use cases for which REST is a clear advantage,&quot; this \nwould imply that there are cases where it isn&#39;t.  What are those\ncases?\n\nUnderstanding what those boundaries are (and I can&#39;t think of any) \nwould be very illuminating.\n\n\n"}}
