That&#39;s brave ...\n&gt;\n&gt; Still, that doesn&#39;t affect my point, such as it was: there&#39;s code, and\n&gt; there&#39;s somewhere for it to go.\n\nAt some high enough level of abstraction that may be a meaningful thing \nto say, but at the coding level there is a big difference between XSLT \nand &quot;ordinary code&quot;. For one thing, XSLT was designed specifically to \nwork with XML input, output and the flat namespace model used in REST \nweb services. No other language has that characteristic.\n\nLet&#39;s turn the question around. If there is really no difference between \ntheir REST and SOAP versions of the Web Service then why do you think \nthat the REST one has this feature while the SOAP one does not? How \nwould you even propose to implement a similar feature for a SOAP RPC \ninterface? &quot;Upload Javascript using a SOAP library and we&#39;ll run it on \nour server?&quot; That seems quite unlikely, inefficient, hard to secure and \ngenerally ugly.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
