As long as they\ndon&#39;t replace things that ought to be in the URL, they&#39;re as RESTful\nas any other header information the client might choose to send.  (And\nas long as the server recognizes that it&#39;s something the client\n*might* choose to send, but might not, and doesn&#39;t treat it as a way\nof storing application state.)\n\n&gt; Does it follow that personalization can BEST be achieved by having a\n&gt; cookie that contains the user&#39;s id sit on the browser and used to\n&gt; construct URLs for XMLHTTPRequests (e.g.,\n&gt; http://example.com/userdata/{user-id}) that will return data to be\n&gt; inserted into the page?\n\n&quot;Best&quot; probably depends on the particular application (it&#39;s perhaps\nnot &quot;best&quot; if you consider HTTP transactions expensive, for instance,\nsince it requires a separate call for personalization data), but I\nconsider it a good way, and do make use of it.\n\n"}}
