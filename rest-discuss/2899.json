So we might have a conversation spanning \nhours \n&gt; but a transaction would typically be only the minimal set of \nmessages \n&gt; that must be grouped perhaps for atomicity reasons. \n\nEither which way, in business, conversations as well as transactions \nare about things that could be Web resources with URIs, and likewise \nspeech acts in a conversation could have URIs and be referenced from \nfuture speech acts.\n\n&gt; Nevertheless, I do \n&gt; see some competition between the notions of statelessness and \n&gt; cross-message transaction identifiers.\n\nBoth conversations and transactions are inherently stateful.  But I \nthink the state of the conversation and transaction can be \nrepresented by Web resources in very much the ways you have outlined \nin several articles, unless I really misunderstood.\n\nSo where do you see the competition coming in?\n\n\n\n\n"}}
