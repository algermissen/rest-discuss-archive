There are a lot of people that are\nmore than willing to look at designs, tools, and technology & make\nsuggestions for improvements based on aspects of REST, and often based on\nHTTP implementation details.\n\nSo it&#39;s more of a &quot;We&#39;re here to help.&quot; rather than &quot;You&#39;re not a member of\nthe club&quot; type of thing.\nEndorsement comes from the community using the tools and from the tools\nfollowing community developed specifications (like HTTP, SMTP, DNS, etc).\n\n"}}
