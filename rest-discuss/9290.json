ETag = MD5.  If I want to change \n&lt;dt&gt;State Song&lt;/dt&gt; to &lt;dt&gt;Song&lt;/dt&gt; why do I care if someone has, in \nthe meantime, appended &lt;dd&gt;Rocky Mountain High&lt;/dd&gt; under &lt;dt&gt;State \nSong&lt;/dt&gt; thereby changing the source?  It doesn&#39;t change the ETag for \nthe partial resource I&#39;m interested in updating so it doesn&#39;t affect \na conditional PUT request.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;This is one of the attractive propositions of PATCH:  Presumably the \n&gt;etag you use is the one for the entire resource, even though you&#39;re only \n&gt;updating a subset.  This is useful.  It&#39;s also one of the requirements \n&gt;for Web3S apparently (they allow ETags to apply to URL hierarchies to \n&gt;solve the issue).\n&gt;\n\nBut the overriding purpose of PATCH is to save bytes over using PUT.  If \nwe can conceive a way to update XML trees without the PATCH message body \ntaking more bytes than using an XPointer query as I&#39;ve described then \nthere is no reason to implement PATCH for XML updates.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
