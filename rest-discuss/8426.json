You build the documents according to a recipe you read in a\n&gt; &gt; spec, and submit them to urls you get by parsing hypertext.\n&gt;\n&gt; You mean like how you can read the recipe for interacting with a form in\n&gt; I don&#39;t know, is it 3, specs?\n&gt;\n\nUnsure if you mean there are 3 specs that define from fields\nsemantics? Or just 3 specs touching on HTML forms?\n\n&gt; &gt; By\n&gt; &gt; agreement we know that you can POST an &lt;entry&gt; document to the url\n&gt; &gt; designited by rel=something. But on the web you get an HTML form from\n&gt; &gt; an URL and the form tells you how to form the submission and where to\n&gt; &gt; POST it.\n&gt;\n&gt; The form tells you no such thing. What you are ascribing to forms is a\n&gt; kind of gensym fallacy rather than any improved expressive power. See my\n&gt; post elsewhere about self-description. IOW, I&#39;d like to see the argument\n&gt; that  says forms are in a different language class than APP.\n&gt;\n\nRunning out of gas here, Bill... got a link I can look at?\n\n&gt; cheers\n&gt; Bill\n&gt;\n\n"}}
