And\nalso, I&#39;d like to point out that you can dereference URNs... various\nprotocols do exist and are in use to do that. \n\nI know the problem I&#39;m trying to solve is this: given a set of of HTTP\nresources, how can orthogonal &#39;metadata&#39; that real clients don&#39;t care\nabout be associated with the resources in a clean, simple manner that\ndoesn&#39;t involve radical alterations to the pre-existing web.\n\n- itdp\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, dave.cantrell@g... wrote:\n&gt; &gt;A URI, even an HTTP URI, that cannot be dereferenced nonetheless \n&gt; &gt;provides a unique name for an abstract resource that can be \n&gt; &gt;distinguished from all other names for resources.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, believe me I do get that point. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe I can re-phrase this somehow...\n&gt; \n&gt; REST is an architectural style for referencing resources across\nHTTP, right?\n&gt; So then, what good does &quot;urn:i-am-foo&quot; do me when I can&#39;t (a) GET\nit, (b)\n&gt; POST to it, (c) PUT it, or (d) DELETE it? How do these URIs fit into the\n&gt; scope of REST?\n&gt; \n&gt; Or are we talking about two different things? I can see their use in\nRDF (as\n&gt; mentioned in the original e-mail) as unique identifiers, but not as a\n&gt; REST/HTTP resource itself.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hmm... Maybe I&#39;m missing something here?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; -dave\n\n\n"}}
