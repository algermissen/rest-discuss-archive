None of which you could infer from the XML.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; There is a difference.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It&#39;s the difference between structured versus nominal types. I don&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; think you can say one form is better than the other without saying what\n&gt;&gt; the problem context is.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; For now, it seems that JSON works out by virtue of targeting a\n&gt;&gt; controlled environment, the browser. Perhaps it does a better job of\n&gt;&gt; defining the right subset of nominal types for programmers working in\n&gt;&gt; languages like Python/Javascript than XSD did (in its attempt to define\n&gt;&gt; a superset of types for all-comers). If JSON turns out not have the\n&gt;&gt; problems that SOAP+XSD did in the same places that SOAP+XSD has had\n&gt;&gt; problems, that might say something about XML. Until then, I&#39;ll reserve\n&gt;&gt; my judgment.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Generally on &quot;self-descriptive&quot;. The amount of information carried by a\n&gt;&gt; format is in large part a feature of what evaluates the format.\n&gt;&gt; Powerful evaluators would be things like Lisp interpreters and truth\n&gt;&gt; maintenance engines. After watching people around XML, then RDF, then\n&gt;&gt; REST repeatedly confuse each other, I find it helps not use\n&gt;&gt; &quot;self-descriptive&quot; as a term at all.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Another way of looking at it - if you&#39;re arguing up media-types as\n&gt;&gt; providing &quot;self-description&quot;, you should really be jumping into RDF and\n&gt;&gt; web interlingua; they do so much more and thus will provide even more\n&gt;&gt; &quot;self-description&quot;. Likewise, if you&#39;re arguing up JSON as providing\n&gt;&gt; &quot;self-description&quot; you should be jumping into javascript and/or Lisp as\n&gt;&gt; they provide even more &quot;self-description&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; cheers\n&gt;&gt; Bill\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n\n\n"}}
