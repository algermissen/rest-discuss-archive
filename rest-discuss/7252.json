PUTting to it can \ncreate http://example.net/documents/procurement/procedure/version1.35 \nand make that the document you GET from that URI.\n\nDoesn&#39;t have to be done this way but:\n\nhttp://example.net/documents/procurement/procedure/version1.34 behaves \ncorrectly for GET (returning the document) and PUT (refusing the operation).\n\nhttp://example.net/documents/procurement/procedure behaves correctly for \nGET (returning the document) and PUT (updating the resource that the \nnext GET will return a representation of).\n\nhttp://example.net/documents/procurement/procedure/version1.35 behaves \ncorrectly for GET (returning the document once it&#39;s created, 404ing \nbefore) and PUT (refusing or 404ing as appropriate).\n\nThe relationship between \nhttp://example.net/documents/procurement/procedure, \nhttp://example.net/documents/procurement/procedure/version1.34 and\nhttp://example.net/documents/procurement/procedure/version1.35 may be \nexplicitly stated in metadata, a hypermedia document, out-of-band \ninformation, or not at all.\n\n\n"}}
