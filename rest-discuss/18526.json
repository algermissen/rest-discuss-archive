You can use these\nidempotent(PUT) and non-idempotent(POST) actions to send data bodies to the\nserver for processing of all kinds including comparing the data against\ndata on the server, logging for later use, etc.\n\nI often &quot;model&quot; actions such as &quot;login&quot;, &quot;ticket request&quot;, &quot;queue up a\njob&quot;, etc. as a &quot;write-record&quot; pattern. IOW, if you attempt to log into the\nserver, I might log the action (date, time, username, other context data)\nfor later audit review. When I do this, it makes good sense to use a POST\nw/ body to send the data. These actions often result in a new &quot;resource&quot;\nwhich hold the results of the attempt (&quot;here&#39;s your ticket&quot;, &quot;you job has\nbeen added to the queue&quot;, etc.) and sometimes this resource will be\nupdated/refreshed over the life of the job, etc.\n\nI think that would fit your scenario just fine. you need not save all the\ndata sent by the user (i.e. password, etc.)\n\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\nhttp://twitter.com@mamund\nhttp://mamund.com/foaf.rdf#me\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Feb 7, 2012 at 14:47, Kevin Duffey &lt;andjarnic@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt;\n&gt; I am trying to do the best I can for our API needs to avoid making some\n&gt; REST calls basically be RPC calls. I can&#39;t explain in detail regarding the\n&gt; company I work for as we&#39;re still in stealth/startup mode so I&#39;ll do the\n&gt; best I can to make sense.\n&gt;\n&gt; Our API uses HtmlUnit (Java) to &quot;scrape&quot; some web sites. Basically we pull\n&gt; down a sites login page, try some credentials that the consumer passed to\n&gt; us, and attempt to log a user in. It sounds fishy.. but we&#39;re really not\n&gt; trying to randomly log in to sites and steal credentials. The consumer of\n&gt; our API will ask their end users for credentials, pass those to us via a\n&gt; REST call and we&#39;ll attempt to validate the credentials are good, sending\n&gt; back a response to the consumer that they are good or not. However, as far\n&gt; as I can tell this does not modify a resource, or create a new resource on\n&gt; our server side. It&#39;s basically a proxy for a consumer app to use our API\n&gt; to try validating user credentials for different services. The consumer\n&gt; gets the benefit of being able to avoid having to do the page scraping\n&gt; and/or using other service APIs..they just use our one API and specify the\n&gt; service and pass the credentials.\n&gt;\n&gt; The problem is.. we cant use GET since you can&#39;t pass a body. I thought of\n&gt; query params for the creds, but that seems hacky to me. So PUT seems the\n&gt; logical method to use, passing in credentials (possibly other values too)\n&gt; in the body. Only, as I said above, we&#39;re not storing these values,\n&gt; changing any data on our API server side.. we&#39;re merely checking to see if\n&gt; what was sent to our API works at the service selected (lets say yahoo,\n&gt; gmail, etc). So I guess you could say the boolean flag of whether or not\n&gt; the creds worked changes..but that&#39;s not really the resource.\n&gt;\n&gt; So I am asking you experts.. how is something like this done via REST? I\n&gt; know.. from all the posts I&#39;ve read the past few years, I fit that mold of\n&gt; those trying to turn an RPC into REST. Essentially if the community was\n&gt; &quot;ok&quot; with using RPC like syntax with the ease of REST calls, I would be ok\n&gt; with this. Because it seems a lot of the community balks at using REST in\n&gt; lieu of SOAP and other RPC mechanisms, I am left to figuring out if there\n&gt; is some way to do this with REST.\n&gt;\n&gt; Feel free to slap me around a bit if I am completely missing some key\n&gt; points about using REST.
