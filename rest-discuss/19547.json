POST means POST, it cannot mean &#39;publish =\r\nthe source resource&#39;. DELETE means DELETE, it cannot mean &#39;unpublish the th=\r\ne source resource&#39;.\n&gt;\n\nWell, those methods have a general meaning within th=\r\ne uniform\ninterface of HTTP whose purpose is to add to the self-descriptive=\r\nness\nof messages and, in doing so, to afford intermediation across the\nsyst=\r\nem (e.g. web caching). The HTTP method definitions attribute\nmeaning design=\r\ned for this purpose (e.g. establishing safety,\nidempotency, cacheability, e=\r\ntc).\n\nProvided the link relations are not in conflict with the HTTP\ndefinit=\r\nions, and are merely qualifying the details of methods within\nthe context o=\r\nf a given transition, then it is wrong to think about\nthat in terms of &quot;red=\r\nefinition&quot;. It&#39;s qualification.\n\nIn practice, it&#39;s much easier for consumin=\r\ng parties if your\ndocumentation is specific by providing an explicit descri=\r\nption of the\nmeaning and structure of the various requests possible over a =\r\ngiven\nlink. Leaving your documentation so abstract that the reader is left\n=\r\nwith the task of inferring every part of each possible request does\nnot see=\r\nm like a very pragmatic approach for custom link relations (but\nmay be more=\r\n appropriate for standardised link relations).\n\n\n&gt; If you find yourself in =\r\na situation that you absolutely must tell the client developer this, rephra=\r\nse the hypermedia semantic (here: the link rel spec).\n&gt;\n&gt; There is nothing =\r\nto say againts hints regarding the intended &#39;canonical&#39; use case but I can =\r\nalways only be a hint. AtomPub is an example, where the spec tells us so mu=\r\nch about the interactions between client and server that it looks like a pr=\r\notocol when it is actually only hints about a canonical application flow. F=\r\nocussing on resource semantics would have been much nicer, IMHO.\n&gt;\n&gt; One si=\r\nmply cannot constrain HTTP servers that way and still have REST.\n&gt;\n\nThe imp=\r\nortance of HTTP methods from a REST point of view is that they\ncreate **som=\r\ne** visibility of the client server interactions, so that\nthe messages can =\r\nbe understood to _a certain extent_ by\nintermediaries. Provided that visibi=\r\nlity is not impacted (i.e. a link\nrel&#39;s qualification of a method doesn&#39;t _=\r\nconflict_ with HTTP&#39;s)  then\nhow does this have any bearing on the &quot;RESTful=\r\nness&quot; of the\napplication?\n\nCheers,\nM\n\n"}}
