If the publisher of a product\nexposes the &#39;short name&#39;, then they could just as easily expose the full uri\n(but if we can&#39;t get them to expose the full uri, what are we to do?).\n\nThe associations between resources still cause a well-known name to be\nused - but it is truly a name like &#39;availability&#39; and not a value like\n&#39;blueshoes&#39;.\n\n-- http://www.myinventory.foo/products/blueshoes/ --\n&lt;product&gt;\n&lt;availability&gt;http://www.myinventory.foo/products/blueshoes/availability/?wh\nen=tomorrow&lt;/availability&gt;\n&lt;!-- OR --&gt;\n&lt;availability&gt;http://www.myinventory.com/services/availablequantity?product=\nhttp://www.myinventory.com/product/blueshoe&when=tomorrow&lt;/availability&gt;\n&lt;/product&gt;\n\nThe hyperlinking approach lets the URIs be completely unrelated - they can\nbe &#39;path based&#39; or &#39;service based&#39; at the whim of the implementor. The\n&#39;coordinating interface&#39; becomes the names used to extract the values from\nthe mass of xml (or rdf or whatever).\n\nA question:\n - what kind of server implementation is required if the portion that emits\nthe &#39;product info&#39; needs to know the full uri of the portion that deals with\n&#39;availability&#39; (it doesn&#39;t of course have to be an absolute uri, but\nwhatever the uri looks like, all parts need to be aware of it)?\nIs there a way to avoid this apparent tight coupling on addressing?
