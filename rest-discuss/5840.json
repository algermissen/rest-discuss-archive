All you are doing is giving the URI of a  \n&gt; service\n&gt; that performs stateless conversions.  The GET interface simply  \n&gt; tells you\n&gt; how to use the service (e.g., HTML form), there is no other resource\n&gt; involved, and there is no sustained benefit across multiple  \n&gt; invocations\n&gt; (no reusable resources other than the service itself).\n&gt;\n&gt; I hate to quote myself, but in sec 5.2.1.2:\n&gt;\n&gt;   &quot;REST components perform actions on a resource by using a\n&gt;   representation to capture the current or intended state of that\n&gt;   resource and transferring that representation between components.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; so what you have defined above is a one-resource RESTful service that\n&gt; merely reflects a different shade of state back to the client.\n&gt;\n\nSo, services (even those that look like verbs) can be stateless  \nresources, too, as long as they aren&#39;t implicitly masking -other-  \nresources?\n\n&gt;&gt; http://myhost.com/convert?format=pdf&uri=http//example.com/ \n&gt;&gt; get_it_here.html\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s a different beast -- it is a gateway, and it would &quot;look&quot;\n&gt; more RESTful simply by choosing a different URI syntax, e.g.\n&gt;\n&gt;   http://myconverter.com/pdf/http://example.com/get_it_here.html\n\nAh, I get it.  If, for example, it always returned the result as:\n\nhttp://myhost.com/convert?result.html\n\nThat would be non-RESTful (er, unprincipled? :-), because it doesn&#39;t  \nactually create real resource.\n\n&gt; It talks about resources, as in\n&gt; *re*sources, because that is what we want from a distributed\n&gt; hypermedia system (the ability to reuse those information sources\n&gt; through the provision of links).  Services that are merely end-points\n&gt; are allowed within that model, but they aren&#39;t very interesting\n&gt; because they only amount to one resource.  The really interesting\n&gt; services provide many resources.\n&gt;\n\nOkay, that actually makes sense.  I now officially have at least one  \nmore clue than I did before...\n\nThanks!\n\n-- Ernie P.\n\n\n"}}
