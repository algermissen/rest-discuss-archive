Regardless of the &#39;Basic&#39; auth-type\n&gt;&gt; being unsecure, why do so many systems use something else?\n\n&gt;As you suggest below, I believe it&#39;s the lack of a UI.\n\nMy two cents: In the systems I&#39;ve built, lack of UI is exactly the reason\nwe&#39;re rejected HTTP Auth. Two main problems:\n* usability: simple as it seems, the uname/pw dialog that the browsers\npresent seems to stump naive users. There&#39;s no feedback if you enter bad\ncredentials (besides the dialog popping up again), there&#39;s no help, there&#39;s\nno way to retrieve a forgotten password.\n* branding/look&feel: no way to control the UI. So you can&#39;t make it look\nlike the rest of your app.\n\nInsecurity of the Basic scheme hasn&#39;t been a big deal for a these apps:\nnewsletters, targetted prof databases, etc.\n\nGiven configurable client-side control of the auth UI, I think we would have\nhappily used HTTP auth for almost all these apps.\n\n-Lee\n\n\n\n"}}
