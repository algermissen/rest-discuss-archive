That gives us at least three\n&gt; resource collections /new-orders, /canceled-orders, and /shipped-orders\n&gt; (or /orders, /orders/canceled, /orders/shipped or ...). Stefan\n&gt; recommends that if a user wants to cancel an order they should post the\n&gt; URI of the new (open) order to the /canceled-orders resource, and the\n&gt; server &quot;moves&quot; the order from the new bucket to the canceled bucket.\n&gt; Whereas my instinct is to model the order with a status field, GET the\n&gt; order, change the status, and PUT it back. Leaving /canceled-orders and\n&gt; /shipped-orders to be read-only, convenience resources.\n&gt;\n&gt; I can see two reasons for doing it Stefan&#39;s way. 1. If canceling and\n&gt; shipping an shipping an order are unique business processes. For\n&gt; instance, if it is required that a &quot;cancel order&quot; request be submitted\n&gt; (and thus be trackable), and the request itself is a resource, which can\n&gt; in turn be approved/disapproved, retrieved, etc. 2. To support, as\n&gt; Stefan noted, the ability to locate the various resources/services on\n&gt; separate servers without any backend dependencies (e.g., a database).\n&gt; Both of these are valid, but neither are automatic. So my question\n&gt; again, is there anything wrong with my seemingly straightforward means\n&gt; of altering the status of an order or is it just another, legitimate,\n&gt; way of doing things?\n\nI see nothing wrong; it&#39;s just another way. Perhaps others would chime\nin?\n\nFor me, since you&#39;ve deemed that the status is important enough to set\nup the /{...}-orders hierarchies for reporting; since you already have\nthe bulk of the underlying mechanism to handle POST-ing to the\ncollections; then I&#39;d just do it for completeness sake.\n\nYS\n\n"}}
