The document is XML,\nand has fields for a title, body, date, etc.  The title is blank, but\nour app doesn&#39;t allow that, so the change isn&#39;t made.  What status\ncode should I use for that?  My two best guesses are 403 and 409.\n\n403: The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it.\nAuthorization will not help and the request SHOULD NOT be repeated. If\nthe request method was not HEAD and the server wishes to make public\nwhy the request has not been fulfilled, it SHOULD describe the reason\nfor the refusal in the entity. If the server does not wish to make\nthis information available to the client, the status code 404 (Not\nFound) can be used instead.\n\nThat seems decent...no amount of repeating the same request will do\nany good, nor will some other authorization.  There&#39;s some problem\nwith the request itself.  I can display the errors that prevented the\nrequest from completing successfully.\n\n409:   The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the\ncurrent state of the resource. This code is only allowed in situations\nwhere it is expected that the user might be able to resolve the\nconflict and resubmit the request. The response body SHOULD include\nenough\ninformation for the user to recognize the source of the conflict.\nIdeally, the response entity would include enough information for the\nuser or user agent to fix the problem; however, that might not be\npossible and is not required.\nConflicts are most likely to occur in response to a PUT request. For\nexample, if versioning were being used and the entity being PUT\nincluded changes to a resource which conflict with those made by an\nearlier (third-party) request, the server might use the 409 response\nto indicate that it can&#39;t complete the request. In this case, the\nresponse entity would likely contain a list of the differences between\nthe two versions in a format defined by the response Content-Type.\n\nThis is another possible code - there&#39;s a conflict between what the\nuser submitted and what is an acceptable state.  Again I can and\nshould return some error information.\n\nI&#39;d really appreciate some insight into which code is the best to use.\n Of course if there&#39;s one more suitable than 403 and 409 I&#39;d like to\nknow about it.\n\nThanks,\nPat\n\n"}}
