A URI shouldn&#39;t identify\n&gt;&gt; more than one resource, however.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; There&#39;s no requirement anywhere that there be only one non-paramaterized\n&gt;&gt; URI, and the rest have to use the query-string.  (There&#39;s no requirement\n&gt;&gt; that there be *any* non-paramaterized URIs identifying a resource, in\n&gt;&gt; fact.)\n&gt;\n&gt;That&#39;s good to know.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It ventures into the realm of general design, but why does your system\n&gt;&gt; need more than one type of identifier, anyways?  That&#39;s a design smell,\n&gt;&gt; to me.\n&gt;\n&gt;In fact, there is only one unique physical id.  The other &quot;id&#39;s&quot; are more \n&gt;like query parameters that interact with the versioning requirement, so in \n&gt;reality, a Logical ID denotes a collection of versions of a specific \n&gt;resource, where each such &quot;version&quot; has a unique physical id.\n&gt;\n&gt;MIght be an idea to use something like this for a specific resource:\n&gt;\n&gt;\t a) http://mydomain.com/resource/12345\n&gt;\n&gt;where 12345 is the physical (and unique) id, and have related collection URLs \n&gt;for versions such as:\n&gt;\n&gt;\tb) http://mydomain.com/resource/versions/314159\n&gt;\tc) http://mydomain.com/resource/versions/314159/1.2\n&gt;\td) http://mydomain.com/resource/versions/314159/all\n&gt;\n&gt;where 314159 is a logical id and 1.2 is a version.  If the version is \n&gt;missing, then you return the most current/latest, and if the version = &quot;all&quot; \n&gt;you return all versions.\n&gt;\n&gt;In this scenario a specific resource could have two different urls, a) and c) \n&gt;pointing at the same resource.\n&gt;\n&gt;That works well for GETs and seems quite clean.\n&gt;\n&gt;But it still begs the question of what you do with respect to creating new \n&gt;versions.  Put or Post?  \n&gt;\n&gt;Upon reflection, a Post to http://mydomain.com/resource/versions/314159 in my \n&gt;example above, could create a new version, and return both the version (1.3 \n&gt;perhaps) and the alternate URL with the new physical id.\n&gt;\n&gt;Some background for where this is coming from.....it has to do with design of \n&gt;a REST binding for the OASIS ebXML Registry/Repository specification.  \n&gt;Objects in the reg/rep have a unique physical id, but also have a logical id \n&gt;and version info as well (if versioning is used/turned on).\n&gt;\n&gt;Just trying to get my head around how to model the underlying resources given \n&gt;that we don&#39;t want to change the underlying Registry Information Model (RIM) \n&gt;that is prescribed by the current spec.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Andrzej Jan Taramina\n&gt;Chaeron Corporation: Enterprise System Solutions\n&gt;http://www.chaeron.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
