That sort of statement generates lots of questions,\nthe first being &quot;what is the Web?&quot;  If REST is an architectural style\nthat rests on certain principles, what are those principles, what\nmotivates them, how do they relate, what tradeoffs have been made or\nconsidered?  Asking such questions may yield many useful insights and\nanswers;  unf., merely studying The RFCs and The Thesis and The Paper\nand The Apocrypha often don&#39;t yield good answers.\n\nAll the following describe different sets with different relationships\nto each other.  By studying the relationships between these and other\nsimilar sets, it may be possible to produce a stratified scheme for\nassessing and categorizing the various principles that guide Web\narchitecture and consequently achieve a reasonable separation of\nconcerns with respect to architectural concepts and components.\n\nIs the Web:\n\n(U) ...all things that have URI?\n(B) ...all things that a browser can get, given a URI?\n(H) ...all things that a browser can get, given an HTTP URI?\n(G) ...the transitive closure of all URI-addressible hypergraphs (i.e.,\nlinked to or from)?\n(J) ...the transitive closure of all HTTP URI-addressible hypergraphs?\n(L) ...all things that are linked from some piece of hypermedia?\n(M) ...all things in markup-with-links, regardless of having\ndereferenceable URI?\n\nOpinions and drill-down appreciated.\n\njb\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
