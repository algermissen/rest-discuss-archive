Still, let&#39;s review what&#39;s in a URI.\n\n1.=\r\n A resource is not a URI. The URI is the identifier-name that actually iden=\r\ntifies a resource. A resource can be anything, and can have many names.\n2. =\r\nA client may not know all the names of a resource. Actually, a resource may=\r\n already exist with a different name the client ignores.\n3. The client may =\r\nhave control over the URIs it uses, but it should never had control over th=\r\ne Server URIs. \n4. I don&#39;t see why a resource cannot have a name not given =\r\nby the server, but I do see that a server should not be forced to name a re=\r\nsource.\n5. The client should not infer nothing from a URI. No folders, no t=\r\nypes, nothing. That is why I prevent from using templates. Too tempting. \n\n=\r\nSo, what all that means? It means you can use PUT with any name you want. T=\r\nhat is your name, the URI from the client. But the server owns its namespac=\r\ne, thus the resource may be created with the name the server likes. Still, =\r\nthe server can note that you, as a client, gave a special, particular name =\r\nto that new resource. So, whenever your client requests that URI, the serve=\r\nr knows which resource it refers to. If someone else, even your client, req=\r\nuests that resource using a search or something, the URI that will be retur=\r\nned is that one of the server.\n\nSee? The resource in this case has two URIs=\r\n. PUT has not forced the name into the server. The server keeps its autonom=\r\ny. The URI can be a cool URI client side, and use templates client side, an=\r\nd have a structure client side. But server doesn&#39;t care. It just polite eno=\r\nugh to remember your name for that resource.\n\nFurthermore. As I said, the U=\r\nRI is not the resource. You can PUT a resource with a name, but if the reso=\r\nurce already exists (the resource, NOT the name), it will fail. See? The se=\r\nrver can check the body of the PUT and if creating a resource from that dup=\r\nlicates an already existing resource, and that is not permitted, it will fa=\r\nil even if the resource you PUT has a completely new name. This is very imp=\r\nortant. We are putting too much importance into URIs, when they are simply =\r\nnames to refer to the really important guy, the resource.\n\nCheers.\n\nWilliam=\r\n Martinez Pomares\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Bryan Taylor &lt;bryan=\r\n_w_taylor@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve been discussing PUT for create with some cow=\r\norkers. This is certainly valid \n&gt; HTTP, but I&#39;m wondering if people consid=\r\ner it RESTful. It seems to me that \n&gt; giving the client control over part o=\r\nf the URI requires them to understand how \n&gt; resources are organized and fo=\r\nrces them to construct URIs as non-opaque strings. \n&gt; So I wonder if this c=\r\nonflicts with HATEOAS. It potentially also puts a burden on \n&gt; the client t=\r\no avoid namespace collisions, so that it must adopt some uniqueness \n&gt; logi=\r\nc which again requires application state that seems problematic.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
