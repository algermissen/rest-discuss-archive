The instructions I give to my team\n&gt; are that they should use PUT when they intend to replace some\n&gt; server-side state, and POST when they want to add to the set of\n&gt; server-side state. This effectively amounts to the resource recieving a\n&gt; POST doing what it wants with the submitted data, but attempts to\n&gt; exclude method invocations from being included in the data.\n\nRight.\n\n&gt; The content\n&gt; should follow the same rules as content you would use in a PUT and\n&gt; likely use the same content types. In particular, verbs should not\n&gt; appear. You wouldn&#39;t PUT a method invocation, thus it makes no more\n&gt; sense to POST it.\n\nI think it makes a lot more sense.  When you use PUT (successfully),\nyou&#39;re licensing intermediaries to conclude that the state of the\ntargetted resource was changed to that represented in the request -\nsomething that&#39;s not true if you tunnel.  If you use POST (i.e.\nPOST(p)), intermediaries aren&#39;t licensed to conclude anything,\ntherefore it&#39;s the best choice from a correctness POV.\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
