If it doesn&#39;t matter which you choose, then in\norder to get consistancy I&#39;m trying to pick one.  It&#39;s like saying the team\ncan have any color on their jerseys they want, but not specifying a color\nwould make the team look all tutti-frutti.\n\n&gt;&gt; since they have no architectural difference.  \n\nAgain, I&#39;m trying to say if at the &quot;architecture&quot; level you can&#39;t specify\nthen I&#39;m asking about a different level.  You know, choosing not to decide\nis a decision itself. ;)\n\n&gt;&gt; REST / not REST / REST-inspired / REST-derived\n\nThis whole set of distinctions feels much like a way to avoid allowing\nanyone to actually implement anything! :)  And I don&#39;t mean your\nimplementations, but in terms of the general guidance offered.  It&#39;s NO\nWONDER more people are implementing SOAP vs. REST.  ;-)\n\n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n\n\n\n"}}
