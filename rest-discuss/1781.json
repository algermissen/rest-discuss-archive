With your classification PUT and POST are only marginally\ndifferent, in that PUT &#39;&#39;SHOULD be considered as a modified version&#39;  of the\nresource, i.e. in its entirety, but POST can be a partial representation of\nthe resource.\n\n&gt;This is a subtle\n&gt;distinction, but IMO an important one:  POST isn&#39;t an arbitrary method\n&gt;dispatch interface, but rather a very specific method itself that consumes a\n&gt;representation of the intended resource state and acts accordingly.\n\nIsn&#39;t that classification exactly the same as PUT?\n\n\n&gt;As with many of these issues, though, this is so subtle and slippery that in\n&gt;practice I find myself violating it all the time. ;-)\n\nIMHO that is a huge problem for REST and it may be an insurmountable one -\nthere is no canonical answer. This may be symptomatic of the fact that the\nlimited verb count means that you invariably have to overload/overlay many\nmeanings on top of them, so many in fact that their usefulness becomes diluted.\n\n&gt;In WebKit, ...\n\nWebkit == Webware (http://webware.sourceforge.net/) ?\n\n&gt;Trying to practice what I preach,\n\nTrying to find something to practice!\n\nRobert\n\n\n"}}
