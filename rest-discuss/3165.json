This keeps you from\nhaving to get the entire resource.\n\n2) There is nothing in REST that says the URI must identify a specific\ndirectory location.  As a result, you could create the necessary URIs up\nfront and just keep an internal map to the actual location.  If the server\nwants to move an attachment, it just needs to update the map.  The URI will\nstill &quot;point to&quot;  the attachment (i.e. the resource/representation isn&#39;t any\ndifferent).  If you are doing this across multiple web servers, you could\nalso use the map table to instead return an appropriate HTTP 301 &quot;Moved\nPermanently&quot; or 302 &quot;Found&quot; to redirect the client to the actual URI.\n\n3) I am uneasy about the range feature of HTTP.  It doesn&#39;t feel very\nextensible to me (e.g. if you message format changed, range calculations\nwould have to change as well).\n\n4) (this is more of a question to the whole list) Would it be RESTful to\nmaintain a resource whose response to a GET only contained the new items?\nFor instance, suppose after each successful GET of a mail message, the\nclient were to POST the URI to this resource.  On a GET of this resource,\nthe server would return all message URIs for which it had not been notified\nof by the POST(s).  This technique would also obviate the need for the HTTP\nrange technique.\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;S.

There may be a large\n&gt; number of messages and, ideally, I only want the\n&gt; client to retrieve new messages.\n&gt;\n&gt; Again, my initial instinct here was that I could\n&gt; use range-headers (because the mailbox only\n&gt; grows), but, even if I just return metadata, I\n&gt; want to give the server the option of moving the\n&gt; actual messages to different URLs.\n&gt;\n&gt; Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the new\n&gt; URL will have the same length as the old.  So\n&gt; changing all the URLs in the folder could\n&gt; radically change its length, thereby precluding\n&gt; use of range headers to get new messages.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does this make sense now?\n&gt;\n&gt; -Alex-\n&gt;\n&gt; PS I really want the server to be able to choose\n&gt; on a per-message basis whether to return the\n&gt; whole message or simply a URL but URL changes\n&gt; illustrate my pount sufficiently well.\n&gt;\n&gt; ___________________________________________________________________\n&gt; S.
