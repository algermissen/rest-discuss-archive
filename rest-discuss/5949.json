Session state is\n&gt; therefore kept entirely on the client.&quot;\n&gt;   \nSo, is the &quot;diamond&quot; Bill suggested a piece of session state?\n\nClearly, the server is holding onto state, as each resource has a \nstate.  Requests from the client can change that state.  What exactly \nmakes something &quot;session&quot; state as opposed to some other kind of state?\n\nCan you give me an example of an application in which requests from the \nclient to the server do not contain all of the information necessary to \nunderstand the request?\n&gt; This is further reinforced in (amongst other places in the\n&gt; dissertation) his description of the process view:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;5.3.1 Process View\n&gt;\n&gt; The stateless nature of REST allows each interaction to be independent\n&gt; of the others, removing the need for an awareness of the overall\n&gt; component topology, an impossible task for an Internet-scale\n&gt; architecture, and allowing components to act as either destinations or\n&gt; intermediaries, determined dynamically by the target of each request.&quot;\n&gt;   \nThat&#39;s vague to me.  Perhaps I haven&#39;t done enough work with large \nsystems, but these statements don&#39;t help me understand any better what \n&quot;session state&quot; is.\n\n-- \nLyle Kopnicky\nSoftware Project Engineer\nVeicon Technology, Inc.\n\n\n"}}
