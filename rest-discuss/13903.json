Not a good idea, to me, to map address-port to a resource. It is to=\r\no static.\n2. Try no to think in terms of URI, but on URI ideas, if you are =\r\nnot using HTTP. You said you have your own protocol. That means the protoco=\r\nl must have a way to map resource IDs to the resources. In URI standard, yo=\r\nu have the domain (which helps the HTTP to route the message to the host) p=\r\nlus other URI parts which help the host to find the resource. Same thing he=\r\nre. Your IP Address may help your protocol to find the host, and some other=\r\n ID sections will help that host to find the resource.\n3. For example, take=\r\n this:\nmp:10.0.0.1:8081:id123\nThat may be our &quot;URI&quot;, where mp is the protoc=\r\nol identifier, then the ip address, the port, and the id of the resource. Y=\r\nour protocol handler will read the string, it nows the protocol to follow i=\r\ns mp, that protocol says to send a &quot;check&quot; command to the ip address and po=\r\nrt, for the id123 resource.\nSee how simple? Note that you also need to defi=\r\nne the operations of the protocol, cache, gateways and all that other stuff=\r\n that REST defines.\n\nWilliam Martinez.\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, George Ryan &lt;george.ryan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m looking into applying the RE=\r\nST architectural style to a binary network\n&gt; protocol, and I am getting hun=\r\ng up on how to identify server resources in a\n&gt; manner that would be true t=\r\no the style, probably because I&#39;m used to looking\n&gt; at URIs.\n&gt; \n&gt; For examp=\r\nle, would an address-port pair qualify as a resource identifier;\n&gt; assuming=\r\n one resource per pair?
