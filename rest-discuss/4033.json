(my hunch) that a URI may identify a resource which references\n    other resources by embedding their URI in its represnetations,\n    to arbitrarily many recurses of this indirection, or\n\nb. (probably Jan&#39;s assumption) that a URI may &#39;identify&#39; a resource\n    by inference, more like connotation that identification, which I\n    believe is a trap I stepped into yesterday in trying to navigate\n    this territory.\n\nWould you mind just clarifying that?\n\nThanks,\nWalden\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Roy T.
