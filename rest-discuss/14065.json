Most of the &#39;po=\r\npular&#39; REST literature (at least at the entry level), concentrates on defin=\r\nition of resources and resource identifiers.\nBut I think resources and reso=\r\nurce identifiers should always be thought of in the &#39;context of&#39; other cons=\r\ntraints.\n\nI was recently having a discussion with some colleagues about RES=\r\nTful URIs for website we are working on. We need to display universal produ=\r\ncts and regionalized products\nThe URLs are something like\n\nwww.xyz.com/prod=\r\nucts\nwww.xyz.com/product/id1\n\nWhen I said that, we should have separate uni=\r\nque urls for regional products like\n\nwww.xyz.com/region1/products\nwww.xyz.c=\r\nom/region1/product/id1\n\nSome people said that regions don&#39;t need be part of=\r\n URL and we can get those from user preferences in HTTP session, keeping ur=\r\nls same.\n\nEveryone was forgetting &#39;stateless&#39; constraint and almost assumin=\r\ng the existence of HTTP Session object provided by application servers.\n\nTh=\r\nats when I thought, if REST is presented as pattern language, with explicit=\r\n relation between patterns and stating which patterns are context building =\r\nfor other, will it be more useful to teach and design websites?\n\nThanks,\nUn=\r\nmesh\n\n\n\n\n"}}
