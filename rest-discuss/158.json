By definition there can&#39;t really\nbe an HTTP-level problem yet. Mozilla doesn&#39;t contact Apache and say:\n&quot;something&#39;s really screwed up over here.&quot;\n\nI think we do need to be able to differentiate between state changes and\ndeletions. Maybe a header? But a deletion isn&#39;t really an error. It&#39;s\njust a deletion.\n\nIf there are notification-related errors that we need to report then\nthere could be a header for them. In general, existing HTTP status codes\nwill not be appropriate.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
