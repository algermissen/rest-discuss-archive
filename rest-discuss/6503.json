A large\n&gt; &#39;object&#39; (server) with many &#39;methods&#39; (URLs-methods) returning &#39;structs&#39;\n&gt; without behaviour (representations).\n\nThink in terms of URLs (instead of servers): a small object (the data\nreturned by a particular URL) with very few methods (get(), post(),\nand sometimes a few others). The fact that there are very few methods\nand that they are well-defined is what makes it scalable. (Of course\neach retrieved object has additional &quot;methods&quot; that are determined by\nits mime-type).\n\nAnother fundamental difference between REST/HTTP and DCOM is that\nREST/HTTP is meant to be entirely stateless. That&#39;s probably what you\nwere referring to earlier when you complared &quot;live&quot; vs. &quot;dead&quot;\nobjects. The &quot;live&quot; or stateful objects must be kept in sync between\nclient and server, which makes load-balancing and scalability a far\nmore difficult task.\n\n&quot;5.1.3 Stateless - [...] This constraint induces the properties of\nvisibility, reliability, and scalability. Visibility is improved\nbecause a monitoring system does not have to look beyond a single\nrequest datum in order to determine the full nature of the request.\nReliability is improved because it eases the task of recovering from\npartial failures [133]. Scalability is improved because not having to\nstore state between requests allows the server component to quickly\nfree resources, and further simplifies implementation because the\nserver doesn&#39;t have to manage resource usage across requests.&quot;\n - Fielding, Roy Thomas.
