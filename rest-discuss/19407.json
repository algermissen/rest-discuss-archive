Of course.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; AFAICT very promoting hypermedia make the explicit point that hypermedia\n&gt; does not bring the benefits of REST without a dedicated media type.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, because generic media types only shove the problem up a layer - into\n&gt; out of band knowledge.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; By itself hypermedia just adds complexity; with a dedicated media-type a\n&gt; client can be built that &quot;knows&quot; what do with the links found in the media\n&gt; type\n&gt;\n&gt; Exactly. User agents *implement* media type specifications. And they offer\n&gt; users to activate controls to proceed from one steady state to the next\n&gt; through *their* application.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; but I see (almost?) nobody advocating this besides some cryptic comments\n&gt; from Roy on his blog almost 5 years ago.\n&gt;\n&gt; I do and others, too.
