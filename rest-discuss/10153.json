Here it is:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#TC\n&gt; P_segment_structure&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; You have to get every *bit* right! And yet the Internet keeps working.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have to say that experience has led me to largely agree \n&gt; with Berend here. I don&#39;t think the success of SMTP, etc. has \n&gt; to do with liberalness in what they expect; it has to do with \n&gt; being first, reasonably simply, and second, human readable.\n\nThis has become a continuing debate I have with the more advanced people on\nmailing lists, especially some of those in the HTMLWG.  The Internet is a\nglobal, participatory ecosystem and both does and should empower as many\npeople as possible. There are many layers on the Internet, and there are\nmany use-cases. \n\nThe developers who program TCP are some of the more advanced programmers in\nthe professional programming areana. To bring up TCP as an example is akin\nto saying that someone must possess the skill of a heart surgeon to bandage\ntheir child&#39;s skinned knee!  Clearly our collective health would be much\nworse if we had to queue up and wait to see the handfull of heart surgeons\nwhen all we need are anti-biotics. And it would financially devastate many\npeople as they pay the market rate for those highly skilled people. Actually\nthat&#39;s what computing was like back in the days that mainframes and\nmini-computers were all that existed; well heeled companies were the only\nones with computing, and everyone else did without. \n\nYes, at levels such as TCP and device drivers and O/S kernels, etc. one must\nget it right. The lower the layer the more quality and skill is required but\nthat is why we have many layers and many people making ever higher level\nlayers and making them as broad as possible; to empower the greatest number\nof people can participate. Not everyone is or even can be a highly-skilled\nprogrammer, nor does everyone want to be, nor should be expect them to be.\nBut *everyone* should be able to participate on the Internet and with as\nmuch functionality as we can make available to them. Not just the highly\nadvanced developer who are typically paid in the top 1 percentile of\nincomes, but everyone. \n\nMost people have real work to get done and real lives to lead that don&#39;t\nrequire or even allow them the time to become advanced at development.\nSetting the bar to be that one must be and/or hire an advanced developer in\norder to publish a web page and we&#39;d have no Web as we know it today. All of\nthose social and economic benefits just wouldn&#39;t exists. All those\nproductivity gains just would not have happened. The more you can empower\nthose with the least of skill, the more of these benefits and gains will be\nrealized.\n\nSo it is incumbent upon programmers of skill to empower those with less\nskill to be able to accomplish as much as possible.  You who work for a\nuniversity paid for by the public trust with a mission that includes public\nservice [1] should know this better than most.  It isn&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t just\nbe about making it easy for the elitists of development, the Eriks and the\nBerends, it is and should be about empowering as many people as possible,\nand that means being liberal is what you accept and conservative if what you\nprovide. Even if it makes your job harder; doing so will make empower that\nmany more people and is the right thing to do.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org \n\nP.S. As an ironic and interesting follow-up, here&#39;s a semi-related article\n[2] I just found that discusses the &quot;curse of knowledge&quot; which I&#39;d say is\nwhat too many of us on the mailing lists have, and we assume too many\nother&#39;s have the knowledge they don&#39;t, too. \n\n&quot;It&#39;s why engineers design products ultimately useful only to other\nengineers. It&#39;s why managers have trouble convincing the rank and file to\nadopt new processes. And it&#39;s why the advertising world struggles to convey\ncommercial messages to consumers. I HAVE a DVD remote control with 52\nbuttons on it, and every one of them is there because some engineer along\nthe line knew how to use that button and believed I would want to use it,\ntoo,&quot; Mr. Heath says. &quot;People who design products are experts cursed by\ntheir knowledge, and they can&#39;t imagine what it&#39;s like to be as ignorant as\nthe rest of us.&quot; To innovate, Mr. Heath says, you have to bring together\npeople with a variety of skills. If those people can&#39;t communicate clearly\nwith one another, innovation gets bogged down in the abstract language of\nspecialization and expertise. &quot;It&#39;s kind of like the ugly American tourist\ntrying to get across an idea in another country by speaking English slowly\nand more loudly,&quot; he says. &quot;You&#39;ve got to find the common connections.&quot;\n\nWhen experts have to slow down and go back to basics to bring an outsider up\nto speed, Cynthia Barton Rabe says, &quot;it forces them to look at their world\ndifferently and, as a result, they come up with new solutions to old\nproblems.&quot; Ms. Rabe herself experienced similar problems while working as a\ntransient &quot;zero-gravity thinker&quot; at Intel.  &quot;I would ask my very, very basic\nquestions,&quot; she said, noting that it frustrated some of the people who\ndidn&#39;t know her. Once they got past that point, however, &quot;it always turned\nout that we could come up with some terrific ideas,&quot; she said. Look for\npeople with renaissance-thinker tendencies, who&#39;ve done work in a related\narea but not in your specific field,&quot; she says. &quot;Make it possible for\nsomeone who doesn&#39;t report directly to that area to come in and say the\nemperor has no clothes.&quot; \n\nIn a way, I&#39;m trying to be that person who says the emperor has no clothes.\n\n[1] http://www.ucop.edu/ucal/aboutuc/mission.html\n[2] http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/30/business/30know.html\n\n\n\n"}}
