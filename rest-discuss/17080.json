Every set of name-value\npa=\r\nirs is clearly indicated; any client which groks HTML can generate a\nlist. =\r\n It is clearly described that these name-value pairs are POSTed\nto the targ=\r\net URI as an urlencoded query string.  Out-of-band\ninformation like how to =\r\ngenerate name-value pairs from the form code,\nis a commonly shared understa=\r\nnding defined by the media type.  What\nother information is needed to use t=\r\nhis API, that isn&#39;t in-band?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; In this example, my thought was that the =\r\nscript would GET\n&gt; &lt;http://www.iana.org/cgi-bin/mediatypes.pl&gt; and follow a=\r\nny redirects.\n&gt; It will then inspect the representation received for a form=\r\n (based on\n&gt; it&#39;s out-of-band knowledge that the page it is looking for con=\r\ntains a\n&gt; form).\n&gt;\n\nIt&#39;s going to take more out-of-band knowledge than that=\r\n.  I don&#39;t\nunderstand the expectation that a form be self-describing such t=\r\nhat\nit&#39;s generally usable by random, automated clients, as an argument in\nf=\r\navor of attempting such functionality through the minting of custom\nmedia t=\r\nypes.  Domain-specific vocabulary, i.e. RDF ontologies, seems to\nbe the fut=\r\nure direction; which has no bearing on media type beyond\nwhich ubiquitous o=\r\nnes to choose to represent the API as an active\ndocument.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; It would the=\r\nn construct a representation to send to the server\n&gt; by iterating over the =\r\ninput elements of the form, seting the values to\n&gt; ones extract from my wik=\r\ni (based on it&#39;s out-of-band knowledge about\n&gt; what the various fields in t=\r\nhe form mean).  It would then make a\n&gt; request to the resource specified in=\r\n form&#39;s @action with the method\n&gt; specified in form&#39;s @method and the body =\r\nconstructed in the previous\n&gt; step.\n&gt; \n\nWhy would it do that?  I&#39;d write su=\r\nch a client by first determining the\nname-value pairs the API is expecting,=\r\n tell it which associated data\nfrom the wiki goes where, and POST to the ta=\r\nrget as an urlencoded query.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; This would fail, or work only by coincide=\r\nnce, if a second form were\n&gt; added to be page.\n&gt;\n\nMy way doesn&#39;t fail or br=\r\neak, but continues to work so long as the\nserver supports the name-value pa=\r\nirs as POSTed query strings.  I don&#39;t\nunderstand the requirement that I sho=\r\nuldn&#39;t have to hard-code anything.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; It would also allow clients to work=\r\n reliably with more than one\n&gt; provider of the service.  I think this may b=\r\ne in line with Mike&#39;s\n&gt; approach of converting content into structure by sp=\r\necifying it in the\n&gt; media type.  (Correct me if i misunderstood you, Mike.=\r\n)\n&gt; \n&gt; How you would design such a system to avoid such coupling?\n&gt; \n\nI alr=\r\neady have?  Any service provider can support receiving POSTs with\nthe speci=\r\nfied name-value pairs as urlencoded queries, using whatever\nmarkup/forms la=\r\nnguage they want.  I understand what you guys are saying,\nwhat I don&#39;t unde=\r\nrstand is why this is a problem if a domain-specific\nontology (like GoodRel=\r\nations) exists.  With an ontology, the markup\ndoesn&#39;t matter, because clien=\r\nts are bound to, for example, @instance-\nof=3D&#39;foo&#39; rather than any markup =\r\nlanguage or structure, allowing\nvariation between sites with less hard-codi=\r\nng.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
