You are modeling resources as sets, and\nyou seem overall to be losing the distinction between resources and\nrepresentations, although in some places you have it correct.\n\nAlso, you have this inconsistency where at one point you say\nrepresentations will not be identified with URI, then you go back on\nthat promise by referring to a representation as a URI (which would\nbe wrong even if you referred to a resource as a URI).\n\nTo me, your model sounds like this:\n\n1. When you query a resource (via its URI) you will be given one\n    out of a set of representations. (good so far)\n\n2. It is convenient (why?) to conceptualize every representation, which\n    causes me to view it as a resource in my model. (still true to REST,\n    but beginning to lead you astray)\n\n3. Therefore, when you query a resource, I will give you a resource\n    from some set.  (technically true, but definitely obscuring the basic\n    REST relation of resource to representation at this point)\n\n4. As you can see from above, resources are containers for other\n    resources.  Ask for the box and I will give you something from in the\n    box, maybe what you wanted.  (misrepresents REST)\n\nIs this helpful?\n\nWalden\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Eric J.
