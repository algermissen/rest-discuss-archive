The reason\n&gt;&gt; for that is not REST or Web Architecture (though both are  \n&gt;&gt; specifically\n&gt;&gt; designed to enable it): the reason is network economics as expressed\n&gt;&gt; by power laws, Metcalfe&#39;s law, PageRank, and a hundred other\n&gt;&gt; restatements of the factors that place value on social networks.\n&gt;\n&gt; I understand how that should help search engines count how many  \n&gt; references there are for calculating page rank, but could you  \n&gt; elaborate how canonical URLs affect &quot;Metcalf&#39;s law, power laws, and  \n&gt; a hunder other restatements...&quot;\n\nToo hard to summarize.  This might help explain it.\n\n    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-free_network\n    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank\n\nCanonical URLs means that new links are created to the same URL as\nprevious links, which increases linked-to values, which increases\nboth the perceived node value of a hub and the corresponding values\nof the nodes that link to that hub.\n\n&gt; I did take the canonical URL thing to heart in our new  \n&gt; architecture. It may be a bit over-designed but we generate  \n&gt; controllers that canonicalize by dropping trailing slashes and even  \n&gt; reordering the query parameters. For example:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.artima.com/articles?t=java&p=4&o=a\n&gt; http://www.artima.com/articles?p=4&o=a&t=java\n&gt; http://www.artima.com/articles?t=java&o=a&p=4\n&gt; http://www.artima.com/articles?p=4&t=java&o=a\n&gt; http://www.artima.com/articles?o=a&p=4&t=java\n&gt; http://www.artima.com/articles/?t=java&p=4&o=a\n&gt; http://www.artima.com/articles/?p=4&o=a&t=java\n&gt; http://www.artima.com/articles/?t=java&o=a&p=4\n&gt; http://www.artima.com/articles/?p=4&t=java&o=a\n&gt; http://www.artima.com/articles/?o=a&p=4&t=java\n&gt; http://www.artima.com/articles/?o=a&t=java&p=4\n&gt;\n&gt; All get redirected to:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.artima.com/articles?o=a&t=java&p=4\n\nWhy don&#39;t you redirect to a permalink style URI?  The ? will reduce\nyour cache effectiveness, and is mighty ugly.  Well, I guess for\n&quot;give me a list of java articles sorted by title&quot; that is okay,\nsince the articles themselves seem to have permalinks.  Note that\n\n    http://www.artima.com/articles/java/index;date;p4\n\nis short and says more.  YMMV.\n\n&gt; Currently there is one URI that doesn&#39;t get redirected to the  \n&gt; canonical form. It&#39;s on my list to fix that:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://artima.com/articles?o=a&t=java&p=4\n\nYep, I have the same problem with aliases to gbiv.com.  Unfortunately,\nmy ISP seems to use mod_rewrite&#39;s &quot;final rule&quot; within the virtual host\nsection, so the easy fix doesn&#39;t work for me.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
