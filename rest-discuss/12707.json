I totally agree  \n&gt; that\n&gt; an XSD and/or human documentation should be sufficient.  People want  \n&gt; it\n&gt; though.  They want to be able to generate client stubs so that they\n&gt; don&#39;t have to hand-code HTTP requests.

Providing it as an  \nAPI description is &#39;dangerous&#39;, IMHO, as it creates an impression of  \nstability (of the interface) that REST is actually trying to avoid.  \nAll the client has to know should be in the media type specification.\n\nIf the scope and expected stability of the media type makes developers  \nfeel they need code generation - maybe that is a hint that the media  \ntype is too narrowly defined?\n\nThough, I also know all the argumets :-)\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Bill Burke\n&gt; JBoss, a division of Red Hat\n&gt; http://bill.burkecentral.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
