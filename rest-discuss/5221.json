It tells the system to  \n&gt;&gt;contact the device to obtain its state but it does not return the  \n&gt;&gt;state. Another URL is available to retrieve (parts of) the state.  \n&gt;&gt;The operation described in the example here (i.e.  \n&gt;&gt;DownloadDeviceData) does not return any data other than a result  \n&gt;&gt;indicating if the acquisition was succesful or\n&gt;&gt;not.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hmm...is that important to the client? Isn;t the goal just to obtain  \n&gt; the state? Why involve the client in anything that happens behind the  \n&gt; scenes? Do a GET on a the device resource and the return code will  \n&gt; tell you  if you receive a valid state or an error (4xx/5xx)\n\nYes, this is important to the client. The system supports many goals, \nsuch as retrieving data, and also to tell the system to connect to the \ndevice &quot;on demand&quot;. These are 2 separate goals. The on demand \nacquisition be costly and only done when the client wants it.\n\n From Jan&#39;s and Hugh&#39;s comments, here is an API that would fit well in \nour context. But would it be good rest practice ...?\n\n  http://server/acquisition/deviceId as POST\n    * Initiates the acquisition process on device which updates the \ndevice state\n    * Server returns 201 and a URL to the acquisition operation details:\n      * execution datetime\n      * completion code (completed, interuupted, timed out ...),\n      * duration,\n      * log info,\n      * URL for obtaining newly acquired device data\n\n  http://server/acquisition/deviceId as GET\n    * Server returns a URL to the last acquisition results for device.\n\n  http://server/acquisition/ID as PUT: not applicable\n\n  http://server/acquisition/ID as DELETE: not applicable\n\nAm I on track ...?\n\n\n\n\n"}}
