I just felt that the /s\n&gt; help to show the hierarchy -- but perhaps that&#39;s a bad\n&gt; thing if that hierarchy were ever to change.\n\nRight! That&#39;s exactly why the client shouldn&#39;t care about the URI\nhierarchy.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; maybe I should then make the query parameters more natural,\n&gt; for example, an email address could be identified by\n&gt; \n&gt;     v=&lt;vispid&gt;&u=&lt;userid&gt;&e=&lt;local-part&gt;@&lt;domain&gt;\n\nI think that&#39;s okay but see Jeff Bone&#39;s recent post. ;)\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; Sounds like a good idea, but feels like overkill for my\n&gt; little application.  Is there a standard for hyperlinking\n&gt; in XML, or would that potentially be something a formal\n&gt; REST architecture could define?\n\nThere are two standards (the nice thing about standards...) XLink and\nRDF. But they are probably overkill. I would just use an attribute with\nan &quot;href&quot;. \n\n&gt; If I used query parameters and hyperlinks, would that make\n&gt; sense, or should I go back to slashes then?  For example:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;visp&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;user username=&quot;user1&quot;&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;website href=&quot;/visp/website?v=xyz&u=user1&d=www.customer.com&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;email-domain href=&quot;/visp/email-domain?v=xyz&u=user1&d=customer.com&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;     ...\n&gt;   &lt;/user&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/visp&gt;\n\nIt all boils down to whether you expect the client to want to construct\nthose URIs. If it will always use the XML files for navigation then you\nhave complete freedom and would probably use the slashes. If the client\nis going to want to sometimes do navigation without going through the\nXML files then you should use query params.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; So I&#39;d change the resource of what&#39;s specified in the URI to one\n&gt; level up.  I would add a user by &quot;appending&quot; to the VISP&#39;s list\n&gt; of users. \n\nExactamundo!\n\n&gt; ... To create user1, I might do\n&gt; \n&gt; POST /visp/users?v=xyz\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;?&gt;\n&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE viml SYSTEM &quot;viml.dtd&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &lt;viml&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;user username=&quot;user1/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/viml&gt;\n\nRight!\n\n&gt; &gt; PUTs are okay for creating new things when there is a good reason for\n&gt; &gt; the client to &quot;own&quot; the namespace as in a content management\n&gt; &gt; situation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Well, in a sense my clients own the namespace, in that they\n&gt; choose the usernames, domains, etc.  Or am I getting my\n&gt; terminology wrong now?\n\nI would say that your clients own their names and those names are\ncombined by the server into the URI namespace. In a content management\nsituation it is only the human being doing the publishing who knows why\nthey put it in /financial instead of /development. \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Problems I have with my own design:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  - If I were a client I would expect to be able to send a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    whole profile and have everything provisioned at once.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    This is not insurmountable, just more effort (and some\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    thinking about transactional guarantees, if any).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; POST can handle that.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure how changing to a POST solves this one.  Perhaps\n&gt; I should break the hierarchy out of the DTD and define everything\n&gt; at the top level.\n\nSorry, I meant to say that a POST could actually create more than one\nresource. I don&#39;t think it violates HTTP semantics to have it do so. We\ncould probably argue about that though.\n\nThis issue of batch data sending has arisen before...there are three\nreasons to want it: 1. client convenience, 2. reducing network latency\nand 3. atomicity.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; I think this is what I was missing, I was thinking at\n&gt; the wrong level of identification because I had specific\n&gt; ideas about how POST and PUT should be used.  I saw\n&gt; adding a service as requiring a 201 (Created) response,\n&gt; which I would get from a PUT.\n\nNote that POST can generate a Created response too. \n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
