All of these APIs, thought more or less RESTfull in\nthemselves, have been informed by REST.\n\nIn itself that seems like a universally good thing. \n\nIt would be nice if they all adhered to RESTfull principles a little\nbetter but I would rather use a non-idempotent GET than SOAP any day\nof the week.\n\nAt least, by doing APIs like this, these people are showing that the\nmain architecture of the web (verbs and resources) are all that is\nreally needed to build APIs.\n\nAfter all, as a client, many of the advantages that would accrue from\nRESTfull design (scalability for example) simply don&#39;t apply to me. If\nFlickr want to spend more money on hosting because of their silly API\ndesign then so be it.\n\n\nIf we get really upset by these things we can always fix them by\nwriting RESTful wrappers around existing APIs. Maybe we should do\nthat.\n\nBut I am convinced that we shouldn&#39;t spend too much time worrying\nabout the purity of individual APIs.\n\n\nAnd I&#39;m not going to say the guidelines thing again. I&#39;m just not.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
