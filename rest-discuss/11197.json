I may b=\r\ne mistaken in my understanding of it, but maybe by summarizing those points=\r\n one may understand where I come from.\n\n2. &quot; A reserved subset of [a limite=\r\nd set of] characters may be used to delimit syntax components [...]&quot;\n2.1. &quot;=\r\nA percent-encoding mechanism is used to represent a data octet [when this] =\r\ncharacter is [...] being used as a delimiter of, or within, the component.\n=\r\n2.2. [Reserved] characters are called &quot;reserved&quot; because they may (or may n=\r\not) be defined as delimiters by [...] each scheme-specific syntax, or by th=\r\ne [...] syntax of a URI&#39;s dereferencing algorithm.\n\nAnd\n\n&quot;If data for a URI=\r\n component would conflict with a reserved character&#39;s purpose as a delimite=\r\nr, then the conflicting data must be percent-encoded before the URI is form=\r\ned.&quot;\n\nAnd\n\n&quot;characters in the reserved set are protected from normalization=\r\n and are therefore safe to be used by [...] producer-specific algorithms fo=\r\nr delimiting data subcomponents within a URI.\n\nAnd\n\n&quot;other subcomponents ma=\r\ny be defined by [...] the implementation-specific syntax of a URI&#39;s derefer=\r\nencing algorithm&quot;\n\nI will not quote anything about IP literals as they cove=\r\nr the host name and not the path, and as such are irrelevant to our convers=\r\nation.\n\n3.3 &quot;URI producing applications often use the reserved characters a=\r\nllowed in a segment to delimit scheme-specific or dereference-handler-speci=\r\nfic subcomponents.&quot;\n\n\nI think that clears up quite clearly that nothing pre=\r\nvents you from defining for your derefencing algorithms whatever reserved c=\r\nharacters are discussed in that rfc, provided they&#39;re not being used in you=\r\nr scheme.\n\nAs for the http scheme, I see no mention of reserving any of tho=\r\nse &quot;reserved&quot; characters. Even going back in time to 2396 I see:\n\n2.2 &quot; The=\r\nse characters are called &quot;reserved&quot;, since\n   their usage within the URI co=\r\nmponent is limited to their reserved\n   purpose.  If the data for a URI com=\r\nponent would conflict with the\n   reserved purpose, then the conflicting da=\r\nta must be escaped before\n   forming the URI.&quot;\nAnd\n&quot; Characters in the &quot;res=\r\nerved&quot; set are not reserved in all contexts.\n   The set of characters actua=\r\nlly reserved within any given URI\n   component is defined by that component=\r\n.&quot;\n\nHowever, we do see:\n&quot;The angle-bracket &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot; and double-quote (&quot;)=\r\n characters are\n   excluded because they are often used as the delimiters a=\r\nround URI&quot;\nAnd\n&quot;Other characters are excluded [of the non-escaped ascii set=\r\n] because gateways and other transport\n   agents are known to sometimes mod=\r\nify such characters, or they are\n   used as delimiters.\n\n   unwise      =3D=\r\n &quot;{&quot; | &quot;}&quot; | &quot;|&quot; | &quot;&#92;&quot; | &quot;^&quot; | &quot;[&quot; | &quot;]&quot; | &quot;`&quot;\n\n\nThe new RFC, which obsolet=\r\nes that RFC, says that : Section 2, on characters, has been rewritten to ex=\r\nplain what\n   characters are reserved, when they are reserved, and why they=\r\n are\n   reserved, even when they are not used as delimiters by the generic\n=\r\n   syntax.\n\nAll in all, those characters are used widely, and the previous =\r\nversio would have you encode them. But the latest revision has removed thos=\r\ne restrictions. Anyone wanting to see those characters enoded would have to=\r\n take the burden of rewriting rfc 3986, and anyone wanting to prevent those=\r\n caharacters from being used in their encoded form would have to revise his=\r\ntory and go modify 2396. \n\nPlease advise if I missed a fundamental point.\n\n=\r\n\nS\n\n\n\n"}}
