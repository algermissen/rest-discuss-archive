I\nhave ( as have others in the Jabber community ) wondered about Jabbers&#39;\nplace in the REST world.  \n\nJabber appears to have some of the key components for REST with URIs and\n a few of the RESTian verbs.\n\nIs it actually necessary for a toolset to implement all features of\nREST, or would the REST community be willing to endorse toolsets to a\nlevel of REST support?\n\nall food for thought IMHO.\n\nCheers.\n\n\nOn Wed, Nov 27, 2002 at 11:29:55AM +0100, Yannick Loiseau wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve asked few weeks ago about using Jabber as a protocol for a rest-\n&gt; architectural system. I haven&#39;t well understood the answer, which was a link \n&gt; to the wikki FAQ. Here are my thoughts about jabber (mainly from &quot;Programming \n&gt; Jabber&quot; Ed. O&#39;Reilly) and /reasons/ why it cool be suitable for rest.\n&gt; \t- Jabber is resources oriented: you can specify a resources for any \n&gt; kind of &quot;things&quot; in the jabber world. For &quot;human users&quot;, it could be the \n&gt; client on desktop at work, the client on laptop, the bot logging conference \n&gt; rooms, and so on. For a server agent, it could be any thing you want, e.g. a \n&gt; channel feeding rss, a room for conference transport, etc.\n&gt; \t- Jabber is full XML, in the protocol, the communications and the \n&gt; data. Even the storage is XML (it could be also a DB or an other kind of \n&gt; persistence system). Moreover, it rely on name spaces. Therefore it is fully \n&gt; extensible.\n&gt; \t- Resource management is based on few methods, such as &quot;get&quot; and &quot;set&quot;\n&gt; \t- All resources are &quot;browsable&quot;, that is you can &quot;query&quot; a resource to \n&gt; know some kind of metadata about it. For a service for example, it return the \n&gt; fields to fill to subscribe. It could be parameters required to submit a \n&gt; query, or whatever. In many clients, forms are dynamically built according to \n&gt; this feature.\n&gt; \t- The connection can be server initiated (i.e. push) which can&#39;t be \n&gt; done with http. This can be useful in many context, specially in asynchronous \n&gt; systems.\n&gt; \t- Use management and subscription (and authentication) is built-in. \n&gt; Authentication is included in HTTP, but the subscription stage left to the \n&gt; implementation.\n&gt; \t- As in http, communication can be secured with ssl\n&gt; Reading jabber stuff, I thought about other suitable things, but i can&#39;t \n&gt; remember them right now.\n&gt; It seems to me that all HTTP feature can be managed with jabber, but with \n&gt; other built-in cool added possibilities.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another approach... Does anyone here has implemented (or tested, or at least \n&gt; thought about) a rest architecture above Gnutella? I&#39;ve recently learned that \n&gt; Gnutella is actually extended Http. It could solve the &quot;push&quot; problem, and \n&gt; other aspect that I wanted delegate to Jabber :)\n&gt; I know that HTTP is one of the foundations of Rest, but take the time to think \n&gt; about these ideas. I hope I&#39;m not too presumptuous, and I certainly miss \n&gt; something. So please explain...  :)\n&gt; Thanks in advance\n&gt; \n&gt; -------------------------------\n&gt;   Yannick Loiseau\n&gt;  mailto:yloiseau@...\n&gt; -------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
