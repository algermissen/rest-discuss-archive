The problem with this, though, is that one can&#39;t  \nprevent people to use this not optionally, but as the default. Even  \nif they only use this for development, this means they&#39;d be using  \nsomething different for development/testing than in production.\n\nMaybe the right way is to not require an API key when test data on  \nthe server side is accessed, but do so in production mode.\n\nStefan\n\nOn Mar 3, 2007, at 9:30 PM, Chris Dent wrote:\n\n&gt; On Sat, 3 Mar 2007, Stefan Tilkov wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s a good reason, thanks.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Stefan\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Mar 3, 2007, at 12:45 PM, Michael Walter wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It makes it easy to explore the API in a browser (as would any  \n&gt; kind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of standard browser-supported authentication mechanism, opposed to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a custom HTTP header).\n&gt;\n&gt; How about both? Generally you want to enable some form of  \n&gt; strictness but\n&gt; also enable people to actually do things with the rather lame tools  \n&gt; that\n&gt; exist in the world. So anywhere you think you want to use a header,  \n&gt; you\n&gt; might also want to enable a way to dork it into the URI (query string,\n&gt; whatever). API key, accept header, and method are good candidates.\n&gt;\n&gt; Accept makes it easy to request other representations from the  \n&gt; browser,\n&gt; useful for debugging and exploring. Method is useful for situations  \n&gt; like\n&gt; Safari&#39;s lack of PUT and DELETE support in XMLHttpRequest.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve worked with accept and method, but not API key. We&#39;ve chosen to\n&gt; do basic auth and cookie handling but are hearing requests for keys so\n&gt; we may go that way too.\n&gt;\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Chris Dent http://burningchrome.com/~cdent/mt\n&gt; [...]\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
