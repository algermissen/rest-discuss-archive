We (cBrain) deve=\r\nlop software for governmental case file management.\n   2. The software is i=\r\nnstalled on location on different customer sites.\n   Each of the sites has =\r\ntheir own installation of the server side REST API.\n   3. We have a mobile =\r\niPad client that synchronizes selected case files to\n   the iPad for off-li=\r\nne browsing.\n\nDue to the way the central iPad app-store works this means th=\r\nat both our\nclients and servers must deal with all possible combinations of=\r\n different\nversions of the software: a new client may have to deal with an =\r\nold server,\njust as well as an old client must work with a new server.\n\nWe =\r\ndecided to go &quot;full monty&quot; and stick as closely as possible to the REST\ncon=\r\nstraints - especially hyper media. This means our clients have one, and\nonl=\r\ny one, single entry point to the REST service - and that entry point\ncontai=\r\nns a service document with links/link-rels to all top level\nresources. No h=\r\nard coded URL structure on the client. The rest is classic\n&quot;follow your nos=\r\ne&quot; links embedded in all resource representations.\n\nHappy moment number one=\r\n was this: a new, improved and more efficient,\nsynchronization mechanism wa=\r\ns introduced without requiring a mandatory\nupgrade of all clients.\n\nWe simp=\r\nly did what REST does best: introduce a new resource and add that to\nthe se=\r\nrvice document with a new link-rel. Now, old clients look for the old\nlink-=\r\nrel and new clients look for the new link-rel. This does of course put\na ma=\r\nintenance burden on both clients and servers since they have to support\nbot=\r\nh ways of synchronizing for some time.\n\nHappy moment number two was this: s=\r\nomeone decides to include some third\nparty stuff that happens to look more =\r\na less like a case file - now the\nclients should be able to synchronize and=\r\n show both the original case files\nand the new kind-of case files.\n\nThis to=\r\no was easy using hyper media: the clients make no assumptions about\nURLs so=\r\n they really don&#39;t care how the URLs look - and thus the server is\nfree to =\r\nembed any information it wants in the URL (in this case identifying\nwhat ki=\r\nnd of case file it points to). When the client asks for the list of\nrelevan=\r\nt case files it is then served a list of highly heterogeneous URLs,\nbut as =\r\nlong as any of these resources behaves as case file is expected to,\nthe cli=\r\nent happily goes on without ever noticing that new types of case\nfiles has =\r\nbeen added.\n\nSo what am I trying to say here? Well, part of the earlier con=\r\nversation\nhinted that hyper media might be overkill for mobile clients. I j=\r\nust want\nto illustrate the opposite: hyper media can be good for mobile cli=\r\nents :-)\n\nThe last happy moment also illustrates what (I think) was meant b=\r\ny &quot;*A REST\nAPI should never have =93typed=94 resources that are significant=\r\n to the client*&quot;\nin Roy&#39;s famous rant &quot;REST APIs must be\nhypertext-driven&lt;h=\r\nttp://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven&gt;&quot;.\nHad=\r\n the client known anything about the internal type behind the facade\nthen i=\r\nt would have failed when we introduced multiple types behind the\nfacade.\n\n/=\r\nJ=F8rn\n\r\n--047d7b86d6d8f81d3d04dbd5c378\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;I know I am bit late to the party here, but I would l=\r\nike to contribute with a small real life story about a RESTful API for mobi=\r\nle clients - an example which in my opinion illustrates rather well that hy=\r\nper media is useful for mobile clients as well.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The setup is =\r\nas follows:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We (cBrain) develop software for governmental case f=\r\nile management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The software is installed on location on different =\r\ncustomer sites.
