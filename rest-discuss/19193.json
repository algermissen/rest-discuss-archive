Welcome to rest-discuss!  ;-)\n\nHere, the archives are full of list regulars being told directly by the\nlikes of Roy and Mark dozens of times that we&#39;re wrong.  Gradually,\nthis group has become _the_ place to get schooled on REST as intended\nby Fielding.  There, I don&#39;t see many answers from those who&#39;ve put\ntheir knowledge to the test, here.  What I do see are attempts to define\nREST in terms of implementation rather than style, i.e. Wikipedia REST,\nnot Fielding REST.\n\nSo pick the place that best suits your needs -- there if you want\nimplementation, here if you want architecture; there is a difference,\nwhich comes down to the proportion of answers from those who&#39;ve been\n&quot;vetted&quot; by Roy (and Mark, and others) over the years, and understand\nREST as an architectural style as opposed to implementation guidelines.\n\nJust my two cents.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
