This is an\n&gt; apples-to-oranges comparison (possible more like \n&gt; fruit-to-apples).  There is\n&gt; no REST toolkit because REST is not an implementable \n&gt; specification, just an\n&gt; architectural style.  It seems to me that Dave&#39;s comments do \n&gt; nothing more\n&gt; than show he doesn&#39;t understand what REST is.  I would have \n&gt; given a bit more\n&gt; credit to his opinion if he had instead asked/answered why SOAP isn&#39;t\n&gt; RESTful.\n&gt; \n&gt; Interestingly, (while I think that Dave should know better) I \n&gt; think this is\n&gt; one of the bigger stumbling blocks to the acceptance of REST. \n&gt;  When I first\n&gt; heard about it, I too thought it was something like SOAP, \n&gt; XML-RPC, etc.\n&gt; This may be due to the fact that few people talk about REST \n&gt; separately from\n&gt; HTTP (at least outside of this list).  As a result, I believe \n&gt; many people\n&gt; look at REST as competition instead of just another tool to (possibly)\n&gt; improve what they are working on.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hey, maybe we all need to come up with a single e-mail sig that says\n&gt; something to this effect.  If we all use it, maybe people \n&gt; will take notice\n&gt; and get over some of the incorrect notions they have.  How about:\n&gt; \n&gt; REST doesn&#39;t make the things you use.  REST makes the things \n&gt; you use better.\n&gt; \n&gt; :)\n&gt; \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt; seairth@...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;Vincent D Murphy&quot; &lt;vdm@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Friday, November 22, 2002 5:18 AM\n&gt; Subject: [rest-discuss] dave winer on REST vs SOAP\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/11/21#restVsSoap\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; i&#39;ll let you draw your own conclusions about this; suffice \n&gt; to say i take\n&gt; &gt; anything winer says with a pinch of salt since reading his \n&gt; contributions\n&gt; &gt; to the recent RDF flamewar.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; found here:\n&gt; &gt; http://use.perl.org/~gnat/journal/9071\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
