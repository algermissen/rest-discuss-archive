It would be almost like having a Set-Authorization response\n&gt; &gt; header that could be returned from posting a login form, giving the\n&gt; &gt; credentials that should be returned by the client on subsequent\n&gt; &gt; requests.\n&gt; &gt; Does that make any sense?\n&gt;\n&gt; You should note that there is no design reason why Authorization\n&gt; and WWW-Authenticate are limited to Basic and Digest.  That is why\n&gt; those fields are extensible.  Why would you want to duplicate that\n&gt; functionality in another field?\n&gt;\nMaybe the protocol & existing software (user-agents & servers) do not\nsatisfy the use case most web site authors have in mind. The\n&#39;Set-Authorization&#39; response header suggested leads into what the real\ndesire from the community is - authentication tokens originating at the\nserver.\n\n"}}
