I wonder if this was the actual outcome of the\n&gt; workshop, or merely the opinons of those who volunteered to write it\n&gt; up. As it is, it is more a &quot;there are some problems with WS-*, but we\n&gt; can fix them&quot; rather than some discussion on how best to use REST as\n&gt; an architecture for behind-the-firewall systems.\n\n\nI suspect it&#39;s an awkward time to be on the WS-* side of the house. \n&quot;REST faithful&quot; is the giveaway characterization, and ironic given the \ndocument is published by the World Wide Web Consortium, which has an \nexplicit mission statement for the Web&#39;s potential, and that the \nconsortium failed to produce an architecture document of note for Web \nServices. That said, it&#39;s always interesting to watch how the WS-* v \nREST debate gets played out.\n\nI bet those trout jokes aren&#39;t so funny anymore.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
