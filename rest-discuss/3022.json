If there is really no difference\n&gt; between their REST and SOAP versions of the Web Service\n\nI didn&#39;t mean to imply that there was no difference between the two \nversions. I was merely commenting on your comment,\n\n&gt; People who think that REST and other ways of doing things are mostly\n&gt; the same because you can make them look the same with glue code\n&gt; totally miss the fact that there environments where there is _nowhere\n&gt; to put the glue code_.\n\nwhich I read as a claim that REST could do exciting things without \nneeding glue code or anywhere to put it. My quibble was that the XSLT \nwas the code, and (as it turns out) Amazon provide an execution \nenvironment for it. As I said, not all that much of a quibble ... just \na reminder that whatever the merits of REST, it can&#39;t do magic.\n\nAs it happens, with an &quot;XSLT execution environment provider&quot; you \nprobably could do something very similar with the SOAP service without \na great deal of difference in the complexity or overhead either on the \nclient or the server. But that&#39;s a different can&#39;o&#39;worms.\n\nHmm ... mobile XSLT, the new Java? ;-)\n\nCheers,\n\n\nMiles\n\n"}}
