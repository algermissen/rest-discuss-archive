What&#39;s perfect may\nnot be what&#39;s best. And, what already has high cache retention provides\nimmediate benefit that&#39;s unlikely to diminish, which newer options\nwon&#39;t be able to equal until some nebulous point in the future.  The\nbandwagon may have passed Atom by, but I&#39;ve never heard of it being de-\nallowed on intermediaries already configured for it; thus it is neither\nobsolete, nor without its advantages.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
