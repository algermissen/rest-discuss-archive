The next reasonab=\r\nle alternative\n(in cases where this compromise is not acceptable) is to dev=\r\nelop a\ncustom media-type and instruct the client developers to &quot;learn&quot; the\n=\r\ndetails of that custom media type and code that knowledge into the\nclient h=\r\nead of time.

That solution is\nto create a way to ma=\r\nke &quot;understanding a new media type&quot; easier for\nstate-machine clients. IOW, =\r\na way that clients can &quot;learn&quot; the\nsemantic rules of a new type by installi=\r\nng a media-type definition (in\nthe same manner that users install &quot;plug-ins=\r\n&quot; and &quot;add-ons&quot; in their\ncommon Web browsers today).

If that&#39;s the case, that means there must be some information\n&gt;&gt; baked i=\r\nnto the client that is used to &quot;check&quot; the representation\n&gt;&gt; returned. The =\r\nAccept header is one of these methods (&quot;I am a client\n&gt;&gt; that will only be =\r\nable to understand the following representation\n&gt;&gt; formats&quot;).\n&gt;\n&gt; I think i=\r\nt is important to be explicit about what &quot;understand&quot; means.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d rather=\r\n say that Accept means: &quot;I am a user agent that will only be able to sensib=\r\nly perform it&#39;s implemented goal if the representation has one of these med=\r\nia types&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Note that it all depends on the implemented goal. If that g=\r\noal is to &quot;compile a list of newly ordered items from those orders that I h=\r\nappen to be able to parse and report the number of unparsable orders&quot; then =\r\nthat would work just fine with Accept: application/atom+xml;type=3Dfeed.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; However, we must then understand that the eventual application state expo=\r\nsed to the user (the compiled list/report, maybe stuffed into some database=\r\n) can only reflect what the user agent was able to make of the feed. IOW, t=\r\nhe report might look like this:\n&gt;\n&gt; New Orders as of date foo: 201\n&gt; Proces=\r\nsable Orders: 11\n&gt; Summary of items in those 11: [some list of items here]\n=\r\n&gt; Unprocessable orders 190 [Reference to temporary filesystem where they ca=\r\nn be reviewed]\n&gt;\n&gt; (This might, BTW, just what we want)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; You can turn =\r\nall this around and say:\n&gt;\n&gt; When the server developer implements for appli=\r\ncation/atom+xml; type=3Dfeed it simply has no idea what special assumptions=\r\n some client will make.

How does the user agent detect t=\r\nhat it cannot perform its task but (despite having a perfectly valid answer=\r\n)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. What to do about that\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 1.:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Given the feed above, ho=\r\nw do we need to implement the client to report to the user (e.g. someone th=\r\nat at some point looks in a log file or someone that uses the business inte=\r\nlligence application that uses the compiled reports about newly ordered ite=\r\nms) that a correct answer was received, that it did indeed contain orders b=\r\nut that the list could not be processed as intended?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; First of all, =\r\nthe client trusts the higher level assumption that the resource indeed prov=\r\nides the list of new orders. This is the same kind of trust that any browse=\r\nr has when it follows an &lt;img src=3D&quot;&quot;/&gt; hypermedia control. The server tol=\r\nd the user agent something about the referenced resource and the client can=\r\n reasonably expect that to be true (otherwise we would deal with a broken s=\r\nerver and that is not the issue here).\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Since the client expects the=\r\n feed to represent the list of new orders, it is IMHO reasonable to assume =\r\nthat any entry in that feed points to a new order. No entries would mean &#39;n=\r\no new orders&#39;. This is IMHO not semantic tunneling through the Atom feed be=\r\ncause the assumption is backed by the semantics of the resource as advertis=\r\ned by the server.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; The feed appearently contains two entries, hence =\r\nthe user agent can be programmed to understand that there are two new order=\r\ns to process. When it comes to processing the orders the user agent will ha=\r\nve to realize that neither the summary nor the referenced content is availa=\r\nble in a format that is sufficient to extract the ordered items automatical=\r\nly. Hence the user agent has to report an error eventually leading to some =\r\nhuman action to fix the situation:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 2.:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; We reach question #2 onc=\r\ne the fact that a problem exists for the user agent has reached a human. Wh=\r\nat is he supposed to do? There are three options:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a) call the serve=\r\nr developer and negotiate a certain format for the Atom feed\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b) adjust =\r\nthe user agent implementation to handle the format received (e.g. parse out=\r\n the HTML from the summary or OCR the scanned orders)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; c) do nothing exc=\r\nept mark the compiled report as &#39;wrong&#39; or &#39;unusable&#39;. IWO, accept the fact=\r\n that the user goal cannot be satisfied\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a) Leads to coupling (if it=\r\n is at all possible/desireable to call the server implementor)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b) Does =\r\nnot improve the situation because the format can just change again tomorrow=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; c) is the honest option but provides no business value\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; In my o=\r\npinion, the only thing to really improve the situation is to standardize a =\r\nformat that allows the server developer to actually determine the user agen=\r\nt expectations (capabilities) from the Accept header. If we had application=\r\n/orderlist (or at least application/atom+xml;profile=3Dorderlist) the serve=\r\nr developer would need to either add a new response-producing method or sen=\r\nd a 406.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Does that sufficiently illustrate the point?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Jan\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; [1] and of course be true to be true to the server&#39;s own stateme=\r\nnt that the resource represents\n&gt;&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0the new orders.
