I assume that in both cases, you&#39;d return a  \nlist =\r\nof links.\n\nBeware of over-emphasizing URI meaning, though -- it&#39;s nice to h=\r\nave  \nreadable URIs, but they shouldn&#39;t &quot;leak&quot; into your design.\n\nStefan\n--=\r\n\nStefan Tilkov, http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/\n\n\n&gt; Any hints are highly appr=\r\neciated!
