And the concepts are very different:\nresources are / can be state machines that generate a\ntime-varying stream of representations (or at least they are a\ntime-varying stream of representations, i.e. for static content\nthat evolves over time) while representations are themselves\nimmutable and potentially mobile data.  The net effect is that it\nis difficult to name, sort out, and reason about the semantics of\nrepresentations vs. resources.\n\nPOST, PUT, DELETE, etc. operate directly on *resources* named by\nURI.  When I perform one of these operations, it interacts\ndirectly with the resource in question and yields an appropriate\nresponse / representation of the resource.\n\nGET, however, is more ambiguous.  In general, it operates on\n*representations* of a named resource.  This may or may not imply\nan interaction with said resource.  In general, GET\nhttp://foo.com/bar means &quot;get the first valid representation of\nthe resource at foo.com/bar that&#39;s lurking in the proxy chain\nfrom here to the origin server for that resource.&quot;  I.e., GET is\nreally an operation that&#39;s conceptually about retrieving\nrepresentations rather than interacting with the resource in\nquestion.\n\nThe rather fuzzy treatment of resources vs. representations is\nwhat leads to a lot of the bletcherousness -wrt- how we handle\ncaching, and a lot of the cognitive dissonance that we experience\nwhenever we bring intermediaries into the picture.  There&#39;s power\nin the fuzziness, but in general we don&#39;t have a very principled\nway to deal with all of those representations that we have\nfloating around in caches in various places.  (We&#39;ve got plenty\nof tools in the various headers and so forth, but the semantics\nare loose.)\n\nThis is really a sort of half-formed thought, but the distinction\nseemed rather interesting.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
