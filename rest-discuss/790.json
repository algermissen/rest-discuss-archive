And they aren&#39;t opaque to the\nservier, because the server has to interpret them. They probably should\nbe opaque to most intermediaries.\n\n&gt; ... With a POST you can\n&gt; have a URI with ?query as well as a body composed of name=value pairs - with\n&gt; overlapping names between the URI and body.\n\nThe ones in the body are opaque to HTTP implementations by virtue of the\nfact that they are in the body. An HTTP implementation shouldn&#39;t be any\nmore interested in the body than if it was PDF. IMHO.\n \n&gt; Perhaps I&#39;m just confused whether the &#39;resource&#39; is identified ONLY by the\n&gt; uri &#39;path&#39; or if it identified by the path+query. (and in html forms you\n&gt; can&#39;t specify whether some inputs are inserted into the uri or into the\n&gt; body)\n\nThe resource is identified by whatever goes after the method name.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
