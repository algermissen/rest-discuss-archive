Enterprises obviously are getting\nbetter functionality than that with EDI already.  But E&#39;s will reap\neconomic benefits with each electronic exchange by individuals if it can\nbe understood.  I am advocating that E&#39;s deliberately downshift from\n4th gear and try to speak in plain, simple, horizontal messages to SMEs.\n\nThere are at least 5 major problems with highly orderly Business\nProcess choreography, for SMEs.\n\n1.  I/SMEs constantly change their behavior and kinds of terms more\ndynamically and flexibly than Enterprise and their cost of maintaining\nBP templates would be too high.  The economic payoff from BP\nchoreography (granular state alignment) is greatest when you have high\nvolume of similar transactions.  I/SMEs are often the opposite.\n\n2.  Individuals and SMEs have so much role compression that the same\nperson often does most, or all, of customer service has no need for any\nexplicit, realtime computer record of the business state of the\ncollaboration or transaction.  So, they&#39;re simply not going to sit and\nmaintain granular diary of everything in a computer--Not now, not ever.\n\n3.  most of the Simple Examples, POCs, and implementations for ebXML BP\nare about supply chain for products or materials. The fraction of I/SMEs\nin services is so high that *no* BP solution can reach critical mass\n(viability) unless it wins adoption from services people.  In other\nwords, BP standards organizations should admit they have not much to\noffer services collaborations, and, perhaps start with a core\nfunctionality around simple communication, billing and reconciliation of\nAR and AP that is needed both by services as well as product businesses.\n(BP standards bodies are, instead, abandoning SMEs and sticking to their\nEnterprise spaces, afaics, which dooms their standard to niche status.)\n\n4.  Strategic.  By cooperating in supply chains dominated by trillion-dollar\ncorporations, the SME becomes truly a cog in a machine, bidding against\nworkers in Bangladesh. Knowing this, many businesses deliberately\nmisbehave and avoid adoption, especially since ebXML doesn&#39;t let\nthem buy/sell from their own neighbors or other SMEs, at first.\n\n5.  The biggest problem with highly engineered, granular BP\nspecifications is that they cannot succeed without a compliant\napplication on each end.  Even if the other party tells you their app is\ncompliant it could be noncompliant or could fail.  Particularly during\nthe early adoption phase, the level of reliability will not be too\nimpressive.\n\nSo, the thinking behind my suggestion is forget about\nchanging others behavior and just send them carbon copies of\nwhatever recordkeeping we are actually posting in our own\ncomputer, about them.   If they figure it out then fine.  If not,\nthen, fine.  http://www.gldialtone.com/UEEN.htm\n\nI have deliberately written this in advocacy mode.  I realize there are\ntwo sides to every story but feel these points are getting ignored by\nall the Business Process standards bodies and I&#39;m &quot;mad as hell and won&#39;t\ntake it anymore&quot;...   I want something simple enough to be understood by\n6 billion people, to be adopted, making millions of full-time\nbookkeeping positions as obsolete as telephone operators, and which\ndoesn&#39;t transfer economic or strategic advantage to Giant Enterprises.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nTodd\n\n=====================Quote material follows\nAt 05:16 AM 6/8/02, bhaugen32 wrote:\n....\n &gt; So you would\n &gt; \t-&gt; POST: &quot;I&#39;d like to make an offer&quot;\n &gt; \t&lt;- OK, here&#39;s an offer-holder URI\n &gt; \t-&gt; PUT the offer at offer-holder URI\n &gt; \t&lt;- OK, I&#39;ve received it and will get back to you\n\nOk, I read your Reliable HTTP article and think I agree.\n\n &gt; The offer should have a callback address, unless you are using\nsomething\n &gt; like HTTP events.
