It&#39;s the science you use to guide the long-term development of\nyour system.  I point to my online REST demo all the time, and point\nout the deliberate REST mismatches and the pragmatic reasons for them.\n\nThe system is RESTful overall, but certain aspects aren&#39;t.  Some don&#39;t\nneed to be, others will evolve to be *over time*.  REST is what allows\nme to perform a cost-benefit analysis of development time vs. release\ncycle requirements vs. today&#39;s needs vs. tomorrow&#39;s needs.\n\nThe point is that your pragmatic decisions should allow for evolution in\nthe direction of the Platonic Ideal of REST.  Otherwise you run the\nrisk of painting yourself into a corner.  You&#39;re on the right track, if\nyou start by modeling your resources properly, such that tunneling\ncustom verbs over POST isn&#39;t necessary.\n\nThat is all-or-nothing.  RPC simply isn&#39;t RESTful, and I see no reason\nto hesitate in pointing out that *fact* to anyone learning REST.  You\ncan&#39;t possibly learn REST if you don&#39;t understand this fact.\n\nStarting off with RPC as Google has done, paints you into just such a\ncorner.  It&#39;s a fundamentally anti-REST architectural choice.  That&#39;s\nscience speaking.  Building a system which evolves towards REST is the\ngoal, but that goal will never be reached if the fundamental decisions\naren&#39;t at least informed by REST.\n\nREST is _not_ &quot;mysticism.&quot;  Roy&#39;s thesis clearly explains all the\nbenefits and consequences of the style.  This is what allows cost-\nbenefit analysis of a system architecture which evolves over time.  An\nunderstanding of REST is what allows the comparative benefits of my\napproach to image rotation vs. Google&#39;s to be discussed.\n\nThus it becomes possible to rationally discuss any difference in\ndevelopment time between POST tunneling of custom methods, vs. re-use\nof standardized methods, against the scalability of the results.  Only\nyou can know your requirements for scalability now, vs. down the road,\nand determine what aspects of REST don&#39;t pay for themselves until later,\nor consider the costs of writing off your RPC system when it turns out\nthat you do need it to scale and don&#39;t have Google&#39;s infrastructure,\nand scrap it for a REST system that would&#39;ve been less costly to evolve\nover time.\n\nThere is nothing mystic about my ability to come up with a REST answer\nto Google&#39;s &quot;awkward&quot; assertion, off the top of my head, and have\nnobody on this list dispute it as being REST (if given a hypertext API\nto guide the user agent through those interactions, if the human or\nmachine goal is to rotate an image stored on a server), or a better\nsolution than Google&#39;s.  Which tends to prove that REST is indeed a\nscience.\n\nFollowing REST allows you to easily implement the standard solution to\nthe lost-update problem.  Following RPC does not.  Scientific fact, not\ndogma.  Falsifiable.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
