I want to leave the door open to add\naltern=\r\nate representations of the resources in my app. To do this, I\nneed to write=\r\n something that selects the mime type of the response\nfrom the accept heade=\r\nr of the request.\n\nMy question is which mime type should be selected when m=\r\nore than one\nhas the same quality value (i.e. q=3D1)? For example, below is=\r\n the\naccept header of a get request from a firefox browser to the messages\n=\r\nof this group (http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/messages):\n\n=\r\nAccept:\n    text/xml,\n    application/xml,\n    application/xhtml+xml,\n    t=\r\next/html;q=3D0.9,\n    text/plain;q=3D0.8,\n    image/png,\n    */*;q=3D0.5\n\nT=\r\nhe mime types text/xml, application/xml, application/xhtml+xml and\nimage/pn=\r\ng all have the same quality. Assuming the server has both\ntext/xml and appl=\r\nication/xhtml+xml representations available. Which\none should be selected a=\r\ns the mime type of the response? If I take the\norder of appearance into acc=\r\nount (the spec doesn&#39;t mention anything\nabout this), then it will be text/x=\r\nml but TBH a request coming from a\nbrowser should really receive a applicat=\r\nion/xhtml+xml response if it\nrequested it?\n\nOf course, the best solution is=\r\n that the browser send a better accept\nheader; one would think it would pre=\r\nfer xhtml, html and xml in that\norder. Pointless crying over spilt milk tho=\r\nugh.\n\nAny info, advice or otherwise would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks, K=\r\neith.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
