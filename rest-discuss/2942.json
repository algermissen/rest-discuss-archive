In regular usage of a\n&gt; Java SOA toolkit you would take one object and create a WSDL doc from\n&gt; it. \n\nYou take an object with static method and expose the static methods. \nYou can&#39;t take a family of objects with instance methods and expose the \ninstances.\n\n&gt;  The WSDL doc is a single service.  I would say that means one\n&gt; service represents one object.\n\nNow go the other way. I have a hundred instances being created an \ndestroyed at runtime. Whta does the WSDL for that look like?\n\n  http://www.blogstream.com/pauls/1032521623/index_html\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n\n"}}
