That could mean SOAP, XML- \nRPC, or [proprietary] POX.\n\nMore=\r\n importantly, I wouldn&#39;t choose a term based on what &quot;the  \nenterprise&quot; wil=\r\nl think of it. Don&#39;t think that &quot;the enterprise&quot; (or  \nhowever else you wan=\r\nt to phrase &quot;the other&quot;) is fixated on SOA[P] and  \nwill refuse to use a sa=\r\nne approach like REST simply because there&#39;s  \nnot a TLA for it that&#39;s simi=\r\nlar to SOA. Most of the people I talk to  \nin the top (execs), middle (mana=\r\ngers), and bottom (devs) in companies  \nhave much of this sorted out, thank=\r\ns to the work the REST crew has  \ndone over the past year or two.\n\nPut anot=\r\nher way: don&#39;t give up now on using a simple term like &quot;web  \nservices&quot; for=\r\n a simple idea like REST. Repetition is the way to  \ntransform language, an=\r\nd &quot;web services&quot; almost has all the SOAP rinsed  \nout of it.\n\nOn May 27, 20=\r\n06, at 11:06 AM, Bill de h=D3ra wrote:\n\n&gt; Dr. Ernie Prabhakar wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; W=\r\nhat do the rest of you think?\n&gt;\n&gt; I think you can&#39;t contrast SOA with anyth=\r\ning, because SOA can be\n&gt; anything you want it to be - for example I have n=\r\no idea what it would\n&gt; mean to be a subset of SOA.
