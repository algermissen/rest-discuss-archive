Simple examples:\n\n1) If get / -&gt; content-location=/secure/index.html and /secure/index.html lies \nwithin a protected security domain then the cache might fail delivering the \ncorrect page if it tried to retrieve it. \n2) Also if get /index.html -&gt; content-location=index_tuesday.html a cache \nwould deliver wrong document if it tried fetching it from content-location on \na wednesday.\n\nThis is the reasons a _formal_ cache can&#39;t use this information. But this \ndoesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not usable for web-centric applications but that it doesn&#39;t\nprovide information a cache can depend on. The requirements for the \ninformation a cache can depend on must be rather strict to avoid most of the\nerratical behaviour caches can introduce.\n\nActually the scoping of content-location is rather narrow. It&#39;s only valid \nwithin the request ( for the page requested ). But this suffices to make\nit very useful by removing the need for a lot of the redirects todays \nweb-applications is built around since it defines the base uri of the\nentity requested.\n\nI think it&#39;d be good if apache delivered it in as many cases as reasonable \nsince a lot of people tend to look at apache to see how a response &#39;should&#39; \nlook and if it would be used there it probably will become more widely \nadopted in both servers and browsers.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Mark Nottingham\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\nHaven&#39;t got a bugzilla account and need to sleep now :) \n\n\n/Mikael Andersson\n\n"}}
