Rather, the server must allow any\ninformation pertaining to a given steady state to be discoverable by the\nclient, i.e., no resource can be a dead end, and must reference its\ncontext by way of hypermedia.\n\nThe ability of a client to discover resource context via hypermedia is,\nafter all, what allows the client to be as stateful as it needs to be\nwhile the server remains stateless.\n\nK.\n\n-- \nKeith Gaughan - k@... - http://stereochro.me/ - CF9F6473\nAn idea that is not dangerous is unworthy\nof being called an idea at all.\n    -- Oscar Wilde\n\n"}}
