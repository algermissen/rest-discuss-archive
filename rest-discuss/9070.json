Among\n&gt; other things, it has to maintain a list of read messages which it\n&gt; does, as is common, with a newsrc file. A run list is maintained for\n&gt; each newsgroup.\n&gt;\n&gt; Resources are pretty obvious... user, newsgroup, article. We can do a\n&gt; PUT to the article(to which each user gets his &quot;own&quot; URL) modifying\n&gt; the flag that indicates whether it&#39;s been read, and the app can update\n&gt; the newsrc accordingly, and life is good.\n&gt;\n&gt; At least, as long as we want to mark just one article at a time. Dumb\n&gt; browser can&#39;t be told &quot;fire off five PUT requests to mark this group\n&gt; of five articles,&quot; and we sure as heck don&#39;t want the user to click\n&gt; five &quot;mark as read&quot; buttons, with dumb browser repainting the whole\n&gt; page in between. Even smart applications reeeeally don&#39;t want to send\n&gt; a thousand or so PUT requests when the user says &quot;catch up&quot; on a new\n&gt; newsgroup.\n&gt;\n&gt; So if we make the newsrc a resource, we can spoon-feed dumb browser a\n&gt; form at the bottom of the page we server, that includes the newsrc as\n&gt; it would look like with the five articles marked read, and if the user\n&gt; wants to mark them read, dumb browser can PUT the preconstructed form\n&gt; to the newsrc, and the server&#39;s RESTfully happy.\n&gt;\n&gt; So far, so good. But suppose Joe User&#39;s been paging through the\n&gt; articles. He&#39;s got a page with articles 1-5, a page with 6-10, a page\n&gt; with 11-15. And then he decides to mark them read. Dumb browser sends\n&gt; (PUTs, or at least POST-overloadeds) the page 3 newsrc run list:\n&gt; 11-15. Server&#39;s happy. Joe pages back to the second page, and marks\n&gt; those read. Dumb browser says &quot;PUT that newsrc to &#39;6-10&#39;&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, we don&#39;t want to serve Joe a 409 Conflict, and we don&#39;t want to\n&gt; unmark articles 11-15, and we don&#39;t want to make it impossible for a\n&gt; smarter application to say &quot;mark 6-10 read, unmark 11-15&quot; all at once\n&gt; on purpose. It&#39;s not too difficult to cater to dumb browser and put\n&gt; something in the form that determines whether to union, xor, diff, or\n&gt; intersect the PUT run list with the server&#39;s existing run list, but\n&gt; I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s an approach that eliminates the problem\n&gt; altogether.\nSomething like this was discussed a few weeks ago .  If I recall  \ncorrectly, the consensus was that PUT did not have to contain the  \nentire resource representation, but could just contain affected items.\n\nThus, if PUT contained an XML document (or equivalent thereof) that  \nlooks as follows:\n&lt;status&gt;\n\t&lt;item id=&quot;10&quot; mark=&quot;read&quot; /&gt;\n\t&lt;item id=&quot;11&quot; mark=&quot;read&quot; /&gt;\n\t&lt;item id=&quot;12&quot; mark=&quot;read&quot; /&gt;\n\t&lt;item id=&quot;13&quot; mark=&quot;read&quot; /&gt;\n\t&lt;item id=&quot;14&quot; mark=&quot;read&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/status&gt;\n\nThe server could apply the changes to only the supplied items.  That  \nis, item 1-9 and 15+ would remain unaffected.\n\n\n- Steve\n\n--------------\nSteve G. Bjorg\nhttp://www.mindtouch.com\nhttp://www.opengarden.org\n\n\n\n"}}
