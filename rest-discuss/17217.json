I&#39;d like to be lenient in my processing : if I find both invalid=\r\n data (i.e., not respecting the expected syntax) *and* some valid data, I w=\r\nant to process as much as possible of the valid data (because it is valuabl=\r\ne for my system), instead of rejecting the request upfront and not using th=\r\ne valid data. Still, it seems desirable to inform my client that his reques=\r\nt was partially malformed. \n\nNow, how would you do that in the context of H=\r\nTTP? Returning a 400 was my first thought. However, it means, per specifica=\r\ntion : &quot;The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed =\r\nsyntax. [...]&quot;, and I wonder if I&#39;m in that situation, given that the serve=\r\nr understood and acted on some part of the request. \nDo you know a better w=\r\nay of handling this? \n\nBonus question : As I realize this is more an HTTP q=\r\nuestion than a REST one, I&#39;d also be grateful for pointers to other places =\r\nwhere this kind of things can be discussed judiciously.\n\nPhilippe Mougin\nht=\r\ntp://pmougin.wordpress.com\n\n\n"}}
