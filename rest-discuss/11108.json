Other\n&gt; than the early blogging APIs being based on XML-RPC and eventually\n&gt; evolving into AtomPub I don&#39;t really know why forms with well-known\n&gt; query params aren&#39;t a a de-facto standard.\n\nBecause forms are expressed using HTML, and HTML deals with\npresentation and content, which is clearly different from what APIs\nare about.\n\n\nNow, before we discuss how well in holds, this wasn&#39;t a statement but\nan attempt to summarize in one line the gist of the reactions I got\nwhen suggesting that people just use forms.  There are obviously some\nlimitations to current specifications, HTML 4 not the most capable\nform language, but even for use cases which it does very well, that\nwas pretty much the knee jerk reaction I always received.\n\nI once illustrated how easily you can use forms to update a blog post\nby using curl instead of a Web browser.  The query parameters are\nactually common enough that the same code would work on different\nblogs, at least the two I tested with (WP and Blogger).  I got sent to\nlook at AtomPub and XML-RPC, because regardless of how many posts I\ncreated that way (around a thousand), forms are apparently unable to\nscale to the grueling demands presented by APIs.\n\nI think it&#39;s mostly -- again, speaking of cases where forms are\nsuccessfully used -- a matter of perception.\n\nAssaf\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Thoughts?\n&gt;\n&gt; Bill\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
