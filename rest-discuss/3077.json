Welcome to rest-discuss!\n\n(I&#39;m a newbie here, too (joined last week) so we can share\nexperiences... ;-)\n\nSo I suppose you actually just got tired of reading the list with\ninterleaved adverts on the website, huh?\n\nAnyway, I hope you jump in and put us all straight from time to time....\n\n\n &gt;My view is that chunking is a transfer issue; it&#39;s just a means of,\n &gt;well, chunking a stream into individual chunks.  But that said, it&#39;s a\n &gt;good idea for the server to send chunks that are optimally sized for\n &gt;incremental processing/rendering to reduce effective latency as seen by\n &gt;the client application.\n &gt;\nRight, that&#39;s how I read the HTTP RFC.\n\n\n &gt;This is what KnowNow does, as I understand it, where each chunk is an\n &gt;event notification.  I have no problem with it whatsoever, though from\n &gt;an XML POV, it&#39;s slightly flawed because the composite stream (what you\n &gt;get when you concatenate all the chunks) is not well-formed XML because\n &gt;there&#39;s no &quot;root container&quot;, like &lt;event-stream&gt; .. &lt;/event-stream&gt;.\n &gt;But I&#39;m ok with that.\n &gt;\nWell that&#39;s OK: just open the wrapping &lt;event-stream&gt; tag and forget to\nclose it!  And use a stream parser.\n\n\nAnyway - this gets to the core of the issue: that GET semantics are\ndifferent if you introduce the time-staking interpretation of chunks -\nthey cease to be just a transfer technology, and become timely events or\ndata updates.  It&#39;s the difference between:\n\n     &lt;Stuff&gt;\n         &lt;Big-Pile-Of-CDATA length=&quot;10000&quot;&gt;\n            :\n         &lt;/Big-Pile-Of-CDATA&gt;\n         &lt;!-- end of chunk one--&gt;\n            :\n         &lt;Big-Pile-Of-CDATA length=&quot;10000&quot;&gt;\n            :\n         &lt;/Big-Pile-Of-CDATA&gt;\n         &lt;!-- end of chunk two--&gt;\n     &lt;/Stuff&gt;\n     &lt;!--EOT--&gt;\n\n\nAnd:\n\n     &lt;event-stream&gt;\n         &lt;All-The-Data-In-One&gt;\n            :\n         &lt;/All-The-Data-In-One&gt;\n         &lt;!-- end of chunk one--&gt;\n             :\n         &lt;!-- tum tee tum, twiddle fingers --&gt;\n             :\n         &lt;Update&gt;\n            &lt;insert at-elem-number=&quot;12&quot;&gt;\n               &lt;new-piece att=&quot;val&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;/insert&gt;\n        &lt;/Update&gt;\n         &lt;!-- end of chunk two--&gt;\n            :\n            :\n     &lt;!-- still no close event-stream tag... --&gt;\n\n\nAs discussed before:\n\n     http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/600\n     http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/656\n\n\nSo if the latter, open-ended XML and the use of chunking\nin this way is OK, then *great* - we can dispose of\nMONITOR/HTTPEvents!!!  :-)\n\nDid the list reach a consensus back then?  It seems,\njudging by responses so far, that KnowNow and\nopen, dangling, time-chunk-semantics, &#39;subscriber&#39;\nGETs are OK.\n\nBut what about the cacheing issues? You need\nintermediaries to understand the difference between\n&#39;this is /all/ the data, in chunks&#39; and &#39;this /chunk/ is all\nthe data and subsequent chunks keep it up-to-date&#39;.\nWhich requires a little too much understanding of\nsome random update syntax by dumb proxies... Not that\nI object to intermediaries being replaced by first-class\npeers: at least they&#39;d be more use to us.\n\nRoy?!!! :-)\n\n\nDuncan Cragg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
