My point, which was obviously poorly stated, \nis\n&gt; that proof of breach can be demonstrated with a single message (the\n&gt; shipment notification, as I understand what one is).  Of course, \nproof\n&gt; of a entering into a contract should also be able to be demonstrated\n&gt; with a single message too.\n\nA. &quot;Proof&quot; is too strong a word; &quot;evidence&quot; is as good as you get.\nB. A contract is an agreement between at least two parties.\nEvidence of binding a contract using an electronic offer-acceptance \nprotocol might require at least two messages:  \none with the offer, signed by the offerer; \nanother with the acceptance, referring to the offer (with URI + \nhash), signed by the acceptor.\nIf the acceptance message contained the whole canonical \nrepresentation of the offer plus the hash plus the acceptance element \nplus the acceptor&#39;s digital signature, then maybe one message would \ndo. \nBut there are reasons not to do that:  for example, the timing of \nmessages, rules for contract formation, receipt acknowledgments, etc. \nmay also be important depending on how formal it&#39;s worth being.\n\nLikewise the evidence of performance of committed events is also \nstronger if both parties agree that the event was performed as \nnotified.  (Which again requires at least two messages.)\n\nFor example, it&#39;s much easier to send a shipment notification than to \nactually deliver the goods in good shape and time. The business \nprotocol needs to allow for receiving discrepancies.\n\nAll of the above are reasons why business deals are conversations \nwhere almost every statement refers to previous statements.  And \nrequires the previous statements for complete interpretation of its \nmeaning-in-context.\n\nIt&#39;s like there&#39;s at least two levels of meaning:  \n1. the content of the message - the values of its elements, and\n2. its residual effect on the business deal in which it is embedded.\n\nI have always taken the REST &quot;stateless&quot; rule in sense #1.\nIn other words, put all the element values plainly inline the message.\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
