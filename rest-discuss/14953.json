I don&#39;t understand why the distinction matte=\r\nrs.  I&#39;ve read here that it matters because the server could mix things up =\r\nand then the client in the hard coded situation would be stuck.  I&#39;d sugges=\r\nt that even in the &quot;REST&quot; scenario, a server could throw a curve ball that =\r\nwill leave the client with no place to go but home.  I think this classific=\r\nation has to more to do with degrees of coupling than it has to do with RES=\r\nT.\n\nWould an automated load tester (client) for a web application that uses=\r\n hypermedia to traverse the application and execution not be considered RES=\r\nTful because the state-machine for the application is hard-coded to some de=\r\ngree?\n\nI&#39;d like some clarity on this topic.\n\nThanks.\n\nEb\n\n\n"}}
