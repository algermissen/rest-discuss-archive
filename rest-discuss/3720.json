Of course it is easier to understand \nthe application if the information is all in the URI, but using other \nheaders does not break a REST constraint.\n\nVincent D Murphy wrote:\n&gt; On Tuesday, Jul 1, 2003, at 19:56 Europe/Dublin, Tyler Close wrote:\n&gt;  &gt; I am arguing against URIs like\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;http://www.acmebank.com/accounts/current/12/&gt;, where this URI\n&gt;  &gt; refers the 12th most recent payment made by a particular user.\n&gt; \n&gt; ah.  thanks for that clarification.\n&gt; \n&gt; i think your point (that such URIs are RESTless) can be more\n&gt; clearly made by stating that the only way that the &#39;current&#39;\n&gt; account alluded to in your URI can be dereferenced is by having\n&gt; access to some server-side state, or a session.\n&gt; \n&gt; this of course is RESTless all by itself because the server has\n&gt; to maintain that state using a gross hack (cf. cookies).\n&gt; \n&gt; YMMV.\n&gt; \n&gt; -v\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"}}
