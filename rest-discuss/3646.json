I think I have a vague sense of what it is,\n&gt; but I&#39;m not sure I understand why its important.  I took a look at\n&gt; Fielding&#39;s thesis, but I didn&#39;t see much at all on visibility.\n&gt;\n&gt; Can someone give me an example of why and how visibility is important\n&gt; (in REST).  I suspect that one of the examples will involve proxies, so\n&gt; if someone could give an additional example that&#39;d be even better.\n&gt;\nHmm. Good question. For me, visibility also implies standardization, which\nlets me program a server regardless of client - everybody uses the same auth\nheader & syntax & meaning. It&#39;s not just for intermediaries.\nVisibility for me is also the standardization of key aspects & generic\naspects of a message - resource identifier, method, authentication,\nrepresentation metadata (content-type...), etc. I&#39;m not all that interested\nin visibility for something like the phone number of someone purchasing a\nbook.\n\n"}}
