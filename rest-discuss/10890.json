Remember that there is no\nrequirement for resources to relate to objects in your server\napp, or to rows in a database, or anything like that; any bit of\nserver state that is interesting on its own can be considered a\nresource.\n\n&gt; Example: I want to deactivate a user in a user or employee\n&gt; management. With SOAP, RPC or something like that I create a\n&gt; method deactivate, an call it with the user number. How should\n&gt; I model this with REST over HTTP? Do I have to GET the full\n&gt; user data (JSON, XML, ...), change the state to &quot;deactivated&quot;\n&gt; and PUT this back? Or should I PUT to the users sub resource\n&gt; /users/1234/status/ the entity &quot;deactivated&quot;?\n\nYou can do it both ways. They are both appropriate, though one\nmore than the other depending on various circumstances.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
