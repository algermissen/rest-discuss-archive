I don&#39;t think there are any huge obstacles.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I just want the existing authentication system but without the UI.\n&gt;\n\nThe way Mozilla&#39;s system works is by routing based on scheme name. So\n&quot;Basic&quot; is always routed to the icky dialog implementation. You would\nprobably want to make up a scheme name, like &quot;BasicNoDialog&quot;, that is\notherwise identical.\n\nOf course, the existing schemes are not worth using, so you might as\nwell improve security and scalability and internationalization while\nyou&#39;re at it.
