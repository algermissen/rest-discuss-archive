Similar to files in a directory\n&gt;(though I emphatically don&#39;t think of the Web as a filesystem).\n&gt;\n\nWhile I agree with Justin, the counterargument is this:  A URI is by its \nnature singular, xyz is never a places and bob is never a people.  Expressing \nmetadata relationships in URIs is an interesting discussion, but I don&#39;t \nthink it&#39;s within the scope of REST.\n\nWhat I do think is within REST, is separating out the person names from the \nplace names by using hierarchical URIs.  In other words, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s \ncorrect to use:\n\n[1] http://example.org/bob\n[2] http://example.org/virginia\n\nIf /bob and /virginia are not equivalent resources, i.e. aren&#39;t the same \ntype, or as I prefer to say, not in the same set.  But the subdirectories, \nas far as I&#39;m concerned that REST is concerned, could be named /xyzzy/ and \n/yxzzx/.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
