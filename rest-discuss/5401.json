I want to automatically  \n&gt; build a thick-client GUI application that does the same thing, so I  \n&gt; can hook it into my desktop workflow using (on a Mac) Spotlight and  \n&gt; Automator.   I&#39;d also like to build a re-sharing web service using  \n&gt; Ruby on Rails, that consumes Amazon feeds and spits out a custom web  \n&gt; service according to certain rules.  Oh, and it&#39;d be nice to reformat  \n&gt; my personal page as an RSS feed. :-)\n\nThis is what I was trying to say.\n\n\nWith the WSDL/SOAP stack the things you&#39;re talking about are easy. Not\ntrivial, but easy.\n\nI&#39;ve worked on 3 or 4 projects now where REST has been kicked out\nbecause of this feature. I still think that&#39;s dumb and that REST with\nthis disadvantage is better than WSDL/SOAP... but if REST could have\nthis advantage as well then there&#39;d be no argument.\n\n\nI&#39;m not sure it&#39;s possible though...\n\n\nWith REST, most of what you&#39;re talking about would be possible now;\nexcept for the problem of description of the _type_ of\nrepresentations.\n\nI can HEAD to a resource to discover what HTTP interactions I can\nperform and what data representations I can send and get back. \n\nIf the site uses XForms, or something like that, I guess then I could\ndiscover quite a lot about further interactions I can perform...\n\nBut I think the equivalent of what you get with WSDL/SOAP would be if\na HEAD to a resource could tell you something like:\n\n   POST a FOAF document to this resource and it will respond with a \n   Calendar-RDF representation (of where the user&#39;s mentioned are\n   available)\n\nWe can&#39;t have that right now because the media types used for both\nrepresentations would be */xml.\n\nI&#39;m not sure how we can get round that because representations are by\ntheir very nature much less strictly specified than APIs (such as in\nSOAP).\n\nFor example, a FOAF document isn&#39;t really a FOAF document. It&#39;s just a\ndocument with a particular namespace associated with FOAF.\n\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
