Perhaps the\n&gt; browser could publish a Javascript hook so that pages could include a\n&gt; customized logout button, but the fallback could be a simple &quot;Log me\n&gt; out of this domain&quot; button in the browser toolbar.\n\nThis is not *really* a REST issue but more a user interface issue\nbecause in terms of RESTfull web services environments the HTTP 401 is\nreally all that is needed. There is no need to worry about entities.\n\n\n\nBut as far as the traditional webapp goes...\n\nI&#39;ve said here before that we need only 2 small changes to the web\narchitecture to enable solutions to the current webapp authentication\nissues :\n\n- browsers should *always* render any entity body recieved with a 401\n  response code (and only render the authenticate UI when there is no\n  entity body in a 401 response)\n\n- browsers should provide some hook for setting the Authorization\n  header on an outgoing request\n\nIf those two things were done then application developers would be\nable to respond to protected resource requests with a page that\nallowed application specific authentication. \n\nHere&#39;s a simple HTML page that might be sent in response to a request\nto a protected page:\n\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n&lt;form name=&quot;myform&quot; method=&quot;GET&quot; action=&quot;.&quot;&gt;\nusername : &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;usename&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;br/&gt;\npassword : &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;password&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;button name=&quot;login&quot; \n  onclick=&quot;\nset_auth_header(myform.username, myform.password); \nmyform.submit();\n&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\nThe onclick has been simplified, the set_auth_header() function is\nintended to illustrate the kind of hook that would be needed.\n\nNote that the authentication hook stuff is probably possible with\nmodern browsers which provide javascript tools for creating and\nmanipulating requests.\n\n\nThe existing requirements for 401&#39;s are:\n\n\n   The request requires user authentication. The response MUST include\n   a WWW-Authenticate header field (section 14.47) containing a\n   challenge applicable to the requested resource. The client MAY\n   repeat the request with a suitable Authorization header field\n   (section 14.8). If the request already included Authorization\n   credentials, then the 401 response indicates that authorization has\n   been refused for those credentials. If the 401 response contains\n   the same challenge as the prior response, and the user agent has\n   already attempted authentication at least once, then the user\n   SHOULD be presented the entity that was given in the response,\n   since that entity might include relevant diagnostic\n   information.\n\nSo it would be a bit of a change and maybe would need a new header to\nindicate this special case.\n\n\n\nNic\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk\n\n"}}
