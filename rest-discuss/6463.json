Actually, I hope that a future version of HTML will finally\n&gt; allow any HTTP method to be used in HTML forms.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the Restlet framework (http://www.restlet. org \n&gt; &lt;http://www.restlet.org&gt;), we consider the media\n&gt; type of the input representation to be orthogonal to the method\n&gt; requested, following the HTTP spec.\n&gt; \n&gt; And we do provide a method for parsing the input as a Form, and this\n&gt; method can be used with any method that can send content, including PUT:\n&gt; http://www.restlet. org/docs/ api/org/restlet/ Call.html# getInputAsForm \n&gt; &lt;http://www.restlet.org/docs/api/org/restlet/Call.html#getInputAsForm&gt;()\n\nHi,\n\nI realize I&#39;m late in this discussion, and I have to confess I didn&#39;t \nread all prior mails.\n\nI&#39;m really not sure what this discussion is about:\n\n1) application/x-www-form-urlencoded is a MIME type that can encode \nname/value pairs,\n\n2) It&#39;s used in HTML forms with POST,\n\n3) POST is defined in HTTP with very loose semantics, in particular the \napplication/x-www-form-urlencoded can be used to modify an existing \nresource, or to add a new subordinate based on these name/value pairs.\n\nNow PUT is different. When I do a PUT, I expect the server to modify the \nresource I target based on the *representation* I send. If that \nrepresentation happens to be of type application/x-www-form-urlencoded, \nso be it. In general, I would expect a server to just store the content, \nand do nothing more.\n\nOf course if the resource being authored happens to have a specific type \nthat can be represented as a set of name/value pairs (a property map), \nthe server could parse the body, extract the data and persist it in a \ndifferent way. But that&#39;s an edge case, not the general one. But doing \nthat although the nature of the resource is being something else (say, \nan MP3), would be a violate the semantics of PUT.\n\nThat is, a toolkit that blindly parses application/x-www-form-urlencoded \ncontent upon PUT IMHO has a severe bug. What it should do is allow the \ncode that implements PUT to have that content parsed *optionally*.\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
