The only concern is or backwards compatibilit=\r\ny.  Say I have a resource representation that is not following the conventi=\r\non because I didn&#39;t really understand the convention or didn&#39;t follow it th=\r\ne way it will be interpreted.  For example, take the media type discussed i=\r\nn the previous post  that you mention, text/form+html.  Hypothetically, if =\r\nI am producing that as a media type but really what I am sending is a snipp=\r\net that is not a valid HTML document, is there any reason to fear that anyt=\r\nhing would stop working if proxies started interpreting that media type to =\r\nexpect valid HTML? &lt;&lt;\n&gt;\n&gt; This situation would be the same as not adhering =\r\nto any other media type, i think. In fact your snippet would not even be a =\r\nvalid representation of the &quot;derived&quot; media type.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think, the only con=\r\ntraint would be, that e.g. a VALID &quot;application/atom+xml&quot; representation is=\r\n still a valid &quot;application/xml&quot; representation. As far as i know, this is =\r\nanyway state of the art. it is just not standardized (except for XML Media =\r\ntypes [1]).\n&gt;\n&gt; The backward compatibilty is also given for intermediaries:=\r\n if they do know the derivation concept, the visibility increases. if they =\r\ndo not know the correlation, they would handle such a media type as an unkn=\r\nown media type. like an intermediary today, who knows xml but not atom, wou=\r\nld ignore atom documents.\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3023.txt\n&gt;\n&gt; -=\r\n-- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jakob Strauch&quot; &lt;jakob.strauch@&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Due to previous posts [1] i was asking myself, if it would make se=\r\nnse to standarize the usage of the + sign in media type indications.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; I think the benfit would be, that a more specific media type like  &quot;appli=\r\ncation/odata+atom+xml&quot; (which is currently not existing) could be at least =\r\ninterpret as &quot;application/atom+xml&quot; (which is currently the media type of a=\r\nn odata resource [2]).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; An intermediary could look at the media type=\r\n &quot;application/odata+atom+xml&quot; and could interpret it as a known atom repres=\r\nentation, even if he don=B4t know the odata media type. If atom is also unk=\r\nnown, maybe he is interessted, that it=B4s a valid xml document, too.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; This seems to be just an convention at the moment or standarized only fo=\r\nr xml-based documents [3]. Furthermore, it would imho calm down the debate =\r\nabout generic vs specific media type.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What do you think?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [1=\r\n] http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/17665\n&gt; &gt; [2] htt=\r\np://www.odata.org/developers/protocols/atom-format\n&gt; &gt; [3] http://www.ietf.=\r\norg/rfc/rfc3023.txt\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nYahoo!
