Seems like this is a security by\n&gt; obscurity a=\r\npproach? I would not ordinarily be able to guess the embedded url\n&gt; https:/=\r\n/yurl.net/id/puqjiq25fjqre67paoc7omi3iynbdw62 , but your form\n&gt; delivers it=\r\n to me, so therefore I have access to it and its descendants.\n\nYou correctl=\r\ny understand the mechanism, but label it incorrectly with\n&quot;security by obsc=\r\nurity&quot;.\n\nThe embedded URL\n&lt;https://yurl.net/id/puqjiq25fjqre67paoc7omi3iynb=\r\ndw62&gt; is unguessable.\nThe only way for you to come into possession of this =\r\nURL is through\nsomeone else who knows it voluntarily giving it to you. In t=\r\nhis case,\nI voluntarily gave you the URL\n&lt;https://yurl.net/id/6fo4lr6it4top=\r\nf5rqcnml2fpav2hzmug&gt;, which in turn\nvoluntarily gave you the URL\n&lt;https://y=\r\nurl.net/id/puqjiq25fjqre67paoc7omi3iynbdw62&gt;. Without my\nexplicit, voluntar=\r\ny action, you would be unable to access the\nidentified resource.\n\n&quot;Security=\r\n through obscurity&quot; refers to mechanisms whose security\nrelies on the secre=\r\ncy of a guessable secret. These mechanisms rely on\nlack of popularity, or o=\r\nbscurity, reducing the chances of someone\nbothering to make some good guess=\r\nes. Such mechanisms fail when a good\nguesser takes an interest in them, thu=\r\ns ending their obscurity and\nsecurity.\n\nThe random number included in a cap=\r\nability URL is long enough to be\nunguessable. It doesn&#39;t matter how much at=\r\ntention is directed at\nguessing such a URL, the mechanism remains secure. T=\r\nhis approach to\ncreating security is similar to that used in SSL. The symme=\r\ntric\nsession encryption key is also just a long random number. The security=\r\n\nof the SSL session depends on this long random number being\nunguessable.\n\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;list&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;doc schema=3D&quot;http://waterken.org/name/AuthorProxyScope$Aut=\r\nhor-interface&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;super schema=3D&quot;http://yurl.org/Author&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;self sch=\r\nema=3D&quot;http://web-calculus.org/pointer/Embed&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;target&gt;6fo4lr6it4topf5r=\r\nqcnml2fpav2hzmug&lt;/target&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;/self&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;topic&gt;home comments&lt;/topic&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;value schema=3D&quot;http://web-calculus.org/pointer/Link&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;target&gt;scdexb3=\r\nncrpdfp7lvd4guthvt6floqny&lt;/target&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;/value&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;assign schema=3D&quot;http:=\r\n//web-calculus.org/pointer/Link&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;target&gt;puqjiq25fjqre67paoc7omi3iynbd=\r\nw62&lt;/target&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;/assign&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;revoke schema=3D&quot;http://web-calculus.org/po=\r\ninter/Link&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;target&gt;mzkuol4e6u4konlco4tfxgyajqg5ewhd&lt;/target&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;/re=\r\nvoke&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;proxy schema=3D&quot;http://web-calculus.org/pointer/Link&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;targ=\r\net&gt;z7b4euktmhbxbfax5nvvt7wsnclnjvhj&lt;/target&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;/proxy&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;/super&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;/doc&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;/list&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [hvw] The point being I had to discover the nest=\r\ned url\n&gt; https://yurl.net/id/puqjiq25fjqre67paoc7omi3iynbdw62.\n\nExactly.\n\n&gt;=\r\n Nothing prevents me\n&gt; from posting that URL on some web page, or sending i=\r\nt in an email to my\n&gt; friends, right?\n\nCorrect, as you&#39;ve just demonstrated=\r\n.\n\n&gt; So once you have shown me an URL, anyone I choose to send it\n&gt; to has =\r\naccess too?\n\nCorrect, anyone *you* *choose* to send it to has access too. T=\r\nhis is a\ngood thing. You may have legitimate reasons for sharing your acces=\r\ns\nand the access control mechanism should support this. Delegating work\nto =\r\nothers is often a crucial part of getting your job done.\n\nFurthermore, it i=\r\ns impossible to prevent such delegation by you. Once\nyou have access to a r=\r\nesource, you could just as well setup a proxy\nresource which accepts reques=\r\nts from your friends and forwards their\nrequests to the original resource. =\r\nGiven that I cannot prevent you\nfrom setting up such a proxy service, I don=\r\n&#39;t gain any access control\nguarantees by preventing you from sharing direct=\r\n access to the\noriginal resource.\n\nThanks for the questions,\n\nTyler\n\n--\nThe=\r\n web-calculus is the union of REST and capability-based security:\nhttp://ww=\r\nw.waterken.com/dev/Web/\n\nName your trusted sites to distinguish them from p=\r\nhishing sites.\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=3D957\n=\r\n\n"}}
