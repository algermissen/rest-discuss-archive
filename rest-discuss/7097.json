PUT is &#39;set state to&#39;\n&gt;\n&gt; fuzzyBSc (Benjamin S Carlyle?) does not agree with you here: &quot;PUT  \n&gt; can even implicitly create new resources, either by storing to a  \n&gt; url that returned &quot;404 Not Found&quot; before the request and now  \n&gt; returns &quot;200 OK&quot; (http://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl? \n&gt; MinimumMethods)\nPUTting to a resource that formerly returned 404 is not creating that  \nresource! 404 does not mean the resource is not there, just that  \nthere are no representations (currently). When you PUT, there is no  \nHTTP licensed expectation that a resource be created!\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; As an example, let&#39;s say I want to create a configuration interface  \n&gt; for a servlet container.\n&gt; On the one hand, I want to PUT to /container, and just change the  \n&gt; port, leaving all servlets intact.\n&gt;\n&gt; PUT /container\n&gt; &lt;container port=&quot;8000&quot; threads=&quot;50&quot;/&gt;\nfine (if there are really no other properties of the container\n&gt;\n&gt; On the other hand I would like to enable people to init the  \n&gt; container with exactly one PUT: the whole shebang including all  \n&gt; servlets:\n&gt;\n&gt; PUT /container\n&gt; &lt;container port=&quot;8000&quot; threads=&quot;50&quot;&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;servlet class=&quot;my.Servlet&quot; uri=&quot;/servlet1/*&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;servlet class=&quot;my.other.Servlet&quot; uri=&quot;/servlet2/*&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/container&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; How do I know in the first case that I don&#39;t want to delete all  \n&gt; servlets?\nYou can&#39;t. The payload of PUT is exactly the state you want the  \nresource to be in after the PUT. You cannot provide a delta. But you\ncan simply make up resources for the individual properties and PUT to  \nthose (e.g. to change the port PUT some appropriate representation\nof 8000 to /container/port\n\n\n&gt; Likewise with GET. I would like people to GET the whole thing at  \n&gt; once and PUT it\n&gt; somewhere else instead of 3 operations.\n\nSo thenm GET the whole thing and PUT it afterwards.\n&gt;\n&gt; In terms of Atom, if a server allowed a PUT to a collection URI,  \n&gt; how to determine whether\n&gt; to change the list of entries !?\n\nAtom has no notion of collections implementing PUT. In terms of HTTP,  \nPUTting to a collection\nwould mean to set the collection to exactly the state represented by  \nthe PUT payload.\n\nPUT is defined in a certain way by HTTP and the semantics do not  \nprovide for delta updates in\nany way.\n\n(The server need not blindly take and &#39;store&#39; the recevied state, it  \ncan change it. But PUT does not\nprovide for any partial update-like expectations by the client)\n\nHTH,\nJan\n&gt;\n&gt; Matthias\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
