FTP is not an\nexample of client-cache-stateless-server and has no late binding of\nrepresentation to resource.  None of which matters when using FTP PUT,\nwhich I do use on occasion, but it makes all the difference in the\nworld on GET -- where no protocol other than HTTP makes any shred of\nsense to use in REST, in this day and age.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
