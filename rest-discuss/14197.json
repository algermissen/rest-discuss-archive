You\n&gt; say this based on AtomPub saying that collections are represented as Atom\n&gt; feed documents. Otherwise, there would simply be no expectation of receiving\n&gt; Atom feeds as a response to a GET to the collection.\n\nNo, I was addressing the evolutionary capability of the service.\n\nThe former service is &quot;kind&quot; because it honors it&#39;s existing contracts\nwith older clients that aren&#39;t up to speed with the service change\nover from atom+xml to neutrino+xml. The premise being that the actual\nservice being performed and made available with the neutrino+xml is\nsimilar enough to an atom+xml, that the atom+xml version was still\nworth supporting.\n\nSupporting both lets service evolve towards new functionality while\nleaving a working network system behind by supporting the now old,\ndeprecated types.\n\nA nice feature is that the client can tell the service what it is\ngetting (via Content-type), while at the same time telling the server\nwhat it can expect back (via Accept). This con neg ability lets you\nbuild both robust clients and servers.\n\nWhile both are implementing strict interpretations of the content\ntypes, the ability to support multiple types for similar domains,\nnotably evolving domains, along with being able to send along where\nyou stand in the evolution of the service (i.e. are you running atom\nor neutrino) gives, I think, and overall more robust system,\nespecially when communicating with multiple peers which are at\ndifferent levels of implementation.\n\nIf the server, in this case, simply shuts down the atom support in\nfavor of neutrino support, then it just unceremoniously cut out a lot\nof existing clients.\n\nObviously any external communication regarding the service change\nisn&#39;t part of this discussion. All sorts of valid reasons for a hard\ncut off.\n\nBut, IMHO, combining the negotiation aspect with &quot;upwardly&quot; (at least\nat a meta level) compatible formats adds robustness to the system, and\nmake changes less disruptive.\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n(willh@...)\n\n"}}
