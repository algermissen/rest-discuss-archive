I agree  \nwith what seems to be the majority here that the &quot;froth&quot; of multiple  \ncompeting implementations is good in that it encourages innovation  \nand enables multiple tools focused on different needs, but it can  \nalso confuse the marketplace. For example, Python has a bunch of web  \nframeworks that compete. Ruby, by contrast, has Rails, which  \ndominates so much that you don&#39;t hear about any other Ruby web  \nframework. I think that actually helps promote Ruby over Python to  \nsome extent. So even though froth is good in general, there is a  \ntradeoff.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nPresident\nArtima, Inc.\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n\n\n"}}
