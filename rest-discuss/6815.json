As regards \n&gt;&gt; proper REST architectural style I think it&#39;s a \n&gt;&gt; non-issue because architecturally, both are \n&gt;&gt; correct and that&#39;s all that matters. \n\nI respect that.  \n\nOTOH, I think maybe what I&#39;m looking for is to find a layer of constraints\nthat can be placed on top of REST. \n\nAlthough I really hate quoting 37 Signals as I think they&#39;ve been overhyped,\nI do think they have a point about embracing constraints:\nhttp://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch03_Embrace_Constraints.php  I think\nproviding some some guidance on constraints would make it easier and quicker\nto implement REST systems and minimize the time required to come up to speed\non REST. Constraints such as:\n\n* Eliminate the need to make arbitrary decisions,\n* Recognize patterns that are beneficial in a large percentage of cases, and\n* Offer Best Practices, and reference implementations.\n\nNow I don&#39;t mean IN ANY WAY TO CONSTRAIN _REST_ IN GENERAL, just to provide\na conceptual layer on top of REST like AJAX was a conceptual layer on top of\nJavaScript, XML, and the HTML DOM. (I call that my &quot;lots of little layers&quot;\nprinciple:\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blog/MonolithicComplexityVsLotsOfLittleLayers.as\npx)\n\nSo I was trying to find a good reason to choose singular vs. plural.\n\nAnd didn&#39;t mean any slight to you when I guess I implied yours wasn&#39;t\n&quot;well-considered guidance&quot; but instead am looking for well-considered\nguidance that does recommend one over the other.\n\n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n\nP.S. Regarding a constraint model on REST, maybe *that* could transcend\n&quot;just an architecture style&quot; and move into being a recommendation.\n\n\n"}}
