(My personal view of a 21st\n&gt; century intelligent agent - agent in the AI sense - is that of a\n&gt; relatively stupid little unit composed of a HTTP client, (access from)\n&gt; a HTTP server a little bit of code/wiring to express its business\n&gt; rules).\n&gt;\n&gt; My reservation on the ACL front would be that currently a great deal\n&gt; of per-source manual configuration would be required to set something\n&gt; like this up (and modify it as requirements and sources evolve).\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ps: not many people do this currently, but you can, virtuoso for example\n&gt;&gt; enables this, and there are js implementations in the works to encourage\n&gt;&gt; this pattern. (full read write ACL controlled web of linked data is still at\n&gt;&gt; proto stage)\n&gt;\n&gt; Right. I wasn&#39;t aware of how far Virtuoso had got on this, but it&#39;s\n&gt; good to hear that work is in progress.\n\n"}}
