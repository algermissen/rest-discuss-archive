The different versions ARE representation variants of the same resource and giving them their own URLs allows clients with content negotation impediments (CNIs?) the ability to cope. What&#39;s wrong with that?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; You&#39;ll end up in Link maintenance hell.\n&gt; \n&gt; Because these aren&#39;t permalinks. I agree. But it seems like a painful choice to force clients to support content negotiation on my custom media types.\n\nWell, if your client says\n\nGET /foo HTTP/1.1\n\nit better be speaking HTTP 1.1, eh?\n\nJan\n\n&gt; \n&gt; What do you think if I try to split the baby and offer a permalink at http://example.com/mything that allows content negotiation if the client supports it and redirects to the variant that matches the requested media type, such as http://example.com/v2/mything . If they can&#39;t do content negotiation, or submit an invalid choice we can redirect them to a document that enumerates all the versions.\n&gt; \n&gt; This actually gives me a URN (the permalink) to use to refer to the entity itself (the car, not the document about the car as TBL says). Representations that want to refer to my car should use its permalink URN.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
