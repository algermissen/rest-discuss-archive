Alexander Jacobson&quot; &lt;alex@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Perhaps we can define a convention here about the\n&gt; headers and body of an OPTIONS response so as to\n&gt; make interoperability easy.\n&gt;\n&gt; Here is the information it would be nice for the\n&gt; server to be able to send:\n&gt; * Allow: methods\n&gt; * Content-Types: available via content-negotiation\n&gt; * Accept-POST: content types\n&gt; * Accept-PUT: content types\n&gt; * Accept-PUT-Charset:\n&gt; * Accept-POST-Charset:\n&gt; * Accept-PUT-Encoding:\n&gt; * Accept-POST-Encoding:\n&gt; * Accept-PUT-Language:\n&gt; * Accept-POST-Language:\n&gt; * WWW-GET-Authenticate:\n&gt; * WWW-POST-Authenticate:\n&gt; * WWW-PUT-Authenticate:\n\nI suggest a slightly different format:\n\nverb request-header:value\n\nwhere:\n\nverb: GET, PUT, POST, etc., and &quot;*&quot; which means any verb (for which the\nfollowing request-header is allowed)\nrequest-header: these are headers that it recognizes (e.g. content-type,\nuser-agent, etc.)\nvalue: indicates an allowable value (following the same rules for the actual\nrequest-header).\n\nAny combination that is not explicitly defined means that the resource\ndoesn&#39;t care about those headers.\n\nSo, suppose you encountered a response like:\n\nPUT content-type:text/html\n* content-type: application/xml+rss\nGET user-agent:Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)\n\n\nIn this case, this is saying that PUT only allows a content-type of\ntext/html or application/xml+rss, while all other verbs (in this case POST)\nallow only application/xml+rss.  Also, the resource is only GETable by IE6\n(or a client that says it&#39;s IE6).  Note that no other combination is defined\nfor user-agent, so it implies that any client can issue a POST, PUT, etc.\n\nIt might even do to extend this format slightly to allow the server to\nexplicitly indicate that it understands a given header name, thereby\nallowing new clients to query a server to see if the server can handle the\nadded features of the client.  I&#39;m not sure how this format would be.  Maybe\njust leave the value out of the above string.  Are there any existing\nheaders where an empty string is a valid value?  If so, we could possibly\nleave the colon off.  For instance, suppose there was a new request header\ncalled &quot;my-feature&quot;.  The server could return:\n\n* my-feature:  (or without the colon)\n\nto indicate that it knows about this field and handles it according to\nwhatever semantics it has.\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
