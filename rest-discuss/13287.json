Choosing to \nhave JBoss lead and own such an effort in a JCP-style way doesn&#39;t \ninspire me good things either.\n\nIn addition, the &quot;REST-*&quot; naming is so uninspiring that it must have \nbeen suggested by a REST opponent! It reminds me of the attempt to \ndescribe the JAX-RS API as the &quot;REST API for Java&quot;...\n\nREST defines architecture principles, not protocols, not media types and \ndoesn&#39;t even mandate the use of HTTP. The term &quot;REST API&quot; is already \nambiguous but widely used as a shortcut for &quot;RESTful [HTTP] API&quot;. Please \ndon&#39;t add confusion.\n\nIn addition, I think that the idea of &quot;standardizing&quot; such RESTful HTTP \nAPIs at this stage is just wrong and will lead to results similar to \n&quot;WS-*&quot; due to politics and market timing issues.\n\nIt doesn&#39;t mean that proposing RESTful APIs for such problems isn&#39;t \nuseful or necessary. As you know, there are already existing efforts in \nthose areas and having more attempts at this stage sounds useful. For \nexample, Google recently announced its PubSubHubbub effort:\nhttp://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/\n\nThen, let the most popular media types (such as Atom) or RESTful APIs \n(such as Amazon S3) win and be leveraged by developers and supported by \ntools. Just don&#39;t lead people into thinking that there is or even need \nto be a consensus in the REST community on how to define such RESTful \nAPIs, especially when you haven&#39;t even consulted it with your plans.\n\nMy suggestion is that Roy quickly starts and leads an official REST \nproject, maybe at the W3C or at IETF where important things engaging the \nREST community could be organized and decided. I&#39;m afraid otherwise that \nsuch a wonderful adventure will get side-tracked or harmed.\n\nBest regards,\nJerome Louvel\n--\nRestlet ~ Founder and Lead developer ~ http://www.restlet.org\nNoelios Technologies ~ Co-founder ~ http://www.noelios.com\n\n\nRoy T.

Message queues are a common integration\n&gt; technique for non-REST architectures. To claim that either one\n&gt; is a component of &quot;Pragmatic REST&quot; is the equivalent of putting\n&gt; a giant Red Dunce Hat on your head and then parading around as\n&gt; if it were the latest fashion statement.\n&gt; \n&gt; The idea that the community would welcome such a pack of\n&gt; marketing morons as the standards-bearers of REST is simply\n&gt; ridiculous. Just close the stupid site down.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sincerely,\n&gt; \n&gt; Roy T.
