It has been suggested that admins won&#39;t\ncache unfamiliar data types.\n\nBut what are some other examples? I heard a mention of link caching,\nor some such thing. What is that referring to? Is that premised on a\nproxy perhaps prefetching links in an HTML payload much like some\nbrowsers do today? Something of that nature?\n\nAre search engine search bots an example?\n\nMy other question refers to the use of bundling domain specific\ninformation in a generic media type.\n\nFor example, a campaign donation. In theory, in the US, candidates\nneed to make their campaign donations accessible to the public.\n\nIt&#39;s not a leap to suggest a campaign website publishing a service\nthat returns an Atom list of donations based on some query.\n\nFor example, GET /donations?query=county:Los%20Angeles to see all\ndonations for Los Angeles county.\n\nAnd the result can have links to the actual donation documents.\n\nOn the one hand, these donation documents could be\napplication/x-campaign-donation+xml, with a specification posted on\nthe campaign website. But that&#39;s an unregistered media type.\n\n&lt;donation&gt;\n    &lt;name&gt;Bob Eubanks&lt;/name&gt;\n    &lt;date&gt;09/01/2010&lt;/date&gt;\n    &lt;amount&gt;25.00&lt;/amount&gt;\n&lt;/donation&gt;\n\nOn the other hand, it could be simply text/html:\n\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n&lt;dl&gt;\n    &lt;dt&gt;Name&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Bob Eubanks&lt;/dd&gt;\n    &lt;dt&gt;Date&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;09/01/2010&lt;/dd&gt;\n    &lt;dt&gt;Amount&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;$25.00&lt;/dd&gt;\n&lt;/dt&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nHere&#39;s my issue.\n\nThe application/x-campaign-donation+xml is not self descriptive, since\nit is unregistered. Therefore it has no expectation of getting any\nreuse. It may well not even be cached, even with appropriate caching\nheaders.\n\nThe HTML version is self descriptive, but it&#39;s only self descriptive\nof HTML. It&#39;s not self descriptive of a campaign donation. There is no\nway to identify this resource as a campaign donation. It can benefit\nfrom some reuse, notably caching, potentially google, etc. But there\ncan be no expectation of reuse at the domain level. For example, if\nsomeone wanted to track the rate of donations by county, they can not\ndo that on the HTML payload, as they have no documentation of the\ndomain elements within the payload. This has no semantics outside of\nHTML, because that&#39;s all it is identified with.\n\nMuch like the difference between application/xml and\napplication/x-campaign-donation+xml. Both are XML, but one has the\ncampaign donation semantics associated with it.\n\nThat&#39;s my conflict with all this. That using generic containers, you\nmay only be able to get domain knowledge through introspection, yet\nintrospection is considered a bad practice, that&#39;s one reason cited\nwhy application/xml is not a proper media type to use.\n\nI was hoping this conundrum could be discussed to learn how in\npractice this conflict can be overcome.\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n(willh@...)\n\n"}}
