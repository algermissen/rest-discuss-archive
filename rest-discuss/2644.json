Does this change based\non\n&gt; &gt; the response code being used?  Are some headers considered part of the\n&gt; &gt; representation while others are not?\n&gt;\n&gt; I believe a client agent needs to understand all of them to understand\nwhat\n&gt; is and is not the representation.\n&gt; For example, the Content-Type header is metadata /about/ the\nrepresentation.\n&gt; A status code tells you if the entity is even a representation or not. And\n&gt; so on.\n\nThis is also my current understanding, so I don&#39;t disagree with what you are\nsaying.  However, this view seems almost useless when talking about REST (at\nleast to me).  It seems to me that part of what makes REST effective is\nthat, given a particular RESTful system, we can all agree on what does and\ndoes not constitute the representation of a resource (either sent or\nreceived, for that matter).  However, with HTTP this is not very clear to\nme.  I would think that the Message-body is always part of the\nrepresentation (when there is one).  But the headers seems to be less\nwell-defined.  For instance, would the &quot;Location&quot; header in a 201 response\nbe considered part of the representation?  As you suggest, Content-Type\nwould be about the respresentation.  Does that mean that it is not part of\nthe representation?\n\nOne thing that has suddenly occured to me is that I may be following a false\nassumption here as well.  I assumed that in RESTful applications,\nrepresentations were *always* sent (in responses).  However, the more I\nthink about this, the more this doesn&#39;t make sense.  If I can send a request\nthat contains no representation (e.g. GET), then I should be able to receive\na response that has no presentation (201 maybe?).  This doesn&#39;t necessarily\nhelp me understand what is part of a representation when one is sent, but\nthis changed view would at least allow me to avoid wondering about several\nHTTP response codes for which there does not appear to be a representation.\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
