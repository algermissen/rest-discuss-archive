[rest-\ndiscuss] wrote:\n\n&gt; i guess i am having trouble with looking at a connection as a resource\n&gt; with state (unless you talk about network monitoring and management\n&gt; scenarios, which are an entirely different beast).\n\nNo, a connection isn&#39;t a resource. But keeping a connection open from \neach client to the server puts a strain on the server. Ideally, a \nRESTful service is loaded only &quot;dynamically&quot; in the sense that the \n(&quot;static&quot;) number of clients is irrelevant, what counts is the \n(&quot;dynamic&quot;) number of requests per unit of time. My understanding of \nREST is that this is deliberate and very helpful for scalability. Open \nconnections are a strain on a service even in the absence of any \nrequests. For one thing, a single server can only manage a limited \nnumber of open connections at a time.\n\nIn REST, at least as far as I understand it(!), state is only supposed \nto figure as transferred resource state; session state is prohibited.\n\nMy understanding may be wrong and I&#39;m perfectly willing to tone down the \nRESTful ideal for practical purposes. The point I&#39;m trying to make is \npurely a matter of classification, ie that I think persistent \nconnections are not RESTful.\n\n\n&gt; but it is entirely possible to envisage that HTTP pull is like UPS\n&gt; ground and free, whereas there may be UPS overnight which costs a bit\n&gt; but is faster. if you do that, you get to specify your identifier, and\n&gt; then (and this is why i call this &quot;reverse REST&quot;) you become the\n&gt; resource to be pushed to, i.e. your resource needs to be known by the\n&gt; event source. there are tons of PubSub approaches out there, only\n&gt; that coming up with one that works robustly and in a scalable at web\n&gt; scale so far hasn&#39;t worked. the main reason is that for pull, sources\n&gt; don&#39;t need to know the consumers, whereas for push that state needs\n&gt; to be maintained, which is expensive.\n\nSo, is &quot;reverse REST&quot; still RESTful? Yes, the individual push request \nfrom server to client probably qualifies. The architecture as a whole \nprobably doesn&#39;t. As you write, state needs to be maintained which \nhinders scalability.\n\nA truly RESTful solution would have to do without such state. *I* don&#39;t \nsee how that is possible, but that&#39;s why I started this discussion.\n\nAlso, I&#39;d like to repeat that I don&#39;t mean not being RESTful, or not \nbeing reactive, as some kind of condemnation. Both approaches offer very \nsensible advice in general, I&#39;m interested in seeing how well they fit \ntogether.\n\n[...]\n&gt; &gt;&gt; a push model. there are a variety of push protocols (PuSH, MQTT,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; APN,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; C2DM, sMAP) out there, but none so far has taken over the world.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know anything about these models/protocols. Do they work in\n&gt; &gt; practice at this time? In particular, if the client is a single-page\n&gt; &gt; application running in a browser?\n&gt; \n&gt; these are two very different questions. they work very well in\n&gt; practice, for example across all iOS devices (APN), across all\n&gt; android devices (C2DM), in building automation scenarios (sMAP), or\n&gt; in large sensor network settings (MQTT). \n\nOK, I take these as existence proofs that push works in practice.\n\n&gt; they all come with different\n&gt; design goals and constraints, and it seems that you have something\n&gt; specific in mind as well. as long as you don&#39;t better understand the\n&gt; specific constraints of the scenario you have in mind, picking a\n&gt; solution (or writing down the requirements for a new one) probably\n&gt; will be hard.\n\nRight now I&#39;m not trying to do anything, I&#39;m first and foremost trying \nto understand the landscape. As a consequence, my specific questions \nkeep changing. My starting point was the question &quot;What would a \n&#39;reactive&#39; and RESTful web application look like from browser through \napp server to database&quot;. Especially when it comes to the communication \nbetween browser (or rather JavaScript-client) and app server, I don&#39;t \nsee how to reconcile statelessness and event-drivenness.\n\nMichael\n\n-- \nMichael Schuerig\nmailto:michael@...\nhttp://www.schuerig.de/michael/\n\n\n"}}
