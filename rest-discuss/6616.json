Fact is, most (all?) existing web browsers\n&gt; implement only about half of what&#39;s necessary for a full REST\n&gt; implementation: GET and POST but not PUT and DELETE. HTML forms and\n&gt; XForms 1.0 don&#39;t even allow PUT and DELETE as actions. :-(\n\nIt would have been nice if the W3C had used its influence in the\nbrowser space to define standards for browser UI.  Things like\nsession logout, usable login dialogs, and the lack of standard\naffordances for PUT, DELETE, etc., are all left undone because\n&quot;that&#39;s how Mosaic did it&quot; was the only standard that mattered.\n\nI thought that WHATWG was going to pick up the slack on some of\nthose undefined standards-in-waiting, but apparently not.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
