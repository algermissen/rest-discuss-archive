In concrete terms, &quot;when you GET a representation of a resource,\n&gt; should that representation include a description of the operations\n&gt; the resource supports?&quot;\n\nThat&#39;s not what I am asking.  Rephrased:\n\nIs the *ability* to perform a GET against a resource part of that resource?\nIs the response itself (not just the body) part of that resource?\n\nor\n\nCan a resource be accessible through HTTP and still not have any aspect of\nHTTP be part of itself?\n\nIn concrete terms, suppose there is a text file (content-type: text/plain).\nIt exists, but is not accessible (limited to the discussion of HTTP).  It is\nresource R.  Now, we make that text file available via HTTP at URI_A.  I can\nissue a GET on URI and get back a representation of that text file.  Is it\nstill resource R or is it now resource R&#39;, where the ability to perform a\nGET on it and to get back a representation (plus HTTP headers, etc) are also\npart of the resource?\n\n&gt; Isn&#39;t that closer to the real issue?\n\nNot exactly, though that conversation did spark my question.\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
