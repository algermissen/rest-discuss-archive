I&#39;m designing a URL scheme for resources in a \nREST based architecture.\n\nHowever, these resources can have different identifiers.  They have a \nphysical ID that is unique, a logical id which can identify bunch of versions \nof a resource, and other id&#39;s like name.\n\nTypically, you see RESTian urls of the form:\n\n\thttp://mydomain.com/resource/id\n\nwhich works well for the physical id situation.\n\nBut what if I want to get the resource with alternate id&#39;s?  Let&#39;s use the \nlogical id as an example.  Would this be reasonable:\n\n\thttp://mydomain.com/resource/(LID)lid/version\n\nwhere lid is the logical id and LID is just an identifier, and version is an \noptional version specifier (latest version returned if missing)?\n\nOr is having two URL&#39;s identify the same resource a no-no, which would make \nsense to me?  In which case, that would prompt me to look towards a more \nquery oriented structure such as\n\n\thttp://mydomain.com/resource?idType=LID&lid=mylid&version=1.1\n\nJust wondering what the consensus might be on this.\n\nI&#39;m leaning towards a single unique URL for each resource, based on id, with \nalternate references using the query syntax.\n\n\n\n\nAndrzej Jan Taramina\nChaeron Corporation: Enterprise System Solutions\nhttp://www.chaeron.com\n\n\n"}}
