You do not get any other methods as the uniform set (the HTTP methods in the case of using HTTP as an architecture)\n&gt; \n&gt; Without any intention to be rude, I suggest you take a while to read through some of the REST material out on the Web (the REST wiki at http://rest.blueoxen.net is a good starting point as is Paul&#39;s site at http://prescod.com/rest ). This will help in future discussions.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Should I use &#39;POST&#39; with a &#39;method=build&#39; parameter to the &#39;plan&#39; URI?\n&gt; \n&gt; No, this is about the worst from a REST POV as it is hidden RPC.\n&gt; \n&gt; Think along these lines:\n&gt; \n&gt; Provide a means for clients to pick a resource that behaves the way they are interested in (some hypermedia the clients come accross could declare a resource as a BuildingManager) and then use POST to submit the building plan.\n&gt; \n&gt; POST /BuildingManager\n&gt; Content-Type: application/blueprint          &lt;-- this type is fictous; it would need to be standardized within the realm of your system\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;blueprint&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;wall location=&quot;....&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/blueprint&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; IOW, in a RESTful system clients late-bind to resources based on runtime-declared abstract bahavior of those resources and they communicate via a fixed set of methods.\n&gt; \n&gt; HTH,\n&gt; \n&gt; Jan \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;&gt; Ittay\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
