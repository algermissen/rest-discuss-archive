I would put it differently.\n\nA language is mathematically defined as something like the following:  \na syntax + a semantics [1].\nIe. you have to know how strings can be combined to form sentences.  \nThen you have to know how to associate meanings with those signs, how  \nthose signs relate to the world. This simplifies a lot as I don&#39;t  \nwant to write a book on the subject here.\n\nXML is original with respect to other language such as Java, JSON,  \netc, in that\n  - it defines a syntax, without defining the semantics,\n  - it uses URIs as name space identifiers [2]\n\nRDF/XML gives a  semantics to subset of XML documents. The linking of  \nRDF and XML is attractive, because RDF is a semantics without a  \nsyntax, and XML is a syntax without semantics, and both use URI  \nidentifiers. Whether RDF/XML is the best way to do this mapping or  \nnot is a good question. It works close to XML writers intuitions, but  \nperhaps it is not close enough. There are other proposals on the  \ntable such as TRiX that make the syntax reflect more closely the  \nsemantics.\n\nHenry\n\nPS. I add a few comments to your text below\n\n[1] see the image on the blog http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/ \nanswers_to_duck_typing_done\n     &quot;anwsers to duck typing done right&quot; which shows graphically how  \nsyntax and semantics are related\n[2] see &quot;Duck Typing Done right&quot;\n     http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/duck_typing_done_right\n     for an explanation as to why using URIs is a big improovement  \nover what other languages have to offer\n\nOn 22 Jun 2007, at 13:57, Elliotte Harold wrote:\n&gt; John D. Heintz wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There is nothing JSON does that XML can&#39;t (what is the data  \n&gt;&gt; equivalent\n&gt;&gt; of Turing Complete?), but JSON is much less costly (verbosity,\n&gt;&gt; programming weight) than XML for those things.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; An interesting question. I suspect that it&#39;s very hard to come up  \n&gt; with a language that isn&#39;t &quot;information complete&quot;. Essentially if  \n&gt; you have at least two states and an infinite space, anything can be  \n&gt; encoded. I suspect the only languages that are not &quot;information  \n&gt; complete&quot; would be ones with a finite number of strings.\n&gt;\n&gt; However just as Intercal is not an appropriate replacement for C,  \n&gt; and C++ is not an appropriate replacement for Java, there are  \n&gt; practical considerations beyond theoretical expressiveness that  \n&gt; come into play when choosing one&#39;s languages. The information space  \n&gt; that JSON handles well is large, but it is not nearly as large as  \n&gt; the information space of the Web. Structured data is a crutch  \n&gt; invented by computer scientists because they don&#39;t have computers  \n&gt; as powerful as a human brain. Tables, maps, list, trees and more  \n&gt; are all kludges designed to try to make some sense out of an  \n&gt; unordered, unstructured world.\n\nThat is taking the problem from the wrong angle I think. Tables,  \nmaps, lists, etc, are some well known structures that are easy to  \ncompute on. There are many others. The world is structured in many ways.\n\nThe main problem with JSON is that it does not natively support URIs  \n(see my [2]) as a result it is not optimally designed for Resource  \nOriented Architecture, which we need when working in a global  \ninformation space such as the web.\n\n&gt; XML and its tree structures are not a perfect representation of  \n&gt; human knowledge and the information we need to encode. However,  \n&gt; precisely because XML is less structured than maps and lists and  \n&gt; tables, it can handle more information than can be encoded in maps  \n&gt; and lists and tables. There are many, many examples where JSON (and  \n&gt; other map-list data structures) becomes practically unmanageable  \n&gt; but which XML handles without blinking.  However it&#39;s not a two-way  \n&gt; street. XML cannot only encode everything JSON can encode. It can  \n&gt; do so practically, usefully, and efficiently. The reverse is not true.\n\nYou can&#39;t have it both ways. XML is a tree, and it is less  \nstructured? Which do you want. XML is Markup Language. That&#39;s the  \nessence of it. XML can encode everything you are going to want to  \nsay, since it is a possible encoding of RDF, and RDF allows you to  \nsay pretty much everything, including absurdities.\n\n&gt; I hope one day soon there will be still less structured, more  \n&gt; generic information description languages that can well handle the  \n&gt; information structures XML cannot.\n\nThe thing to remember is that XML is a syntax, not a language. It&#39;s a  \nway to markup text documents. The main use case of the language was  \nto start of with text documents that make sense as written and mark  \nup information in them. This is not always what one wants to do.  \nSometimes one has data in a database that is not in a document  \nformat, but just a bunch of relations, that one wants to make available.\n\nIf you are going to look at generality of structures, I&#39;d venture  \nthat relations are the most general structure in existence. Relating  \ntwo things or a thing and it&#39;s properties is pretty much the most  \nbasic thing you can do. Everything else: trees, tables, etc, can be  \nbuilt out of that.\n\nHenry\n\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\n&gt; Java I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\n&gt; http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\n&gt; http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/ \n&gt; cafeaulaitA/\n\n\n"}}
