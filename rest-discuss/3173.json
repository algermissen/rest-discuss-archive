Once you have received a specific message (indicated via the\ninbox), POST its URI to the URI of the mail resource you want it to be put\nin:\n\nPOST /mail/trash\n\nhttp://sample.invalid/mail/inbox/0013\n\n\nThis would remove the link from the inbox and place it in the &quot;trash&quot;.  Of\ncourse, you could always just DELETE the URI directly if you were done with\nit.\n\nAt any rate, all you would ever have to do to check for mail would be to\n&quot;GET /mail/inbox&quot;.\n\nSimple and clean... I think.  :)\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;S.
