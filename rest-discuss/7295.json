An Atompub server should drive interaction with\nclients using forms, to indicate to the client what data the server\nneeds, and can accept.\n\nAtom entry documents were originally designed to deliver information\nto clients. Using them to introduce information to the server raises\nsome issues that working group has mostly resolved; but these issues\nwouldn&#39;t be issues if Atom servers behaved like web servers serving\nHTML forms to humans.\n\nExample: the group spent some cycles deciding, Who sets atom:id? Must\nthe server preserve it if the client submits it? Hey -- it&#39;s a\nrequired element... should we require clients to submit invalid\ndocuments? etc. etc. This wouldn&#39;t be much of an issue if the client\nfirst retrieved a form from the server, and the server either\nrequested that information or didn&#39;t.\n\nAnother one: Any feature of the Atom &quot;data model&quot; that doesn&#39;t exactly\nconform to the server&#39;s model. My server knows about exactly one\nauthor for a document. What do I do if you POST me an entry  having\nmultiple authors and some contributors too? And how can I tell you I\ndon&#39;t support those extra authors, so you can display the proper UI?\nIf you had initially requested the form from me, I would have only\npermitted you to submit one author and no contributors. In your UI you\nwould gray out the extra fields my server doesn&#39;t support.\n\nA forms pattern would also permit us to evolve the document format safely.\n\nThe forms here would be Xform models. Basically they are empty XML\ntemplates for the client to fill out. They&#39;re not perfect, but good\nenough for this job, standardized, and XML friendly. You would GET the\nform from the link rel=&quot;edit&quot; URI.\n\nI am airing this out on this list because I recognize it&#39;s late in the\nday for Atompub, and because I also think a reaction to this idea on\nthe WG would be, Huh? And then, You mean parse a form programatically?\nSeriously? Dude, I have some blog software to finish.\n\n(This mail mostly just embellishes on [1].)\n\nInterested to hear what you all think, esp. the lurking Atompubbers.\n(Don&#39;t see any history of this idea on the Wiki)\n\nHugh\n\n[1] http://hughw.blogspot.com/2006/12/is-atompub-superfluous.html\n\n"}}
