Yes the items \nwithin page 2 of the list change, but the meaning of the resource, &quot;the \ncurrent items on page two&quot;, is constant.\n\nIt&#39;s similar to a &quot;current price of stock X&quot; resource, the content \nchanges over time, but the meaning of the resource is constant.\n\nPaul.\n\nMichal Migurski wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Signal vs. Noise has a post today about endless scrolling:\n&gt; http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/no_more_more_pages.php \n&gt; &lt;http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/no_more_more_pages.php&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s a whiz-bang sort of effect, where scrolling to the bottom of a\n&gt; list page triggers a JS-powered load of more list items. These are\n&gt; appended to the page, the scroll bar is adjusted to reflect the new\n&gt; height of the page, and you can keep scrolling down for more. This is\n&gt; in contrast to the traditional &quot;Page 2&quot; / &quot;See Next n Items&quot; method\n&gt; of advancing the list.\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s quite anti-REST, but it got me thinking about how the\n&gt; traditional numbered-page method also breaks with REST. My feeling is\n&gt; that the URL should point to a consistent resource, which changes in\n&gt; a paged environment. Page 2 means one thing one day, something else\n&gt; on another, depending on what new items have been added to the list\n&gt; in the meantime.\n&gt;\n&gt; I can think of two ways to change this:\n&gt;\n&gt; Instead of using page numbers, use item identifiers. The permanent\n&gt; URL for a set of items wouldn&#39;t change.\n&gt;\n&gt; Instead of numbering from the most recent, number from the oldest.\n&gt; Page 1 will always have the same set of oldest items, while the page\n&gt; number for the newest items will grow indefinitely. Of course this\n&gt; only works if there is a clear beginning to things.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thoughts?\n&gt; -mike.\n&gt;\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; michal migurski- contact info and pgp key:\n&gt; sf/ca http://mike.teczno.com/contact.html \n&gt; &lt;http://mike.teczno.com/contact.html&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
