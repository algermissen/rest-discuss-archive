REST people view &quot;protocol independence&quot; as\n&gt; over-engineering, and try to stick with HTTP.\n\n I don&#39;t know about that. In the REST infrastructure that I&#39;ve been\nworking we have a HTTP connector but also a JMS, a IMAP, a intraVM and\na JCR connector, and others will be implemented as needed.\n\n&gt; b) With email the only only &quot;verb&quot; is to send a message. The &quot;real&quot; verb\n&gt; will end up inside the message body, thus making it an RPC.\n\nSince the majority of tools and libraries and even expertise on REST\nis within the HTTP environment, and also because that was the first\nconnector we developed, it is true that the others are &quot;modelled&quot;\naround HTTP, and so we have to put the GET etc... in other places\nconvenient for each connector. But I don&#39;t think that makes it RPC, as\nall of the connectors connects to the same &quot;abstract resource&quot; (the\nclass where the &quot;services&quot; each individual resource provides are\ninjected, Java based), so all the processing is the same for all the\nconnectors. Actually, if it wasn&#39;t like this we could not have a\nuniform interface in all the connectors, that is what it&#39;s important\nfor us (let the client choose the way it connects to the resources\nmaintaining the same interface).\n\n"}}
