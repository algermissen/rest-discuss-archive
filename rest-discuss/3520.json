Must&#39;ve outsourced the\n&gt; marketing literature...\n&gt;\n&gt; ===\n&gt; Speakers\n&gt;  Ed Bratt Sun Microsystems\n&gt;\n&gt; Abstract\n&gt; This presentation compares and contrasts Web service integration styles as\n&gt; described by Relational State Transfer (REST) and SOAP-based Web services.\n&gt; Advantages and challenges of each style are compared and integration\n&gt; examples are reviewed in the context of the Sun TM Open Net Environment\n(Sun\n&gt; ONE) platform Integration Server. Is it really possible to use GET and PUT\n&gt; exclusively to integrate both with and across my firewall? What do I gain\nby\n&gt; using the traditional Web service architecture approach? These and other\n&gt; issues are presented.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
