Mike Dierken wrote:\n&gt;&gt; What about:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 4.  Multiple representations\n&gt;&gt; What if we want the resource to appear inside an edit form, \n&gt;&gt; instead of having an edit form as part of the resource or \n&gt;&gt; linked to the resource.  \n&gt; I think that&#39;s the same as my 3) Other Resources - in your example the\n&gt; server would include the content of the first resource within a &lt;textarea&gt;.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was going to provide an example where the resource was an image, to make\n&gt; it harder to use that resource directly for editing. But I didn&#39;t have time,\n&gt; my burgers were smoking on the grill...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m actually using this format:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; http://example.com/resource;view=edit\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; This URL is another representation of the URI http://example.com/resource \n&gt; Also, it&#39;s more than just another representation, it&#39;s another resource. How\n&gt; is the view=edit resource discovered? (I think that&#39;s part of the original\n&gt; question).\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; with the content of the page in a &lt;textarea&gt;.  \n&gt;&gt; It is access-controlled via HTTP AUTH, /resource is not.  \n&gt;&gt; The PUT goes to /resource upon form submission.\n\nBecause it is another resource, I was under the impression that modifying the \nURI by adding ;view=edit (or ?view=edit) is a &quot;no-no&quot;.\n\nScott\n\n"}}
