In your example, I know that I can POST a\n&gt; mime/rfc822 because the inbox is message/delivery. But your doc is one\n&gt; line because the documentation of these content-type has already been\n&gt; done. Someone can&#39;t use your message system without reading all the mime\n&gt; stuff... quite long!...\n\nYou need to define/select content-types *no matter what*.  My point is that \nyou DON&#39;T need to define the behavior of HTTP methods because RFC2616 \nalready does that.  If you are defining behavior for existing HTTP methods, \nyou are probably violating the RFC.  And if you don&#39;t want to read the MIME \nRFCs, define a shorter content-type format:\n\n===Syntax===\ntext/notification-container: part*\npart: location? &quot;&#92;n&quot; text/notification &quot;&#92;n&quot;\nlocation: URL\ntext/notification: (name-value-pair &#92;s)*\nname-value-pair: name &quot;:&quot; value &quot;&#92;n&quot;\nname: [^&#92;s:]+\nvalue: [^&#92;n&lt;&gt;]*\nidentity: value &quot;&lt;&quot; [A-z0-9]+ &quot;@&quot; DOMAIN-NAME &quot;&gt;&quot;\n==Semantics==\n&quot;Location&quot; name identifies notified resource. requires URL value\n&quot;From&quot; name identifies notifier, requires identity value\n\nHmm 12 more lines in ~5 min.  Still much less work than all of RNA.\n\nNote: Your container syntax MUST be a container for MIME types or you can&#39;t \nPOST to it.\n\n&gt; If I state somewhere that the index format used in a system IS a\n&gt; container, then you can not say that nothing is imply any more, and it&#39;s\n&gt; again juste one line (as long as &quot;container&quot; is supposed known, i.e. you\n&gt; don&#39;t need to describe a container behaviour, which is not so\n&gt; obvious...). That is what I mean by &quot;super-types&quot;. a message/digest IS a\n&gt; container, an RSS feed IS a container, a directory index IS a\n&gt; container...\n\nAn index is, by definition, a container only of pointers and not of the \nindexed information itself.  You can *say* otherwise.  It just wouldn&#39;t be \ntrue.\n\n&quot;Back to back, they faced each other, drew their swords and shot each \nother.&quot;\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
