October 17, 2002) - MIB Group, Inc. announced today the\navailability of a set of Web services that extend in-house IT business\nsolutions to clients by providing software functionality directly via the\nWeb versus a standalone application.  Included are MIB&#39;s Security Alert\nEntity Look-up Utility and Security Alert ID Look-up Utility, both research\ncompanions to MIB&#39;s Security Alert Services (SAS) compliance solution for\nthe USA PATRIOT Act (OFAC) and OSFI Canadian regulations.  These Web\nservices retrieve all available information on specific &quot;denied parties&quot;\ndirectly from the OFAC or OSFI web sites, on a manual or fully integrated\nbasis.\n\nMIB Web services use an architectural style called REST (Representational\nState Transfer) that employs standard Internet technologies (XML, URI and\nHTTP) to provide quick, simple integration with a customers&#39; existing\nbusiness systems.  Accessing MIB&#39;s Web services is easy, and users have the\noption of receiving formatted HTML or native XML.  The Web services also\nensures that users of MIB&#39;s Security Alert Services compliance reports are\nseeing the most up-to-date information available from both OFAC and OSFI.\n\n&quot;We evaluated all available Web service architectural solutions and found\nthat URI-centric REST is simple, elegant and based entirely on HTTP. Our\ncustomers will enjoy the ease of getting XML output from this service by\nusing conventional URLs and by sending HTTP requests to the specified MIB\nWeb address,&quot; states Alex Klevitsky, MIB&#39;s Enterprise Systems Architect.\n\n&quot;MIB Web services characterizes a company-wide effort towards a\nservice-oriented architecture, providing a universal integration platform\nfor MIB clientele. This is an important move forward in the next generation\nInternet delivering tighter business relationships and more efficient\nbusiness processes,&quot; says Robert L. DiAngelo, MIB&#39;s Chief Information\nOfficer.\n\nBoth Klevitsky and DiAngelo see Web services based on REST, along with its\nSimple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) counterpart, playing major roles as MIB\ncontinues to reengineer core business systems and deploy new functionality\nto clients.\n\n\n About MIB Group, Inc.\n\nMIB Group, Inc., headquartered in Westwood, Massachusetts, is the premier\nprovider of Internet-based information and knowledge services to the global\nrisk management market space, and is a leading facilitator of electronic\ninsurance commerce via dedicated networks and Internet-based systems.
