But if the time exposed from my resource is server time (I don&#39;t want the client input time), should I use PUT or POST? Thanks.\n\nI think this is largely orthogonal.\n\nYou could PUT a representation that indicates how it should relate to \nserver time (whether by ignoring it in the representation and using the \ncurrent time, or by sending an offset, or a time in UTC, which server \ntime should maintain anyway - though perhaps rendering to a given local \ntime for UI).\n\nYou could POST a representation that indicates an action taken, which \nsimilarly relates to server time.\n\n\n"}}
