Taking an arbitrary RPC system and\n&gt; putting it on the Web is a very difficult task. But more than\n&gt; &quot;difficult&quot;, it&#39;s *design*, and machines aren&#39;t very good at design.\n&gt; For example, the URIs the tool would generate (e.g. if it found a\n&gt; getFoo() method) would suck, because there&#39;s typically no way (and\n&gt; definitely no general way) to identify resources and their naming\n&gt; structure via RPC interfaces (you&#39;re actually better off going\n&gt; straight to the data). As another example, the granularity of data\n&gt; access normally needs to be designed, IME; getFoo() and getBar() on\n&gt; the same object might be better off as two URIs, or as a single URI\n&gt; which returns both kinds of data (ala\n&gt; &lt;root&gt;&lt;Foo&gt;foo&lt;/Foo&gt;&lt;Bar&gt;bar&lt;/Bar&gt;&lt;/root&gt;). There&#39;s many many other\n&gt; considerations.\n\nRight, it is often harmful to REST design to start with an RPC-style\ninterface and work backwards from functionality.  If a group already\nhas an RPC implementation, then presumably there is something wrong\nwith the architecture if they want to change it to the REST style.\nArchitectural change isn&#39;t like changing door knobs or painting\nthe garage a different color -- it is fundamental.  That is, unless\nthe RPC is already architected as a data-oriented interface, in which\ncase the translation is easy to automate (though extremely rare in\npractice).\n\nAn interesting idea would be to look at the back-end of a working\nsystem and try to anticipate a REST architecture on the basis of\nthe observed data flow.  And yet, that too is filled with risk,\nsince the existing RPC may be causing the data-flow to be unnatural,\nwhich in turn is why the system needs to be redesigned.  JCR,\nfor example, forces the front-end to be data-oriented and then\nallows the back-end to be adjusted for storage-efficiency.\n\nI have yet to see an acceptable building that was designed by a\ncomputer, even with extensive rule-based systems.  I see no reason\nto believe a network-based application would be any different.\nSounds like a good research area, though.\n\nMaybe I am showing my age, but there used to be a great deal of\ndebate about the proper way to analyze customer requirements and\ndesign accordingly.  Much of that was suppressed by the rise of\nOOD consulting.  It would be interesting to see what would happen\nif someone were to dredge up Jackson System Design (JSD) methodology\nand customize it specifically for REST-like architectures.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
