I didn&#39;t know that.  ...figured that the interactions with the \nserver would be too intimate to make the client-side protocol generic.\n\n&gt; Yeah... I&#39;d rather see the connection opened by the client & the roles\n&gt; reversed via a magic command - how about a new HTTP method of &#39;LISTEN&#39;?\n\nNot sure it&#39;s necessary!  I think that you can use the Upgrade header --  \nhttp://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.42\n\n&#39; The Upgrade header field is intended to provide a simple mechanism for \ntransition from HTTP/1.1 to some other, incompatible protocol. It does so \nby allowing the client to advertise its desire to use another protocol, \nsuch as a later version of HTTP with a higher major version number, even \nthough the current request has been made using HTTP/1.1. This eases the \ndifficult transition between incompatible protocols by allowing the \nclient to initiate a request in the more commonly supported protocol \nwhile indicating to the server that it would like to use a &quot;better&quot; \nprotocol if available (where &quot;better&quot; is determined by the server, \npossibly according to the nature of the method and/or resource being \nrequested). &#39;\n\n(major caveat emptor on everything I have to say here: the only actual\ncode I have is a bunch of munged Tomcat source.)\n\n\n"}}
