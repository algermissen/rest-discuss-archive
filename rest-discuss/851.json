Let me see if I can try this again.  Let&#39;s say you&#39;ve got a\nresource named\n\n    http://foo.com/some/data/producer\n\nThis is a processing container resource, let&#39;s say.  It emits representations as a\nresult of GET operations, and this rep describes the &quot;current&quot; state of the container\n--- which changes rapidly.  These representations vary rapidly, so that potentially\neach representation emitted in response to a request is in fact different.  Those\nrepresentations are not individually addressible --- I seriously doubt that many\narchitects would advocate giving each unique representation its own URI for use in\nContent-Location.  Content-Location is great for coarse-grained / relatively static\nuse and where it&#39;s appropriate, but it doesn&#39;t help out in the general case where a\nresource has an arbitrary and time-varying number of representations.\n\nBut as I said, this isn&#39;t really problematic, except in areas like caching and\narchiving.  The former is easily dealt with --- resources which emit varying reps\nsimply manage cache behavior closely or disable it, while in the latter case various\nre-write mechanisms (yuck!) generally suffice.  (And generally speaking, you don&#39;t\nwant to be archiving all the reps emitted by a highly variant resource anyway.)\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
