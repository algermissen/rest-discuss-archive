WTF?  I mean, this problem&#39;s as \nold as the web, distributing named userspace directories /~someuser/ across \nmultiple servers has long been a problem *with a solution* that doesn&#39;t \ninconvenience users like this!\n\n[[So we have developed a DNS (Domain Name System) based solution that allows \nus to redirect requests to the right data center and allows us to keep a \nbetter looking URL. Moving the Space name into the domain name is a \nrequirement of that.]]\n\nHere we are in 2006, and the best M$ can come up with is to make usernames \n_hostnames_ which enables them to resort to an oh-so-stuck-in-1994 DNS round-\nrobin with a copy of each user&#39;s directory on each server in the farm.  LAME!\n\n[[We needed to deliver a system that allows for Spaces to be distributed \nacross multiple data centers without requiring a URL that included the data \ncenter name. How unkewl would that be? Can you imagine telling your friends \nand family that the URL to your space was http://cluster25.dc1.spaces.msn.com/\ngphipps?]]\n\nWhat kind of ludicrous excuse is that?  It&#39;s as if Microsoft thinks they&#39;re \ninnovating a new solution to distributing a web app based on the mistaken \nassumption that nobody has ever accomplished this without putting the DC name \nin the URL.\n\nMicrosoft, the only &quot;unkewl&quot; thing is that you have yet to figure out that \nthe URI and the application layer are separate, i.e. they&#39;re only \n_orthogonally_ related.  What&#39;s particularly galling, is that you believe \nthis is a necessary middle step in order to accomplish the objective of \nconverting http://spaces.msn.com/user/* to http://spaces.live.com/user/*.\n\n[[Doing the rearchitecture work and making the move to Live Spaces was not \npossible for a number of technical reasons. This is why we can?t move \nstraight to the spaces.live.com name.]]\n\nHow is it even *possible* that Microsoft can&#39;t figure out a way to abstract \nthis, instead of building it into the architecture?  Instead they expect \nkudos for inconveniencing their customers in the name of &quot;innovating&quot; DNS \nround-robin load balancing.  :-0  That is so, like, totally last century!\n\nSeriously, here&#39;s the solution they missed:\n\nhttp://www.iwdn.net/showthread.php?t=4288\n\nYeah, okay, my solution is also like, totally last century, but one which is \nstill valid today in a way DNS round-robin isn&#39;t.\n\n[[However, we believe that when we do move to Live Spaces that will be the \nlast time we have to change the URL.]]\n\nI&#39;ll bet you anything, not. Microsoft has just proven that they have \nabsolutely no grasp of web architecture whatsoever, particularly when it \ncomes to URI design, and the separation of concerns. If they understood these \nthings, changing a domain name wouldn&#39;t cause them so many fits. Since they \ndon&#39;t understand how the web works, they&#39;ll likely &quot;need&quot; to change their \nURLs again in the future.  How on Earth did Microsoft fail to &quot;innovate&quot; \ndynamic mirror for this oh-so-difficult &lt;/snark&gt; domain-name change?  Whining \nabout how large the service is is not an excuse for screwing up the \narchitecture in the first place.\n\nThis sort of change should have been possible to do, regardless of how many \nusers Microsoft (has | makes claim to), by flipping a switch without any \ntemporary URIs, or hassle to their users.  Talk about making a mountain out \nof a molehill.  Pointing to the mountain you&#39;ve created and saying &quot;but can&#39;t \nyou see there&#39;s a mountain there&quot; just isn&#39;t, you know, &quot;kewl.&quot;\n\n[2] http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
