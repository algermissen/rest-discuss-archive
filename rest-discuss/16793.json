I&#39;=\r\nm struggling with the correct, RESTful way to do that. Here&#39;s the ways I&#39;ve=\r\n thought of and they all seem to have problems:\n\n1. /players/types. This se=\r\nems the closest to other things I&#39;ve seen out there (e.g. atom categories),=\r\n but it looks weird to me because I expect /players/{id}, but &quot;types&quot; isn&#39;t=\r\n really an id.\n\n2. /players/{id}/types. This seems okay if you already have=\r\n an id, but since players are created dynamically, the client won&#39;t know th=\r\ne id beforehand. And you need to know the type of player to create one. Add=\r\nitionally, the types supported by a specific player instance may mean somet=\r\nhing else (e.g. it could mean the types its compatible rather than types yo=\r\nu can create).\n\n3. /player-types. This seems a little ugly to me, but maybe=\r\n it&#39;s fine?\n\nIs there a good way to do this?\n\n\n\n"}}
