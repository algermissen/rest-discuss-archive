There, they give you a pamphlet that says\n&quot;Hall of Records Offices for the year 2013&quot;. It tells you that Birth\nCertificates are on the 3rd floor, Office 304. And off you go.\n\nNext  year, you come back, being as you managed to lose it again, and\nneed a new copy. Instead of stopping at the info kiosk, you refer to\nyour pamphlet that you kept. Mind, it&#39;s not 2014. You go straight to\nroom 304 -- The Regional Planning office. Oops. But look, there&#39;s a\nsign: &quot;Birth Records moved to room 417&quot; Success, off you go.\n\nTwo years later, we&#39;re back...and off we go to 417 -- The Probation\nOffice. Oh no! And ever worse, no sign! The office moved over a year\nago and the sign is only kept up for 6 months. Now you&#39;re stuck\nwalking back down to the info kiosk and starting over.\n\nThis is an example of using a well know entry point, the ability to\ncache information, as well as specifying the Cache Expiration date.\n\nIf you have reasonable caching on your main entry points, then clients\ncan fetch the &quot;directory&quot; once, and rely on it internally to look up\naddresses, effectively giving you the same benefit of bookmarking the\nabsolute end point, but with the consent of the service so that it is\nfree to remain nimble and move things as they see fit. Internally, you\nclient should perform the same task: &quot;GET http://example.com/entry&quot;,\nbut your internal infrastructure should realize it&#39;s cached, and\nalready marshaled and simply return a copy of the internal form rather\nthan requesting it again. Speedy.\n\nIt works as a good solution to &quot;why do I have to constantly ask for\nthe same information?&quot;. If it is, in fact, &quot;the same information&quot;,\nthen the service &quot;knows that&quot; and can (should) tell you a valid\nlifespan for that information. It&#39;s a contract between the service and\nthe clients. If the service refuses to commit to this information,\nthen they deserve to be hammered with redundant requests and emails\nfrom clients that &quot;their server is too slow&quot;. Fix it.\n\nBy the same token, if a service decides to change an internal service\naddress &quot;suddenly&quot;, then it&#39;s the client that&#39;s breaking the contract\n-- let them eat 404s.\n\nBut, in general, I do look at REST systems much like paper based\nsystems. And if you want to add Asynchronous aspects to the system,\nthen you consider those old days of stuffing notes in carriers and\nshoving them in to vacuum tubes. There -- an async architecture :)\n\n-- \nCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: The information contained in this electronic \ntransmission may be confidential.
