They both (in different ways) tackle the problem of  \nhow do you get a community/ecosystem to change the way they think  \nabout a problem...\n\n&gt; Is it a right move to start to work on *more concrete* practical\n&gt; guidelines, toolkit, frameworks, to provide developers a clear path on\n&gt; how to restify their apps start from analysis and design phase til the\n&gt; implementation. Or is it better to just leave developers to figure out\n&gt; things in their own way?\n\nLike they say, I believe the right solution is to &quot;think globally,  \nact locally.&quot; :-)   The &#39;right&#39; answer to your question depends on  \nthe optimal match between your resources (skills, contacts,  \nreputation, passion) and the communities needs.  I suspect all of us  \nhere believe that &quot;REST&quot; is the answer -- we&#39;re just trying to find  \nthe question. :-)  The challenge, in other words, is identifying what  \nthe actual barriers are that prevent/discourage people from adopting  \nREST, and we each individually can do within our own trust networks.\n\nTo your particular question, I believe the optimal approach is to be  \n&quot;exemplary&quot; rather than &quot;normative.&quot;  That is, rather than trying to  \nsay, &quot;You -should- do it this way,&quot; we demonstrate the virtue of REST  \nby saying, &quot;This is how *I* do it, which is really easy for you to  \nadopt.&quot;  We don&#39;t try to enforce consistency -- we merely make it the  \npath of least resistance!\n\nFor example, one idea I&#39;ve been toying with is creating a  \n&quot;rest_scaffold&quot; that would make it trivial to RESTify &quot;Ruby on  \nRails&quot;. As a bonus, it would use XHTML as the encoding so that the  \nsame app could be used with: i) web browsers, ii) web services, and  \niii) AJAX.   I suspect something like this would simultaneously lower  \nbarriers to entry and create a compelling value proposition -- both  \nof which are essential for adoption.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nSee my blog (below) for more details.\n\nBest,\n-- Ernie P.\n\nOn Oct 20, 2005, at 5:00 PM, toydi wrote:\n\n&gt; On 10/20/05, Bob Haugen &lt;bob.haugen@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Do you think that CORBA and SOAP do not require people to follow  \n&gt; a set of rules?\n&gt; &gt; Do you think those rules are simpler and easier than REST?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The great majority of users of Amazon&#39;s Web services found REST  \n&gt; easier\n&gt; &gt; than SOAP.\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s a good sign indeed. :)\n&gt;\n&gt; I always feel that ReST provides a more *natural* way to see things in\n&gt; a distributed web environment.

Or is it better to just leave developers to figure out\n&gt; things in their own way?\n&gt;\n&gt; The point in my previous message is, if we work on these guidelines\n&gt; and framework, how to balance between &quot;developers need to change a\n&gt; lot&quot; and &quot;developers still flexible to do things their own way&quot;. How\n&gt; to balance so that guidelines will not become a strict standard, but\n&gt; still provide a common understanding platform to allow further\n&gt; discussion and developement.\n&gt;\n&gt; (Recently, I&#39;m thinking whether it&#39;s the right time to work on\n&gt; practical guidelines and toolkit for ReST app development start from\n&gt; analysis phase to implementation. Hopefully it will not try to\n&gt; reinvent the whole wheel cycle, but rather to analyze the essential\n&gt; needs in ReST app developement, then firgure out how to reuse\n&gt; available tools and resources.)\n\n------------\nErnest N.
