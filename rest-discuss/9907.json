PAUSE (Perl Authors Upload\n\nThere&#39;s a thread going now (&quot;are cookies EVER restful&quot;) that seems to be \nsettling on HTTP auth as a good alternative to cookies for remembering the \nlogged in user.  Some folks \n(http://www.peej.co.uk/articles/http-auth-with-html-forms.html) have \nformulated pretty good ideas for making it work.  I also saw a blog \nentry (cannot find it just now) that has a nice method for logoff: have \nONE route in your application accept &quot;logoff&quot; as the user and make sure \nall the OTHER pages reject (401) &quot;logoff&quot; as a user.  Logoff is as simple \nas firing an XHR to that logoff page with &quot;logoff&quot; as the user and then \nredirecting to another page.  Seems pretty straightforward to me (and I&#39;ll \nbe exploring this, but I think it&#39;ll work across all browsers that support \nXMLHTTPRequest (XHR).\n\nSo might this be a good, standard method for remebering the user? (Better, \nat least, than cookies?).\n\n-peter\n\n\n"}}
