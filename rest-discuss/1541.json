As I mentioned\n&gt; &gt; before, I have a pre-developed set of resource types, namely methods,\n&gt; &gt; components, topics, queues, etc that are published in a node&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; hierarchical namespace.\n&gt;\n&gt; I guess the basic question is whether you *need* method objects. A\n&gt; REST-purist view would be that you should use methods as an\n&gt; implementation technique to implement a resource view of the world.\n&gt; Since I don&#39;t know what method objects you have, I can&#39;t\n&gt; resource-decompose them. But in most cases you will want an action to\n&gt; have a side-effect that creates a resource+URI, and you will want the\n&gt; newly created resource to be in some container. So you can\n&gt; instead use a POST on the container.\n\nMy question was &quot;what are you posting to?&quot; and that&#39;s where I came up with the\nidea of creating method resources, which have URIs (if they are published), can\nbe invoked via POST, and need to exist in a container.  GETing, PUTing, and\nDELETEing methods act on the resource itself.\n\n&gt; &gt;...\n&gt; &gt; HTTP PUT - instead of getting a pre-existing resource like the one\n&gt; &gt; above, it allows you to effectively copy a resource in its current\n&gt; &gt; state to another node. You are effectively publishing it on the\n&gt; &gt; destination node.\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s not clear to me how you can copy a method. After all, the real\n&gt; method is the programming code behind it. And that code will\n&gt; depend on a complex network of other state. So PUT-ting to a method\n&gt; resource doesn&#39;t make much sense to me.\n\nSorry about that - I&#39;ll clarify.  One thing I forgot to write into my original\nmethod example was a &quot;localHost&quot; property that references the component where\nthe implementation of the method is hosted.  So if you merely copy the method\nresource, it then exists in a new container but references the same\nimplementation.\n\nSo if you wanted to do what you thought I meant in your response, you would also\nneed to copy the component to a new location, update new method&#39;s localHost URI,\nand integrate the new component into its environment.  If the destination node\nwas identical to the source (code doesn&#39;t always depend on a complex network of\nstate), then it might work without modification.\n\nI agree with you, PUTing to a method resource doesn&#39;t make sense. Instead, you\nwould want to PUT the method to a container.  Is that more clear?  Like Roger, I\nwant to make sure my work reflects resolve on these issues.\n\n-Philip\n\n\n"}}
