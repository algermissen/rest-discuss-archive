Bowman wrote:\n&gt; &gt; My friends have asked me to attempt to explain REST to them \n&gt; in terms \n&gt; &gt; they can understand. Which means I can&#39;t use the word &quot;semantics&quot;, \n&gt; &gt; basically. ;) I thought it best to use analogy instead of \n&gt; &gt; software-architecture examples, for starters my primary concern is \n&gt; &gt; explaining &quot;Resource&quot; in terms of basic set theory by sticking with \n&gt; &gt; apples and oranges.\n&gt; \n&gt; Resources are easy to explain. Resources are like objects. \n&gt; They demarcate application state in the same way as objects. \n&gt; The web is full of resources like a java program is full of \n&gt; objects. The main difference is in how you interact with them.\n&gt; \n&gt; First of all, resources have only one type. We don&#39;t need \n&gt; baseclasses or interface classes. We only have resources. \n&gt; Resources can be found using a single identifier scheme. \n&gt; Think pointers. Once you have a pointer to the resource, you \n&gt; can call invoke methods on it. These methods might be issued \n&gt; directly to the resource, or might go through a proxy of some kind.\n&gt; \n&gt; Resources only have a limited set of methods, and each of \n&gt; these methods are based around transfering a document per \n&gt; invocation rather than a parameter list. If you were to \n&gt; ascribe member variables (or state, or just plain \n&gt; information) to your object, they would form the schema \n&gt; behind the documents you transfer. This schema can be \n&gt; transferred in several forms (representations). You could \n&gt; return a HTML document which listed out information held in \n&gt; your object. You could return an image, or some othe form of \n&gt; your state... but each representation conveys the same \n&gt; information. Updates should take on one of these forms and \n&gt; update the object atomically, rather than setting the value \n&gt; of one variable after the other over several invocations.\n&gt; \n&gt; All representations returned by a resource should be \n&gt; standard, ideally understood by every relevant piece of \n&gt; software in the world.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, you have a uniform resource locator scheme (a pointer). \n&gt; You have uniform methods that accept and/or return a document \n&gt; and tell you which encoding is used in the document. Each \n&gt; document is of a standard type.\n&gt; Because everything looks the same, sometimes you need extra \n&gt; resources to represent different facets of what might \n&gt; conceptually have been one object in a less constrained environment.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s REST without the oranges.\n&gt; \n&gt; Concrete example?\n&gt; \n&gt; Client -&gt; Server\n&gt; GET http://example.com/lightbulb HTTP/1.1\n&gt; \n&gt; Server -&gt; Client\n&gt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n&gt; Content-Type: text/plain\n&gt; \n&gt; on\n&gt; \n&gt; Client -&gt; Server\n&gt; PUT http://example.com/lightbulb HTTP/1.1\n&gt; Content-Type: text/plain\n&gt; \n&gt; off\n&gt; \n&gt; Server -&gt; Client\n&gt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n&gt; \n&gt; See also\n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer\n&gt; http://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FrontPage\n&gt; \n&gt; Benjamin.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
