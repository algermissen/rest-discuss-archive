I don&#39;t have a problem with that. The one thing to consider is, as \nothers have pointed out, whether it would make sense to use &quot;service&quot; \ninstead and let that point back to the same URI (assuming we have a \nproper definition of &quot;service&quot; :-)\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n"}}
