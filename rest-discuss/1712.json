Suppose that for obvious reasons\n&gt; you want to be able to restrict who can add, update or delete particular\n&gt; types of attachments.\n&gt;\n&gt; Without having individual sub-resources for each of the types in question\n&gt; there appears to be no way to setup this style of security using ACL. If\n&gt; you do choose the sub-resources approach, what happens when your security\n&gt; requirements change? Do you then have to change your resources to match?\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there something I am missing in my understanding of the use of ACL in\n&gt; REST, as this approach appears too fragile and inter-dependant for my\n&gt; liking?\n\nConceptually, I think applying ACLs as associations between users/groups and\nresources/representations and HTTP methods makes a lot of sense.  For example:\n\n  Allow(philip, GET, resource1)\n  Allow(administrators, *, *)\n  Deny (guests, *, POST)\n  Deny (*.microsoft.com, *, *)  ;-)\n\nThese could be declared in XML and could be applied to any logical or physical\nlocation in a node&#39;s namespace.\n\nThen S. Mike wrote in response:\n&gt; If I had an ACL system that was aware of HTTP messages, I could filter\n&gt; on portion of the message - method, content-type, user-id, etc.:\n\nDefinitely.  I immediately think about filters being a great place to do\nthis....not only to filter at the HTTP message header level, but also at the ACL\npolicy level (e.g., what I show above declared above and beyond optional or\nmandatory header fields).\n\nGood topic.\n\n-Philip\n\nPS: I just got back from a week of scuba diving in Key West.  During a deep\nwreck dive, I think I achieved Zen on REST and methods.  Let me get caught up\nand I&#39;ll send my take.\n\n\n"}}
