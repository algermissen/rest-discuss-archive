It would be much more productive (again, IMHO) if\n&gt; we could talk in terms of specifics suggestions.\n\nI can itemize my complaints:\n\n * Shouldn&#39;t run at &quot;level 8&quot; but rather level 6 (on top of TCP, below\napp protocols)\n * Shouldn&#39;t use port 80 (in fact shouldn&#39;t have a predefined port at\nall)\n * Shouldn&#39;t use an envelope format that is hostile to binary data\n * Encoding should be separated out into a differently named spec and\nrethought from scratch.\n * RPC should probably be just removed.\n * Should have as a design requirement that it is a solid basis for\napplication protocols like a next generation HTTP or SMTP (i.e. the HTTP\nbinding for SOAP should be HTTP *over SOAP* not SOAP over HTTP)\n * Should use IP addresses rather than URIs for addressing (resource\naddressing is an application layer issue)\n\nI may have forgotten some but you get the gist. Generally, when you have\nso many complaints about a technology the easier way to say it is: &quot;It&#39;s\nall wrong.&quot; That offends people but it also saves their time.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; I also believe that most of the asserted virtues of either an all-GET (or\n\nI don&#39;t think anybody on this list would promote an all-GET approach\nunless the service was read-only.\n\n&gt; even a more-GET) approach seem to be stated in ways that go over the head\n&gt; of most of the intended audience - even when we had a VERY technical\n&gt; audience like we enjoyed at the ETCON.\n\nI agree that that is the case. If you do not have a background of\nthinking about information systems as addressable information spaces\n(many XML people do, most others don&#39;t) then it requires a mental change\nlike the shift from procedural programming to event-driven programming.\nSome (probably not Sam) feel that this demonstrates that the\ninformation-space model is doomed. My sense is that people make mental\nleaps when they need to, to solve a problem. Over the next few years it\nwill become clear whether this mental leap is really necessary or just\nconvenient for some problems. Object orientation took about twenty-five\nyears to overcome industry inertia and filter out to a point where\nordinary people understand it.\n\n&gt; The one point that I&#39;m most proud of is when I contrasted SOAP vs REST vs\n&gt; GET approaches in what I thought was a more digestible form.  I was\n&gt; pleasantly surprised that I got no pushback from those sitting to my right,\n&gt; in fact after the panel you seemed to indicate that I had not\n&gt; misrepresented REST.\n\nWell Dave Winer spoke after you so I didn&#39;t really have a chance to jump\nin. Different people have different definitions, just as they do about\nOO. Jeff Bone focuses on consistency of interfaces. I focus on\naddressability. IIRC, you focused on using the HTTP methods properly. I\ndon&#39;t think any of the definitions are right or wrong, they just address\ndifferent but related aspects. \n\nI focus on addressability because of my information-space background and\nbecause I feel that it is a particularly obvious weak point of the\nstandard web services stack. Even COM and CORBA have much more\ninteroperable addressing models than SOAP.\n\nYou said that there was a third camp that said to &quot;use GET for\neverything.&quot; That&#39;s a misunderstanding of REST but I don&#39;t know that it\nis any more pervasive than other misunderstandings, like &quot;use POST for\neverything&quot; (after all, as long as you use HTTP without SOAP you are\ndoing REST, right?). Some people also think that REST means\n&quot;asynchronous messaging&quot;. i.e. people think that whatever they like that\nis not SOAP must be REST. ;)\n\nBTW, you mentioned the Amazon associates API. From what I could see on\nSimon&#39;s page it *was* relatively REST-y. I am not an Amazon associate so\nI can&#39;t see the details of their API. Simon&#39;s summary is here:\n\n * http://www.xmlhack.com/read.php?item=1615\n\nI feel bad that I had to disclaim responsibility for it because I didn&#39;t\nmean to leave the Amazon people looking silly (I know they were in the\naudience). If there are parts of the API that use GET to mean PUT, POST\nor DELETE then I would agree that those parts aren&#39;t REST-y. The parts I\ncan see look like a good start towards full REST-yness.\n\n&gt; If others who had attended feel that this part was comprehendable beyond\n&gt; the scope of the people sitting on the panel, I will try to write it up.\n\nMy sense is that just as with OO, there are a variety of correct ways to\nsummarize the REST model. Your approach would probably be a valuable\naddition.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
