With that\n&gt; in mind the resource design could be done entirely separately from the\n&gt; domain design, but I&#39;m wondering whether this is sensible or whether\n&gt; you would recommend going further and getting stakeholders/domain\n&gt; experts involved in the resource design (possibly doing this whilst\n&gt; discussing the domain model itself).\n\nOnce the domain model is sorted out, I create a &quot;controller&quot; (it&#39;s not a \ncontroller in the usual sense) for each domain object. The controller \nresponds to methods on those objects - typically in the code this is \nlisting, filters, getBykey and create/update/delete operations. IOW I \ndon&#39;t create controllers organized around the invoked action, query \nstyle, or data structure unless the framework really wants me to do that.\n\nThese domain controllers talk to either a domain facade (manager) or a \nservice depending on how you have your code laid out.\n\nOne thing that&#39;s worth getting right (albeit an impl relative to the \nnetwork interface) is the repository pattern Evans talks about. Most \nimpls I&#39;ve seen claiming to be repositories this are in fact per table \nDAOs mapped direct to the RDBMS, but the full pattern is much more \nuseful and supports loose mapping onto things like mainframes, sharded \ndbs and LDAP systems. It&#39;s hard to see the value until you step outside \nthe usual database/LAMP installations.\n\nPartial updates are still a challenge practically speaking; I&#39;m leaning \ntowards forms POSTing directly to the resource. All the diff/delta based \napproaches I&#39;ve seen over POST/PATCH are too complicated to see adoption \nright now (this is problem with the various formats and not the PATCH \nmethod); a forms update is usable for developers.\n\nYou&#39;re right therre&#39;s no 1-1 mapping; as of yet this is considered a \nproblem for REST style approaches as opposed to a necessary impedance \nmismatch the way RDBMS/OO is; I think the MVC pattern will slowly \nreplaced by &quot;View ORMs&quot; - Object Resource Mappers.\n\nBill\n\n"}}
