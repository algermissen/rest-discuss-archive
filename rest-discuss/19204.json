[...]\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  Suggested reading: 6.5.2; 6.2.1, in particular:\n&gt;&gt; &quot;REST [defines] a resource to be the semantics of what the author\n&gt;&gt; intends to identify.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Exactly.  And we don&#39;t know what the author intends to identify just by\n&gt; looking at the path /orders/1/cancel.\n&gt;\n&gt; Just looking at the syntax of a single request (e.g. the method POST and/or\n&gt; the path /orders/1/cancel) is not enough to determine if the system adheres\n&gt; to any particular architectural style.\n&gt;\n&gt; The author may well intend that /cancel identifies a resource, and allow\n&gt; lots of interaction in it.  It might even have an HTML representation, with\n&gt; a nice &lt;form method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;CANCEL&quot;&gt;&lt;/form&gt; in\n&gt; it.\n&gt;\n&gt; But this is still not enough to determine if a system adheres to the\n&gt; constraints: For even though the server provides such hypermedia controls,\n&gt; media types and does everything &quot;by the book&quot;, it is still up to the\n&gt; *client* to actually *use* these hypermedia controls.  In fact it is up to\n&gt; the author of the agent itself.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you write code in the client that hard wires a button called &quot;cancel&quot; to\n&gt; the &quot;POST /orders/1/cancel&quot; HTTP request then the client isn&#39;t really\n&gt; honouring the hypermedia controls laid out above.  If, however, it _soft\n&gt; wires_ the same button _because_ of the hypermedia control above, then\n&gt; you&#39;re doing it &quot;more right&quot; I would say.  The point is that the client\n&gt; should be written in such a way that it uses _only_ the hypermedia controls\n&gt; that it receives at run-time.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Roy&#39;s thesis really must be considered in its entirety, [...]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; +1 to such a degree that 1 &gt; 1.  The rest of the stuff you wrote was great.\n&gt; I just want to highlight the incorrectness of the question, as others said\n&gt; earlier that REST doesn&#39;t say anything about if POST /foo is or isn&#39;t...\n&gt; For all we know /orders/1/cancel is a picture of a dog, or it could be a\n&gt; SOAP endpoint for a nice game of Global Thermonuclear War.\n&gt;\n&gt; The constraints of REST are too often thought / taught to deal with the\n&gt; server side, but in my experience, it has much more to do with the client\n&gt; side, how much knowledge the client has on things like:\n&gt;\n&gt; - what URLs can it use? (it shouldn&#39;t know any; but bind to one at run-time,\n&gt; preferably via a configuration parameter)\n&gt; - when it knows one URL (e.g. &quot;/orders/1&quot;), can it add &quot;/cancel&quot; to it to\n&gt; cancel it?  (no, unless it was told to add &quot;/cancel&quot; by a hypermedia\n&gt; control)\n&gt; - does it know the &quot;type&quot; of a resource, e.g. that /orders/1 is an Order\n&gt; (this is a point of contention on the list; browsers don&#39;t know about books\n&gt; or a bank account, but work fine nonetheless.)\n&gt; - when it does know the type of the URL is an order, does it pull up a\n&gt; pre-coded &quot;order&quot; UI (bad), or does it create a UI based on what it finds in\n&gt; the response (good)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; -mogsie-\n\n"}}
