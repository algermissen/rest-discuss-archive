Both of the above are necessary and \nimportant.\n\nAssuming you want to use rest-discuss for quibbles, here&#39;s one:\n&gt;REST describes a networked system in terms of \n&gt;   data elements (resource, resource identifier, representation) \n\nI don&#39;t think &quot;data element&quot; is an accurate description of a \nresource. I think resources are much more like large-grained very \ngeneric objects in that they have methods and identity.  Even the \nrepresentation does not need to be limited to &quot;just data&quot; (unless we \nconsider everything to be &quot;just data&quot;).\n\nMaybe &quot;object&quot; is not the correct word, either, but it&#39;s closer \nthan &quot;data element&quot;.\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
