Here is what you said \nin your dissertation:\n&lt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm&gt;\n\n&quot;&quot;&quot;\nThe central feature that distinguishes the REST architectural style from \nother network-based styles is its emphasis on a uniform interface between \ncomponents (Figure 5-6)[...]\nIn order to obtain a uniform interface, multiple architectural constraints \nare needed to guide the behavior of components. REST is defined by four \ninterface constraints: identification of resources; manipulation of \nresources through representations; self-descriptive messages; and, \nhypermedia as the engine of application state. These constraints will be \ndiscussed in Section 5.2.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;\n\nAnd in section 5.2 you say:\n\n&quot;&quot;&quot;\nMore precisely, a resource R is a temporally varying membership function \nMR(t), which for time t maps to a set of entities, or values, which are \nequivalent. The values in the set may be resource representations and/or \nresource identifiers\n&quot;&quot;&quot;\n\nSo, if my credit card company exposes \n&lt;https://www.accountonline.com/AccountSummary&gt;,\nthe content of which varies depending on a cookie, do you believe that \nresponse to a request for this URI is a representation of a REST style \nResource?  In particular, do you believe that my account information and \nyour account information are really different representations of the same \nunderlying resource (that they are &quot;equivalent&quot;) or that the resource \nidentified by this URI is simply changing rapidly depending on which of us \nis making a request at that exact moment?\n\nAlternatively, if my credit card company starts using HTTP-auth instead of \ncookie-auth, would that somehow make your account data and my account data \ndifferent representations of the same underlying resource?\n\nNote to Walden and the other folks on the legal-subpoena thread: We all \nhave a pretty clear notion of what &quot;my account&quot; means.  That the content of \nmy account changes over time (because I spend money or others steal it), \ndoesn&#39;t change its identity (Herclitus/flux arguments notwithstanding). \nThe issue here is simply whether or not the concept of &quot;Representation&quot; in \nRepresentational State Transfer is sufficiently broad so that a \n&quot;Representation&quot; is nothing more than the content return by an HTTP server \nat a specific moment in time.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.

Fielding&quot; \n&lt;fielding@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Crikey, you guys are getting all mixed up.  REST is defined by\n&gt; my dissertation.  REST is not defined by the TAG discussion or\n&gt; the W3C&#39;s Webarch document or TimBL&#39;s design notes.  REST is an\n&gt; architectural style, not the Web architecture.  Please try\n&gt; to keep the terminology consistent.\n&gt;\n&gt; REST does not claim that all important resources must have identifiers.\n&gt; REST merely requires that actions be applied to an identified resource,\n&gt; and that identification be in the form of a resource identifier (rather\n&gt; than, for example, a sequence of events).  Obviously, if you do not\n&gt; have an identifier for a given resource, then you cannot interact\n&gt; with it directly in REST, which means you can&#39;t do things like share\n&gt; that specific resource with others or use the URI alone as some form\n&gt; of audit reference (you can&#39;t do that anyway -- you need all of the\n&gt; information that typically gets stored in a logfile, including time,\n&gt; method, authentication token, etc.).\n&gt;\n&gt; That does not in any way imply that all resources are direct or,\n&gt; conversely, that you cannot have an effect on resources via indirect\n&gt; actions under the control of the origin server.  Yes, there are\n&gt; trade-offs between the two, and I personally prefer that multi-valued\n&gt; resource identifiers always result in a redirection to the more\n&gt; specific resource before further actions take place, but both are\n&gt; fully equal parts of the REST model.  They allow interaction to be\n&gt; vague when specificity is neither desired nor needed, and particularly\n&gt; when a component has yet to determine the specific URI.\n&gt;\n&gt; ....Roy\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
