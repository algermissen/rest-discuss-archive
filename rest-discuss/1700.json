What is wrong with a\nPUT\n&gt; containing a representation of the state the user agent wants changed, in\n&gt; this case just the links it does want? For example, could the PUT contain\na\n&gt; Content-Model header &#39;Attachments&#39; that told the server that this is the\n&gt; only state it wanted to change, all the other state can remain the same?\nMainly caching - if the next request (by a different client maybe) does a\nGET on the same URI, a cache could return the last PUT against that URI that\nis saw. Even if the Accept header said &quot;text/html&quot; the cache isn&#39;t required\nto fail with a &#39;content type not available&#39; response.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I am slowly(!) coming to the realization that although REST portrays\nitself\n&gt; as being based on existing and long-standing (in web terms) standards, it\n&gt; really is only based on a small number of very low-level standards (HTTP,\n&gt; URI, etc) and anything else that is needed to build systems based on its&#39;\n&gt; principles requires the definition of your own standards or at least the\nuse\n&gt; of a standardized approach as defined by the few REST gurus, i.e.\n&gt; asynchronous notifications, reliable delivery , security,  authentication,\n&gt; authorization, orchestration, message payloads, etc. most of which appear\nto\n&gt; have yet to be used in anger in systems of any note.\nI agree with you. I would like to be able to download a fully REST-able\nadapter for SQL databases, or LDAP systems, or whatever. But that past few\nyears have been spent on the &#39;visual web&#39; and the types of automation we\nwant - with security, interoperability, multiple document types, pub/sub\nevents - is the next phase. But it will take work.\n\nREST is a set of low-level architectural principles - the implementation of\nthe Web is based on only a small number of standardized technologies -\nbecause only a small number of technologies /could/ be standardized.\nThe security/authentication/authorization part has the most chance of being\nstandardized - but the Browser Wars left a mess of security due to the\nfailure of HTTP to address the needs of UI based applications. HTTP\nstandardizes identification - there is a header for it - but the mechanism\nfor /verifying/ that identity is still implementation dependent & I believe\nit has to be.\nWhat the &quot;REST crowd&quot; would like to see is awareness within the industry,\ninterest from designers and developers and new ground uncovered in the areas\n(and others) that you describe. Now that it is easier to look upon the Web\nfrom a &#39;big picture&#39; point of view, we can see more clearly where to go\nnext.\n\n\n\n"}}
