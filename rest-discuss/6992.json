AIUI though, DHH has fixed this in the new version of Rails. He\n&gt; &gt; understands the problems of the old approach.\n&gt; \n&gt; DHH understood it before accelerators shipped. It&#39;s in big letters in \n&gt; the original Rails book (the only bigger letters are on the cover).\n\nIIRC, that book was still being written when the first GWA fiasco hit.\nI think the chapter on dangerous GET/POST use was the result of it. In\nfact, Rails as a whole seemed to begin a sharp turn toward embracing\nthe constraints laid down by HTTP almost immediately after that.\n\nGWA has to be one of the most important educational events in recent\nweb history. I remember having a long debate with DHH and Simon\nWillison shortly after the first wave of Tada items got deleted :) I\nargued heavily from the web arch side and tried to give examples of\nhow proxy/spider type systems like GWA should be encouraged. They\nboth had a good understanding of the letter of the law as laid out by\nRFC 2616 but that doesn&#39;t provide a whole lot of solace when you have\ncustomers pissed because their stuff is being randomly deleted. To\nthis day I don&#39;t completely buy in to our own BS on that matter. The\nweb is a living thing - you have to consider the formal constraints of\nthe specifications but you&#39;re fooling yourself if you think you can\ndisregard the constraints created by the way the web has evolved on\nits own.\n\n&gt; Which I&#39;ll confees left me somewhat mystified at the outrage by the \n&gt; Rails community.\n\nWell, a lot of that is echo chamber. Rails has a fairly large one.\nFortunately, there seems to be more good practice being echoed than\nbad but in this case I think everyone was wrong.\n\n--\nRyan Tomayko\nhttp://naeblis.cx/\n\n"}}
