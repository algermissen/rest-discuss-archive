REST is=\r\n\nabout directing the flow of the web&#39;s applications, LD is about\nestablishi=\r\nng a structure to the web&#39;s data.\n\nOne important LD-related technology is R=\r\nDF, although it&#39;s not the only\nway to do LD it does seem to have unearthed =\r\nsome of the fundamental\ndifferences between LD and REST, so I&#39;ll share my p=\r\nerspective on that:\n\nRDF, in the quest for web-intelligibility, does not se=\r\nem to cope very\nwell with the ambiguous and messy reality of The Web. This =\r\nhas led to\na lot of controversy and demands from the RDF community for solu=\r\ntions\nto problems that apparently don&#39;t exist for REST or anyone else\noutsi=\r\nde of &#39;RDF land&#39; - a good example of a this is range-14.
