Suppose the\n&gt; following:\n\ni really like this model.  i think the crux of the matter is that there\nare really two resources involved in the purchase order scenario.\ncompanyA looks at its order as a purchase order, and companyB looks at\nthe same order as a /sales/ order.\n\nafter all companyB could in turn be purchasing from companyC, in which\ncase its resource would be a purchase order rather than a sales order.\nthe point here is that in general, companys purchase stuff and they sell\nstuff.  they have different ordering systems for the two scenarios\nbecause different rules and semantics apply in the business protocol.\n\ni really like this model because i think it reflects the reality of\ncompany buying and selling better.  there is clear delineation of which\nresources exist, and who owns them.\n\nas an aside, this is pretty the much the first time i have seen POST\nused just to send a resource a URI rather than a full representation of\nthe resource.  how does this fit into the semantics of HTTP?  should the\nURI be in a header, with /no/ representation in the POST body?  this\nalso raises another issue; now the issuer needs to &#39;own&#39; a HTTP server\nwhere they didn&#39;t before.\n\none more point: because there are more resources involved i think it may\ntake a while longer to &#39;grok&#39; this resource model if you were trying to\nexplain it to somebody.  from a pedagogical perspective, i think maybe\nit would be better to show a simpler version first, point out the\nambiguity, and then show this as a &#39;refinement&#39; of the simpler one.\n\neither way, thanks for sharing the model; it&#39;s certainly food for thought.\n\nthanks,\n-vincent\n\n\n"}}
