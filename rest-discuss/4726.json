Any insight\n&gt; here would be most helpful.\nWhen using PUT, the client application knows and identifies the resource\nthat is to be replaced by the content in the request. Whether the server\ncreates or updates a resource is immaterial - after the request succeeds,\nthe identified resource simply just has the specified state.\nWhen using POST, the server is in control of whether the resource specified\nin the request is modified or whether a new resource is created - and the\nclient can&#39;t guess at what the ID of new resource might be, it needs to be\nprovided by the server in the response. If the response fails to arrive at\nthe client, it might not be safe for the client application to simply\nre-submit the request.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) The writings seem to direct one away from using the query string as\n&gt; much as possible.  While it is clear that .../somecgi.pl?action=delete\n&gt; is most unREST-ful I assume\nOne reason this is unsafe is that a client that does a GET on that resource\nwill cause the resource to suddenly disappear. You often see this in email\nconfirmation messages that have a &#39;click here to unsubscribe&#39; or something.\nAn email user agent that automatically fetched the links in an email would\nsilently cause actions to happen that you didn&#39;t intend (and are not liable\nfor).\n\n&gt; 4) I&#39;m unclear as how a PUT works.  If we take PUT to mean &quot;update&quot;\n&gt; the resource, does one simply send the updated representation of the\n&gt; resource in a PUT request to the server?\nThe meaning of PUT is more similar to an UPSERT (update or insert) operation\nsupported by some RDBMS systems.\nThe client application does indeed simply send a representation of the new\nstate of the resource.\n\n"}}
