It&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; only a hint, it&#39;s not a request.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; that&#39;s the problem..when RESTie meets The Browser. :P\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I think you&#39;re overestimating the role of the browser in REST.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; REST is a set of strictures for the creation of webservices.\n&gt;&gt; It&#39;s primary competitor is SOAP. You don&#39;t write browser webapps\n&gt;&gt; with SOAP. You shouldn&#39;t feel constrained to write browser\n&gt;&gt; webapps with REST.\n&gt;\n&gt; AAAaaarrrggghhh!!\n&gt;\n&gt; Any time your understanding of REST disagrees with your\n&gt; understanding of how the Web works, one or the other is *wrong*.\n\nI&#39;m not sure if you mean this as a personal insult or as a general\nstatement.\n\nIf it&#39;s a personal insult then fine.\n\n\nBut if it&#39;s a general statement then it&#39;s not quite true is it?\n\nFor example, the web works with cookies quite a lot. But cookies are\nnot RESTfull.\n\n\n&gt; Want to offer the user multiple representations? Go ahead and give\n&gt; each one a different extension. Why not? \n\nBecause cool-uris don&#39;t change:\n\n\n&gt; It helps the user understand what they&#39;re getting, besides the fact\n&gt; that it just works. Even if you&#39;re using &lt;link rel=alternate&gt;, you\n&gt; need to give a distinct URI for each representation so the browser\n&gt; can actually grab what the user asked for.\n\nErr... no. As discussed you can use the Accept header to identify\nwhich resource you want.\n\n\n&gt; Content negotiation is not for parameterizing a request in order\n&gt; to get specific versions of a document. Parameters intended to\n&gt; explicitly request a specific thing should go in the URI (for\n&gt; example, as a &quot;.xxx&quot; extension on the &quot;filename&quot;). If I desire a\n&gt; PDF rendition of my bank statement, that&#39;s a specific resource\n&gt; that I care about. I don&#39;t want HTML; that would be a different\n&gt; resource. If, on the other hand, I merely desire my bank\n&gt; statement, and I don&#39;t care what specific file format it comes in,\n&gt; I&#39;m happy if my browser and the server conspire to give me the\n&gt; best representation that they both support, which is exactly what\n&gt; content negotiation is all about.\n\nI don&#39;t understand your argument - surely the situation is exactly the\nopposite? Content negotiation is for selecting the representation of\nthe document that the client wants to see. URIs should identify\nresources, NOT representations of resources.\n\nAs long as they really are the same resource.\n\n\nNic\n\n\n"}}
