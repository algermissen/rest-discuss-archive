However, that doesn&#39;t mean it is &quot;okay&quot;, because\ndoing so makes the URI worthless for later reference (infinite URIs\ndue to session id being in the URI).  The set of URIs can be reduced\nto a more natural, finite set by inserting the user id instead.\nBetter yet, when possible, avoid placing temporary state on the\nserver and thus keep the URI free of any user state information.\nThat is easy to do for new architectures -- much harder when dealing\nwith legacy browsers.\n\nIn any case, the problem with cookies in the header is *not* that\nthey violate statelessness, but rather that they violate visibility\n(because nobody knows why they are there) and reliability (because\nthey are associated with the site rather than the current state of\nthe user&#39;s interface).  A message containing cookie headers is still\nstateless, assuming that the cookie isn&#39;t specified relative to\nsome prior state (which would be very weird).\n\n&gt; But a serious question.  You say:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; They [session cookies w/ URI syntax session keys and persisted state] \n&gt;&gt; satisfy the stateless constraint, but they lose by\n&gt;&gt; creating an infinite resource space.\n&gt;\n&gt; Not challenging the assertion at all, but looking for a bit more \n&gt; clarity in the abstract.  Sounds like there might be one of those \n&gt; mind-blowing gestalts lurking here.  I&#39;d really like to understand:\n&gt;\n&gt; (1)  What you mean by an infinite resource space...\n&gt; (2)  How it is that (session) cookies create an infinite resource \n&gt; space...\n\nI meant session cookies placed within the URI.\n\n&gt; (3)  Why an infinite resource space is a bad thing...\n\nAt any instant in time, the web consists of a space of nodes defined\nby all referenced resources (resources with defined URI).  If some part\nof the URI corresponds to a random id, then that space is effectively\ninfinite and short-lived, which in turn means that people can&#39;t share\nthose resources even when they are equivalent.\n\nMetcalfe&#39;s Law refers to the value of a network of connected nodes.\nWhen two or more URI exist for the same resource, that resource&#39;s\nconnected neighbors are partitioned among them.  In effect, the\nWeb reaches a point of disjunction rather than conjunction, which\naffects the value of the neighbor relations.  Hmmm, just a minute...\ngoogling...I knew there would be a theory somewhere:\n\n    &lt;http://powerlaws.media.mit.edu/&gt;\n\nThat looks like a valuable resource.\n\n&gt; PS - Roy, since you went to all the trouble to get gbiv.com, why do \n&gt; you go by fielding@... when clearly roy@gbiv is the intended and \n&gt; admirably-groanable pun? :-)\n\nBecause, when I tried that, I quickly found out that some portion of\nthe Internet has been using that address in the same way as Mickey Mouse\nfor those marketing sites that demand a non-verified e-mail address.\nSo much for my grand plan to reduce typing by grabbing a four-letter\ndomain.  I decided it would be better to reject that address, at least\nfor a few more years.  The pun still works for my personal home page.\n\nActually, it isn&#39;t a pun -- G. Biv is my basketball nickname from\nthe dorms at UCI.\n\n....Roy    &lt;http://roy.gbiv.com/&gt;\n\n\n"}}
