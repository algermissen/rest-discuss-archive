The client does not need a priori\nknowledge of the server URI space. It constructs (some parts of)\na URI, but:\n\nIt does so based on directions provided to it within a\nrepresentation returned from the server (and according to the\nrules for query strings).\n\nTherefore, this is still representational state transfer. This is\nwhat Roy’s recent message boils down to:\n\n* Roy T. Fielding &lt;fielding@...&gt; [2007-05-10 18:00]:\n&gt; It is essential to eliminate the coupling between client and\n&gt; server. If the application doesn&#39;t follow the workflow defined\n&gt; by the representations that are received, then the application\n&gt; isn&#39;t using the REST style. Not even a little bit. It is using\n&gt; RPC plus streaming, with a rather inefficient syntax, and the\n&gt; client will break each time the server&#39;s application evolves\n&gt; because the client must be anticipating the server&#39;s state\n&gt; based on its own assumptions. In other words, the two are\n&gt; coupled by their original design.\n\nIn a sense, forms are just a compression scheme. They can be used\nto express an infinite amount of links with a single description\nthat encompasses all of them. But representational state transfer\nis still happening because such a manifold link must still be\nprovided by the server to the client inside a representation.\n\nLikewise, having the client construct URIs in general would be\nOK, if this was happening based on a URI Template enclosed in a\nrepresentation previously retrieved by the client. It is _not_ OK\nif it happens based on a priori knowledge of the client about the\nserver URI space, because then the client is coupled to the\nserver.\n\n\n[^1] But I agree that I didn’t sufficiently qualify my previous\n     post to sufficiently cover forms.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
