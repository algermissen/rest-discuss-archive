I can see how this covers the \n&gt; case I gave in my example. But there are two possible \n&gt; generalizations which I can&#39;t quite make the leap to:\n&gt; \n&gt; A) There are N possible combinations of things to set \n&gt; color-combo state on. So I guess you need to generate that \n&gt; part of the URL. \n\nYes, using URI template syntax:\n\n\thttp://example.com/color-combos/{color1}-and-{color2}/\n\n&gt; B) What if there are multiple attributes being swapped? \n&gt; color, height, location, etc.? Am I going to generate that \n&gt; part of the URL too? \n&gt; http://example.com/color-height-location-combos/a-and-b-and-c\n\nSure, if you need that.  But I think maybe you should look at it like this:\n\n\thttp://example.com/{item1}-and-{item2}/\n\nWhere you upload the entire item1 and item2 vs. just their colors.  And if\nyou need more:\n\n\thttp://example.com/{item1}-and-{item2}-and-{item3}/\n\nThough I&#39;m not sure what the swapping logic would be here.\n\nAlternately you could look at using transactions like covered in the RESTful\nWeb Services book.\n\n&gt; &gt; Note that any state that you need can simply be modeled as \n&gt; a URL that \n&gt; &gt; represents that state.\n&gt; \n&gt; I thought what was in the URL was resources, and you would \n&gt; interact with the state of those resources. Which is what \n&gt; your example URL (3) looks like it is doing.  &quot;color-combos&quot; \n&gt; is a resource, and &quot;a-and-b&quot;\n&gt; is sub-resource under that.\n\nNot sure of what you are asking, but I can say that there is no\n&quot;sub-resource&quot;, there is only one resource per one URL. The form the URL\ntakes is up to you for your own convenience in modeling your system.  You\ncould just as RESTfully have URLs like the following although good luck\ntrying to comprehend it all:\n\nhttp://example.com/000001\nhttp://example.com/000002\nhttp://example.com/000003\n...\n\nFYI the concept of a resource is just an abstraction and trying to\nexplicitly define what the term resource actually means, therein lies\nmadness. &#39;-) \n\nHTH\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org - http://t.oolicio.us\n\n\n"}}
