Sounds reasonable to me, b=\r\nut maybe it&#39;s bad for reasons I haven&#39;t thought of.

On=\r\ne is to have the cancel state as part of the order. \n&gt; THen I can just put =\r\na new representation with the cancelled state set to \n&gt; true:\n&gt; \n&gt; PUT /ord=\r\ners/333\n&gt; content-type: application/xml\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;order id=3D&quot;333&quot;&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;canc=\r\nelled&gt;false&lt;/cancelled&gt;\n&gt; ...\n&gt; &lt;/order&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Seems kinda heavy to me.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Would it still be restful to define a &quot;cancelled&quot; URI that you could put \n=\r\n&gt; or post to to change the state?\n&gt; \n&gt; /orders/333/cancelled\n&gt; \n&gt; or\n&gt; \n&gt; /=\r\norders/333?cancel=3Dtrue\n&gt; \n&gt; You don&#39;t even need to send data to change th=\r\ne state in this scenario. \n&gt; But the problem with this from a pure RESTful =\r\nstandpoint is, isn&#39;t this \n&gt; a mini-RPC?  My thought at first is YES IT IS.=\r\n...\n&gt; \n&gt; .... But, consider if you have cancelling as part of a HATEOAS\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &lt;order id=3D&quot;333&quot;&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;atom:link rel=3D&quot;CANCEL&quot; href=3D&quot;http://example=\r\n.com/orders/333/cancelled&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;     ...\n&gt; &lt;/order&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Now, I have a CAN=\r\nCEL link that if I follow changes the state of my \n&gt; resource.  Doesn&#39;t see=\r\nm so RPCish now that I&#39;ve embedded it as a link. \n&gt; Maybe the answer is /or=\r\nders/333/cancelled isn&#39;t very RESTful by itself, \n&gt; but when combined with =\r\nHATEOAS it is?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Bill Burke\n&gt; JBoss, a division of Red Hat\n&gt;=\r\n http://bill.burkecentral.com\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
