FWIW I \nwholeheartedly agree that not only is HTML a rational choice, but a very \ngood choice for a RESTful system.\n\n&gt;&gt; No one is actively encouraging what the spec discourages - instead,\n&gt;&gt; we&#39;re saying that if you know what you&#39;re doing and there is shared\n&gt;&gt; understanding on all participants, it&#39;s ok.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I wish that&#39;s what folks were saying, then I&#39;d have made my point.\n&gt; But, every time I point out that opaque identifiers fail to meet the\n&gt; self-descriptive messaging constraint, I&#39;m shouted down by those who\n&gt; refuse to believe that any tradeoffs exist when they&#39;re used -- I have\n&gt; to agree with Roy, that if you&#39;re going into that decision with your\n&gt; eyes wide open, fine.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, when folks refuse to admit, and actively shout down those who\n&gt; point out, that there is a tradeoff, how can those reading their advice\n&gt; be making an informed, eyes-wide-open decision?  That&#39;s what I mean by\n&gt; &quot;cavalier&quot; -- it *does* make a difference, and not a trivial one,\n&gt; either.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the Web, &quot;participant&quot; includes the entire deployed infrastrucute,\n&gt; not just sender and recipient.  If you stick to ubiquitous identifiers\n&gt; whose processing rules have long been understood by the deployed\n&gt; infrastructure, you immediately gain the benefits of REST, which you\n&gt; can&#39;t bank on if the deployed infrastructure simply ignores your\n&gt; content because it&#39;s never encountered your identifier before.\n\nYes, also getting back to the key point here and well worth discussing - \ndiverging in to a pedantic angels on pins discussion about whether a \nmedia type must be registered with IANA is always going to be fruitless. \nAs Mike pointed out, Roy has already discussed this at length:\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/6613\nand this remains why using non registered media types is discouraged, \nand at best can only ever be discouraged (because you need to allow for \nevolution).\n\nYou make some good points here, would be good to see these two \nparticularly discussed further, imho, far more fruitful for everyone \ninvolved to get some community agreement on &#39;best-practise&#39; hearing all \nsides for and against :)\n\nBest,\n\nNathan\n\nps: sorry for changing the subject line, but hopefully it&#39;ll refresh the \nconversation to positives.\n\n"}}
