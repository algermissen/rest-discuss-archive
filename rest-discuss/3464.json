How do\n&gt; you go about, in a RESTful manner, returning different representations of\n&gt; the same resource when those representations have the same content-type?\n&gt; Admittedly, this is not a common case these days, but I think such a\n&gt; scenario will become more frequent.\n&gt;\n&gt; As mentioned in a couple posts, a common technique is to use a query string\n&gt; to distinquish.  Another technique is to treat the variants as a sort of\n&gt; sub-resource.  Both of these techniques have their advantages and\n&gt; disadvantages.  However, the one disadvantage they both have is that they\n&gt; are in no way standardized across implementations.  For instance, Jeff Bone,\n&gt; Joe Gregorio, and I use different query strings for serving up RSS.\n&gt;\n&gt; One of the nice things about MIME types is that they are &quot;standardized&quot;,\n&gt; hence the Accept header.  But that is course-grained.  For instance, there\n&gt; is no way using Accept: to indicate whether the client wants to receive RSS\n&gt; 0.91 or RSS 2.0.  Sure, we could register more and more content-types, but\n&gt; that seems like a nightmare (though I gather some work is being done to\n&gt; address such a problem).\n&gt;\n&gt; So what is a RESTful app to do?\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt; seairth@...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
