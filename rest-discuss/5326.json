For example, the components  \ndiscover at runtime where to send the RDF data they produce as  \nopposed to hardcoding that into them (an obvious thing to do, of  \ncourse).\n\nTo protect the clients from changes made to the domain model (e.g.  \ninstead of saying foo:hostX ex:IPAdddress &quot;168.192.56.78&quot; we might  \nwant to say foo:hostX ex:hasPart foo:hostX/eth0  and  foo:hostX/eth0  \nex:IPAddress &quot;168.192.56.78&quot;) I think about taking the code that  \ncreates the RDF data out of the distributed components and sending it  \nat runtime as code-on-demand. When the domain model changes I&#39;d only  \nneed to change the code in one place without affecting the components  \nat all. they&#39;d just execute whatever they receive.\n\nIs that an appropriate use of the code-on-demand style or is that  \ntaking it to the extreme?\n\nHow does one decide where to draw the line? The extreme would be a  \ncomponent that downloads itself almost completely at runtime (modulo  \nthe HTTP implementation).\n\nThanks for any thoughts.\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
