So I want to make sure *I* \nhave this right.  Going back to [2], Microsoft&#39;s example uses:\n\n &quot;&lt;IsDefault&gt;TrueFalse&lt;/IsDefault&gt;&quot;\n\nLet&#39;s say the first example on [2] is a PUT instead of a POST.  Since it \nincludes no &lt;IsDefault&gt; elements in the submission body, the server MAY \nadd those elements and set their values.  So a subsequent GET would \nretrieve a different representation than what was PUT. Nothing wrong with \nthat, right?\n\nIn the second example on [2], change the request like so:\n\nPUT (not POST) /livecontacts/contacts/contact(ContactID)/emails HTTP/1.1\n\n&lt;Emails&gt;\n&lt;Email&gt;\n &lt;EmailType&gt;EmailType&lt;EmailType&gt;\n &lt;IsDefault&gt;TrueFalse&lt;/IsDefault&gt;\n &lt;Address&gt;EmailAddress&lt;/Address&gt;\n&lt;/Email&gt;\n&lt;Email&gt;\n &lt;EmailType&gt;EmailType&lt;/EmailType&gt; \n &lt;Address&gt;EmailAddress&lt;/Address&gt;\n&lt;/Email&gt;\n&lt;/Emails&gt;\n\nThe server MAY interpret that as intended, which is a change to the \n&quot;default status&quot; of the first &lt;Email&gt;.  If the server assigned an \n&lt;IsDefault&gt; to the second &lt;Email&gt;, its removal on this PUT could \nreasonably be interpreted as &quot;no change&quot;.  On a subsequent GET, the \n&lt;IsDefault&gt; child of the second &lt;Email&gt; may still appear, unchanged.\n\nWithout the second &lt;Email&gt; element in the submission body, the server \nSHOULD interpret the PUT as a change in the default status of the first \n&lt;Email&gt; AND a removal of the second &lt;Email&gt;.  Obviously, if the second \n&lt;Email&gt; is removed leaving only one in the list, and the PUT attempts \nto set &lt;IsDefault&gt;False&lt;/IsDefault&gt; on the first &lt;Email&gt;, then the \nserver should be free to set &lt;IsDefault&gt;True&lt;/IsDefault&gt; and override \nthe client&#39;s attempt to break the server logic, right?\n\nIf I&#39;m on the right track, that would mean Microsoft&#39;s error in [1] \nis not removing elements omitted from a PUT.  But I have just shown a \nperfectly reasonable (I think) use case showing just that.  I am \nunable to articluate the difference between my understanding of PUT \nand what appears to be a mistake in Microsoft&#39;s implementation.\n\nAnyone?\n\n-Eric\n\n[1] http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb447763.aspx\n[2] http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb463980.aspx\n\n\n\n"}}
