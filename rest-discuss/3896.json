If you are defining different meanings for these meth=\r\nods you \nare violating HTTP.

I have to admit that i don&#39;t really\n&gt;&gt; &gt; understand. You have to de=\r\nfine a format that is suitable for any kind\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of application. This look =\r\nquite ambitious. You can use RDF to help the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; representation to be self=\r\n descriptive, but you still have to define (ou\n&gt;&gt; &gt; refine) and RDFS. From =\r\nan other pov, your proposal looks like wsdl (as\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Bill? said).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; See=\r\n my comments on taking HTTP seriously in the other thread.\n&gt;&gt; Earlier, you =\r\ndefined an inbox index format.  I am saying that is enough\n&gt;&gt; to  define yo=\r\nur entire application from the client&#39;s perspective.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If the server re=\r\nturns an index in response to a GET without an Accept\n&gt;&gt; header, the resour=\r\nce is an index and NOT a container.  That means the\n&gt;&gt; semantics of POST  s=\r\nhould be with respect to that index and not a\n&gt;&gt; container.  In other words=\r\n, if the resource IS an index, then POST means\n&gt;&gt; add an entry to the index=\r\n and NOT add a message to a container; messages\n&gt;&gt; must be stored somewhere=\r\n else a la DJ Bernstein.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If the server returns a container in respons=\r\ne to a GET without an Accept\n&gt;&gt; header, the resource is a container and not=\r\n an index.  That means the\n&gt;&gt; semantics of POST should be with respect to t=\r\nhe container and not an\n&gt;&gt; index.  In other words, if the resource is a con=\r\ntainer, then POST means\n&gt;&gt; add a  message to the container and can at your =\r\noption affect an index.\n&gt;&gt; Messages  are stored in the container  a la SMTP=\r\n.  Note, nothing\n&gt;&gt; constrains the  server from providing an index in respo=\r\nnse to a GET with\n&gt;&gt; a an &quot;Accept:  text/x-yannick-index&quot;, but that is real=\r\nly beside the\n&gt;&gt; point.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an e=\r\nmail to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yah=\r\noo!
