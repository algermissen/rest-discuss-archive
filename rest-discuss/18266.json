At least some of this\nbehavior within the sof=\r\ntware industry is due to a lack of\nunderstanding of why a given set of arch=\r\nitectural constraints is\nuseful. In other words, the reasoning behind good =\r\nsoftware\narchitectures is not apparent to designers when those architecture=\r\ns\nare selected for reuse.&quot;[4]\n\nBest of luck in 2012\n\n[1] http://www.ics.uci=\r\n.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/net_app_arch.htm#sec_2_3\n[2] http://www.ic=\r\ns.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/web_arch_domain.htm#sec_4_3\n[3] http:=\r\n//www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/net_arch_styles.htm#sec_3_1\n[=\r\n4] http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/introduction.htm\n\n\nOn=\r\n Fri, Dec 30, 2011 at 17:22, Jorn Wildt &lt;jw@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Havin=\r\ng said this doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that I agree 100% with it myself.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nWhat if I do not expect my application to live for decades?
