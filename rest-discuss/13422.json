They have a system, usually not\nbuilt thi=\r\nnking on REST, and they want an API created. They usually think\nREST is an =\r\nAPI making technique or recipe, for the web.\nSubcategories:\n  - URI Juggler=\r\ns. This are the ones that think REST is all about creating\nURIs, and nothin=\r\ng more. So their discussions are solely focused on URIs,\nand their presenta=\r\ntions are about URIs definitions.\n  - RPCers. Bad group that think REST is =\r\na way to map RPC in disguise\nusing URIs in a web API. The most of them don&#39;=\r\nt know they speak RPC at\nall.\n  - Exposers: This type is repeated below. Th=\r\nose are the guys that think\nyou need to expose things in REST using resourc=\r\nes. So REST is an API for\nexposing things on the web.\n  - CRUDers: Another =\r\nrepeated group. They think REST is a web api for\nCRUD. Simple.\n\nMappers: Th=\r\nis other category may use the API idea, but they actually\nthing REST is a r=\r\nepresentation type and the work to be done is to map\nall that is know used =\r\nto that new type. Interesting?\n  - CRUDers. Again, the idea is that CRUD ca=\r\nn be mapped naturally to HTTP\noperations, and that\nmakes it RESTful.\n  - HT=\r\nTPers. They believe REST is HTTP. Deep enough.\n  - Exposers. Again too. The=\r\ny usually try to map all classes, data\nentities, elements into resources, a=\r\nnd then call their systems RESTful.\n\nFAD followers?: This is a group of the=\r\n reminders of the types. Usually,\nthey tend to follow a lead.\n  - Standard =\r\nHaters: Here you have all those that think Standards are\nevil and that REST=\r\n is an anarchy where you have the freedom to do\nwhatever you like, so they =\r\nfollow REST doing whatever they want.\n  - KISS lovers. This are the ones th=\r\nat like thinks to be simple. And\nsomeone told them REST is easy, so they fo=\r\nllow doing easy things with\nURIs. There are lots of URI jugglers in this gr=\r\noup.\n  - Servicers. They think Services is good, and someone told them REST=\r\n is\na way to do services without SOAP. So they follow.\n  - BuzzWorders. Thi=\r\ns is a vast majority. They like buzz words, so they\nfollow REST just becaus=\r\ne it is cool and all people talk about it. There\nare some Buzz creators too=\r\n, with thinks like ROA and REST in WOA. No pun\nintended on REST-*\n\nIs there=\r\n some one I&#39;m missing? Well, yes, probably the group that knows\nREST as it =\r\nactually is and understands it. That may be a one person\ngroup (yes Roy).\n\n=\r\nI&#39;m may not be saying all those believes up there are wrong. I&#39;m NOT\nsaying=\r\n they are good, at all.\n\nWhat do you think?
