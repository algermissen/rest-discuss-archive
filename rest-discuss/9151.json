Heintz wrote:\n\n&gt; There is nothing JSON does that XML can&#39;t (what is the data equivalent\n&gt; of Turing Complete?), but JSON is much less costly (verbosity,\n&gt; programming weight) than XML for those things.\n\n\nAn interesting question. I suspect that it&#39;s very hard to come up with a \nlanguage that isn&#39;t &quot;information complete&quot;. Essentially if you have at \nleast two states and an infinite space, anything can be encoded. I \nsuspect the only languages that are not &quot;information complete&quot; would be \nones with a finite number of strings.\n\nHowever just as Intercal is not an appropriate replacement for C, and \nC++ is not an appropriate replacement for Java, there are practical \nconsiderations beyond theoretical expressiveness that come into play \nwhen choosing one&#39;s languages. The information space that JSON handles \nwell is large, but it is not nearly as large as the information space of \nthe Web. Structured data is a crutch invented by computer scientists \nbecause they don&#39;t have computers as powerful as a human brain. Tables, \nmaps, list, trees and more are all kludges designed to try to make some \nsense out of an unordered, unstructured world.\n\nXML and its tree structures are not a perfect representation of human \nknowledge and the information we need to encode. However, precisely \nbecause XML is less structured than maps and lists and tables, it can \nhandle more information than can be encoded in maps and lists and \ntables. There are many, many examples where JSON (and other map-list \ndata structures) becomes practically unmanageable but which XML handles \nwithout blinking.  However it&#39;s not a two-way street. XML cannot only \nencode everything JSON can encode. It can do so practically, usefully, \nand efficiently. The reverse is not true.\n\nI hope one day soon there will be still less structured, more generic \ninformation description languages that can well handle the information \nstructures XML cannot.\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
