It would\nmake sense to use a class per resource type, with\nmethods for the HTTP methods, i.e. GET, POST, etc.\n\n&gt; The method will return\n&gt; XML data that will link to more data (individual\n&gt; Credit Applications)\n\nGood.\n\n&gt; Is this correct ? Are a CreditApplication and a\n&gt; CreditApplicationCollection different resources ?\n&gt; (different business objects ??)\n\nThis is a good approach. One of the things I don&#39;t\nlike about MVC web frameworks (like Rails) is how\nthey encourage you to use one controller for both\nthe collection and the resources it contains. I\nthink it makes sense to split them apart.\n\n&gt; Would greatly appreciate it if somebody could very\n&gt; briefly explain the flow / sequence for an actual J2EE\n&gt; implementation using J2EE pattern terminology (Front\n&gt; Controller, Web Service Broker, Business Delegate,\n&gt; Session Facade, Business Object ???. \n\n&gt; Which J2EE patterns are applicable for a REST\n&gt; implementation ?\n\nNone of them... I guess you could call the dispatcher\na Front Controller if you want.\n\nDon&#39;t get hung up on J2EE and patterns, you can get\neverything you want done with just a servlet and some\nPOJOs.\n\n"}}
