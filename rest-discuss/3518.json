Is anyone\n&gt; working on a ReST Oriented Programming Environments?\n\nNot as such to the best of my knowledge.\n\nBut if you squint really hard, you might notice that REST has an awful \nlot in common with the programming model implicit in the pi-calculus \n... the key point is to think of a URI in REST corresponding to the \nname of a communication channel in pi.\n\nI think the most interesting aspect of the comparison is that REST&#39;s \nmost powerful idiom (passing continuation/capability URIs in \nrequest/response entities) carries over directly to pi (names of \nchannels can be passed over channels).\n\nThere are a few experimental programming languages modelled on pi which \nyou might enjoy playing with. They might also be a source of \ninspiration for anyone interested in putting together a full-blown REST \ntoolkit. PICT and Nomadic PICT are probably the most interesting ... \nimplementations for Linux available here,\n\n  http://lsewww.epfl.ch/~pawel/nomadicpict.html\n\nCheers,\n\n\nMiles\n\n"}}
