To imply that working according to these abstract\n&gt;principles means one cannot &quot;get work done in the real world&quot; is just\nplain\n&gt;wrong.  That would  be equatable to saying you don&#39;t care much about\ndesign\n&gt;patterns in programming becuase you need to get work done in the real\n&gt;world.\n\nI don&#39;t mean to imply that working according to those abstract design\nprinciples means you can&#39;t get work done in the real world - I&#39;m just\ntrying (poorly?) to put myself in the shoes of the developers of non\nRESTful web infrastructures. In the case of jakarta struts, I don&#39;t know\nthat the position is entirely indefensible. Would the developers get more\npayoff from refactoring struts to adhere to REST design principles, or\nfrom, I dunno, adding some new whizbang feature? Probably the latter, at\nleast from the point of view of their employers.\n\n- donald\n\n\n"}}
