He spent quite a bit of\n&gt; time talking about how it wasn&#39;t at all clear that &quot;stretching RPC out\n&gt; to internet scale&quot; would work, and how a potentially much better\n&gt; approach would be to shrink messaging down to work &quot;in the small&quot;.\n\nThat sounds to me like: &quot;We tried to force one non-Internet model onto\nthe Internet and it didn&#39;t work. Now we&#39;re about to try to force another\nnon-Internet model onto the Internet. Maybe that will work. Oh, and by\nthe way, that protocol that is the basis for most of the Internet&#39;s most\nsophisticated applications? Let&#39;s kill that.&quot;\n\n&gt; According to him, the issue there is the programming model, which is\n&gt; what he said he&#39;s working on at Microsoft.\n\nPeople have spent the last five years adopting to the Web&#39;s programming\nmodel, inconvenient as it is.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
