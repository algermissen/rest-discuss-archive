This\nrequires a lot of engi=\r\nneering and thoughts in how to design those, including\nhow the interaction =\r\ncan be driven by the server and how the links are to be\nfollowed, which mak=\r\nes creating them expensive, but hopefully much more\nloosely coupled, reusab=\r\nle and durable.\n\nIf you package the intent and the semantics of an operatio=\r\nn within a message\nand POST to a queue, you may breach many constraints of =\r\nReST in the process,\nwhich is a tradeoff each developer has to evaluate for=\r\n themselves.\n\nMore importantly, by defining multiple messages carrying inte=\r\nnt, you enforce\nthe client to understand those, which is coupling the clien=\r\nt to the details\nof what commands exist, which means the client needs an un=\r\nderstanding of\neach of those commands. I compare that to the case of unders=\r\ntanding the\nmedia type to send a representation, and understanding how to f=\r\nollow links,\nand I&#39;d argue that the latter has lower coupling, with higher =\r\nimplementation\ncost.\n\nSeb\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Greg Young [m=\r\nailto:gregoryyoung1@...] \nSent: 19 May 2009 20:31\nTo: Sebastien Lambl=\r\na\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] CommandQuerySeparation and REST?\n\nYes things =\r\nlike this can be done ...\n\nbut when you start going down this path (everyth=\r\ning becomes actions\nlike these) don&#39;t you really lose much of what you had =\r\nto benefit\nfgrom in the beginning?
