Mainly, caching.  If the \n&gt; session has a URI, it can be cached.  If the session key is in a cookie, \n&gt; the session cannot be cached.  So, I think the way to do it is something \n&gt; like:\n&gt; \n&gt; GET http://www.example.com/basket/12/checkout.html\n\nNo. The concerns of &#39;caching&#39; and &#39;bookmarkability&#39; (&#39;bookmarkability&#39; \nis a word. Promise. ;) are truly independent.\n\nThe way to solve your caching concerns seems to be with ETags (something \nI as yet know little about).\n\nI think your proposed URI design is a bad idea. If I were designing this \napplication I would associate &#39;shopping basket&#39; with the &#39;session&#39; and \nimply it by &#39;session token&#39;. I would not put it in the URL. It&#39;s a bad \nidea. I can&#39;t think how to explain why in less than 50,000 words though, \nbecause it feels like I have to go all the way back to first principles.\n\nI admit that if you deny the possibility of &#39;subject&#39; in the HTTP \nrequest (i.e. you don&#39;t use a session cookie) that this is the only real \nthing you can do. However, I disagree that making such denials is a \nreasonable thing to do.\n\nThere are certainly cases where storing state in the URL like this is \nhighly desirable. A shopping basket is not such a case though.\n\nFor example, say my browser crashes (power failure, accidentally closed, \nbuggy, etc.) and I come back to your web site to finish my shopping. If \nyou had been maintaining the state of my shopping basket on your server, \nthen when I login (or maybe even without logging in), you can say &quot;Here \nare the shopping baskets you&#39;re filling, would you like to pick one of \nthem up and finish shopping?&quot;. You can&#39;t do that if you&#39;re stashing \nsession state in the URL. Also, there only needs to be &#39;one&#39; shopping \nbasket, and such a model would correlate better with reality. This model \nyou propose creates an entirely new basket for each additional item. \nYou&#39;re not doing that because it makes sense. You&#39;re doing that in a \nvain attempt to deny session state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
