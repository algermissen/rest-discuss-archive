WebDAV supports meta data \n&gt;&gt; (properties) on HTTP resources, and *usually* this data is not part of \n&gt;&gt; the representation.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s correct, which is one big reason WebDAV is not RESTful.\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; People *are* organizing resources in hierarchies, and they *do* assign \n&gt;&gt; meta data (properties) to these resources. That use case surely does \n&gt;&gt; not apply to each and every web resource, but it does exist, and \n&gt;&gt; WebDAV makes it possible to do it through HTTP.\n&gt; \n&gt; All that the client sees are URIs. All the client knows are the \n&gt; representations returned by the URIs. It is possible to provide metadata \n&gt; about the resources identified by these URIs. One way to do that is by \n&gt; RDF. (There are many others.) These metadata resources themselves have \n&gt; URIs. This can all be handled through POST, PUT, DELETE, and GET. new \n&gt; verbs like WebDAV&#39;s are not necessary to support metadata.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why do I believe new verbs are unnecessary for this use case? Because I \n&gt; don&#39;t believe in metadata. More specifically, I don&#39;t believe in the \n&gt; distinction between data and metadata. What&#39;s your metadata may be my \n&gt; data and vice versa. Furthermore what&#39;s my metadata today may be my data \n&gt; tomorrow and vice versa. Sometimes I may wish to treat the same resource \n&gt; as data, sometimes as metadata. But if it&#39;s all just data why can&#39;t I \n&gt; just use my data handling methods (PUT, POST, GET, and DELETE) to handle \n&gt; it? Why do I need to a different verb to manipulate the data depending \n&gt; on whether I happen to be treating it as data or metadata this time? The \n&gt; server doesn&#39;t care what I&#39;m going to do with the data after all.\n\nElliotte,\n\nthanks for the clarifications. As a matter of fact, I do agree with most \n  of what you said.\n\nBut, as far as I can tell, there are also lots of disadvantages in a \nsystem that *only* builds on the relations between resources. For instance:\n\n- Granularity: will every property be it&#39;s own resource?\nIf it is, how do I change a set of properties in a single operation?\n\n- Discovery: given the URL of a resource, how do I discover other \nresources that provide data/metadata about this resource?\n\n- Performance: what exactly do I need to do to find out name, content \ntype, length and author of all members of a collection? In WebDAV, \nthat&#39;s one single request.\n\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n"}}
