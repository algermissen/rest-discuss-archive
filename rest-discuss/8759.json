Most apps shouldn&#39;t but some should.\n\nAnd this is where it stops being a client-server constraint and starts \nbeing a client-server service that&#39;s there if you want it but not if you \ndon&#39;t.\n\nThe same is true and should be true for the rest of desktop computing.\n\nCan experience from REST inform desktop computing - yes, though in my \ncase probably too much (I&#39;m if anything biased towards using a method \nthat works on the web since I don&#39;t code for the desktop much).\n\nIs the style directly applicable - I think no.\n\nThis is also true of other web-like matters (I think Mike&#39;s point about \naddress bars is something where the experience of Windows explorer is \nakin to that of the web, but isn&#39;t much related to REST).\n\n\n"}}
