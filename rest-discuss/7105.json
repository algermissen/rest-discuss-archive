Future efforts will involve correcting some existing design\n&gt; &gt; issues, e.g,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://hjb.python-hosting.com/ticket/58#preview\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; and further refining the REST interface.\n&gt;\n&gt; Using POST to retreive messages (as there is a side-effect of doing so)\n&gt; isn&#39;t really a problem, though you might want to provide a URL for the\n&gt; message/resource to the POSTer so they can subsequently GET it (and get\n&gt; the concomitant benefits).  Using GET for things like registering and\n&gt; starting/stopping all these things doesn&#39;t seem great, though.\n&gt;\n\nMessages are never stored by HJB - it acts a pure gateway translating\nrequests into actions in the JMS messaging system.  Once a message is\nretrieved, only the next is available so providing a GET URL is not an\noption.\n\nI could not see any distinct advantage in using either GET or POST for\nstart and stop things.  I decided to go with GET with stop/start/other\noperations, because for nearly all them, re-requesting the URL without\nany other intermediate state changes leaves &#39;system&#39; in the same\nstate.  Although all client interaction with a messaging system is\ninherently transient, these operations &#39;felt&#39; as idempotent within the\nlifetime of any given client - hence the use of GET.\n\n&gt; While the API here makes good use of Location headers in response to\n&gt; POSTs, it seems like there could be a more extensive use of hypermedia.\n&gt; Right now, it appears clients are going to be hard-coded to build urls\n&gt; based on this documentation, rather than through a dialog with the\n&gt; server.\n&gt;\n\nWhat could be done to fix this? E.g., would it be worth adding\nsomething similar to the /list command that shows all the possible\nsub-URLs that can be obtained on any given resource?\n\nE.g. At the moment, there is no action when you try to GET any of the\nactual URIs that represent JMS resources. Or maybe a further sub-url\ncould be added: /commands...\n\n&gt;\n&gt; But that strikes me as true of all of these &quot;REST&quot; APIs ... even if they\n&gt; follow all the constraints, APIs for other software are still APIs that\n&gt; are hard-coded into clients. :/\n&gt;\n\n&gt; --\n&gt; ...jsled\n&gt; http://asynchronous.org/ - `a=jsled; b=asynchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b}`\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
