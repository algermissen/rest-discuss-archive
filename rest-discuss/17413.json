One of our aims is to deploy them as we=\r\nb services, and of course, we want to do that in a RESTful way. That&#39;s why =\r\nI&#39;d love to have your opinion.\n\nSimple example: a service which takes a pho=\r\ntograph as input, and outputs the detected faces.\nThe input could be &quot;http:=\r\n//example.org/images/people&quot; (a JPEG image) and the output &quot;one face in the=\r\n rectangle 204,36,10,10 and another in the rectangle 38,56,12,12&quot;.\n\nA very =\r\ncool way would of course be to just GET http://example.org/images/people/fa=\r\nces, which then returns an RDF list.\nAnd even HTTP Link headers to http://e=\r\nxample.org/images/people/faces/1 and http://example.org/images/people/faces=\r\n/2.\nOr maybe HTTP link headers to http://example.org/images/people#xywh=3D2=\r\n04,36,10,10 (see [1]) with a rel of &quot;http://ontology.org/face&quot;.\nUnfortunate=\r\nly, we assume http://example.org does not know how to detect faces.\n\nSo, th=\r\nere is this face detection service at http://other.com/. How to invoke it?\n=\r\nGETting http://other.org/detectfaces/http://images/people does not seem al =\r\nthat nice, since that is totally not resource oriented.\nWe could first POST=\r\n the image to http://other.org/images and then access the face detection se=\r\nrvice by GETting http://other.org/images/34/faces.\nHowever, this involves t=\r\nwo calls to other.org.\n\nThose where basically my ideas. Do you have any ide=\r\nas that could shed a light on this?\nThanks in advance!\n\n[1] http://www.w3.o=\r\nrg/TR/media-frags/\n\nCheers,\n\nRuben Verborgh\n--\nGhent University - IBBT\nFacu=\r\nlty of Engineering and Architecture\nDepartment of Electronics and Informati=\r\non Systems (ELIS)\nMultimedia Lab\nGaston Crommenlaan 8 bus 201\nB-9050 Ledebe=\r\nrg-Ghent\nBelgium\n\nt: +32 9 33 14959\nf: +32 9 33 14896\nt secr: +32 9 33 1491=\r\n1\ne: ruben.verborgh@...\n\nURL: http://multimedialab.elis.ugent.be\n\n\n"}}
