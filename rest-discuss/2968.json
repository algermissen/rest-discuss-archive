Why introduce an extra layer of &quot;pass the object \nidentifer as the first parameter&quot;? Do you realize that this means that \nrahter than passing around opaque pointers to account objects (URIs in \nthe Web, 32-bit numbers in C++) I now have to pass around a URI to the \nIndividualAccount service AND an account number. Logic would dictate \nthat your life would be simpler if you put them together into an opaque \ntuple:\n\n(http://machine/Account, 234324)\n\nLogically that would be encoded as:\n\nhttp://machine/Account/234324\n\nSomebody please tell me what the advantage of the service-oriented \nversion is! I don&#39;t understand why our industry would move in that \ndirection after ten years of OOP.\n\n&gt; This model seems to introduce some incidental complexity (see\n&gt; http://www.computer.org/proceedings/icre/0565/05650130abs.htm).  Instead\n&gt; of just representing an account as a single abstraction, we now have an\n&gt; account resource, an account-credit abstraction and an account-debit\n&gt; abstraction.\n\nArguably you could combine them. A domain expert would probably have to \nsay.\n\nBut anyhow, in a real banking app, every credit or debit is a unique, \npersistent object that can be referenced. It should be possible to list \nall credits for a particular day, etc.\n\n&gt; This is getting interesting.  Its making me think that if there were a\n&gt; good Object-&gt;REST mapping language we could have the best of both\n&gt; worlds: a fully &quot;dynamic object&quot; model (that allows OO notation and easy\n&gt; mapping to OOPLs) with a REST based messaging taking caring of the\n&gt; networking aspects.  I might noodle on this for a bit and see if I can\n&gt; come up with something.\n\nI started something like that with WRDL but I hold out hope that WSDL \ncan be reformed to work.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
