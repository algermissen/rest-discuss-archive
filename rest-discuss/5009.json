There was no request to be bad?\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m just accepting posted data, hence 400 seems wrong?\n&gt; \n&gt; The POSTed data you are &#39;accepting&#39; is always in the body of a\n&gt; request. You can&#39;t get POSTed data without having a request to\n&gt; extract it from.\n\nWhich to me doesn&#39;t make sense Vincent. However.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  Or should I be interpreting &#39;request&#39; in a more general sense\n&gt; &gt; than an http get?\n&gt; \n&gt; A request is one type of HTTP &#39;message&#39;. The term &#39;message&#39; is\n&gt; defined in the spec. A response is the other type of message.\nNot get and post?\n\n&gt; \n&gt; In brief: a request has a method name, a URI, a bunch of headers\n&gt; encoding request metadata and entity metadata, and an entity body.\n&gt; A client sends it to a server on a channel (TCP/IP socket), and\n&gt; waits for a response on the same channel.\n&gt; \n&gt; A response has a status code, a bunch of metadata headers, and\n&gt; an entity body. A server sends to a client in response to a\n&gt; particular request, on the same channel it received the request\n&gt; from.\n&gt; \n&gt; But I can&#39;t do this topic justice. The HTTP RFC spells this out,\n&gt; you just need to spend some quality time with it.\n\nOK OK :-)\n  I&#39;ll go read. \n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I prefer the idea of both a status code and content (xml message),\n&gt; &gt; just unsure if it was right.\n&gt; \n&gt; Given that the process is barfing on an XML parsing problem,\n&gt; I would use the output of the parser as the response body.\n\nThe &#39;barf&#39; is of my own making. Just unsure which level it belongs to.\n  Again, thanks for the comments.\n\nregards DaveP\n\n\n"}}
