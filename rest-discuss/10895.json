With SOAP, RPC or something like that I create a\n&gt;  &gt; method deactivate, an call it with the user number. How should\n&gt;  &gt; I model this with REST over HTTP? Do I have to GET the full\n&gt;  &gt; user data (JSON, XML, ...), change the state to &quot;deactivated&quot;\n&gt;  &gt; and PUT this back? Or should I PUT to the users sub resource\n&gt;  &gt; /users/1234/status/ the entity &quot;deactivated&quot;?\n&gt; \n&gt; You can do it both ways. They are both appropriate, though one\n&gt; more than the other depending on various circumstances.\n\nIn this case (deactivate) I think you&#39;ll find the user has a lifecycle \nand therefor there&#39;s a state machine implicit in the domain. Once that&#39;s \ncaptured it can be modeled as a series of PUT calls updating the user \nstate to either the user or the state URI.\n\nIf you already are using a extensible format for the user \nrepresentation, this might be easier to develop at the cost of clients \nhaving to know how to articulate the state transitions (eg by embedding \nmarkup representing the desired next state in some kind of user profile \ndocument). Having the extra &quot;state&quot; URI always seems attractive but it \nalways seems to require defining a new top level format just to \nmanipulate the state. The client ha to know that as well. My preference \nof late has been the former - define extensions to open formats like \nAtom and manipulate user state via the user URI.\n\nBill\n\n"}}
