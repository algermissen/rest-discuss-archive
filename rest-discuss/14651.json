I\nwish I could remember, seeing as how you&#39;re stuck with the opposite.\n\nI&#39;m going to hold off on answering your question until I have the demo\nI&#39;ve been working on furiously for the past two weeks, posted.  It\naddresses a variety of issues regarding REST, Xforms, and client-side\nXSLT.  Due to the demo&#39;s nature as client-side XSLT, I&#39;m wearing my\napplication logic on my sleeve as hypertext (which goes beyond the\nhypertext constraint, as opposed to breaking said constraint).\n\nThe application logic, whether the XSLT transformation is run on the\nclient or the server, is entirely based on link relations.  In fact,\nthe easiest part of distilling out a static example from my dynamic\nproject, turned out to be dismantling content negotiation.  All I did\nwas edit my Atom source files&#39; link relation @hrefs by adding filename\nextensions.  Which frees the demo up to run a directory browser so you\ncan introspect my files, including the content of dot files.\n\nSince the application logic is based on link relations, changing the\nURLs in the source Atom files also changed the URLs in the XHTML output\nwithout my having to change the XSLT stylesheet.  I think my demo will\nanswer a lot of the questions you&#39;ve been asking lately about machine\nclients, or at least give you plenty of food for thought.\n\nBear with for a few days, I almost posted it already but I&#39;ve torn the\nhttpd apart again... the httpd running the demo is a FOSS project I&#39;ve\nadopted and adapted to be a prototyping framework for REST development.\nThe source code for the httpd is posted as part of the demo.  Mostly not\nmy httpd code, but everything else is, save a line of XSLT and an XPATH\nstatement my partner contributed when I got stuck.\n\nWhile it looks like the same demo I&#39;ve been posting occasionally for 3\n1/2 years, there came a point where I took off my architect hat and\ndecided to write the damn code myself, after failing to explain to many\ndifferent coders how to base application logic on link relations.  I&#39;ll\nput my markup and CSS up against anyone&#39;s, and with more practice I&#39;ll\nbe saying that about my XSLT as well.  This should lay to rest the\nrecurring concerns about my skillz every time I try to contribute\nsomething of my knowledge (Web developer since Dec. 1993) somewhere.\n\nLike yesterday on www-tag when I was more-or-less accused of inventing\nthe Content-Script-Type header, in response to my polite suggestion that\nit be considered within the context of an ongoing discussion.  Sigh.\nOf course, my demo implements said header, and shows just exactly how\nit can be used to solve the issue of distinguishing between scripted\nand unscripted (X)HTML, and the issue of privilege escalation that I&#39;m\npatiently trying to explain to w3c folks where media type identifiers\nother than text/plain are concerned.\n\nJan, I really should point out that you&#39;re saying &quot;media type&quot; where\nyou really mean &quot;media type identifier&quot;, but the two are not the same\nthing.  I&#39;ve only recently decided that pointing this out isn&#39;t nit-\npicking, but crucial to understanding Web architecture (which REST is a\nsubset of).  Anyway, I&#39;ll save my elaboration on why media type\nidentifers only describe containers, for some other time.  You&#39;re\nleaning in a direction I reject out of hand, which is that a media type\nidentifier is a contract.  Contracts reside within the containers.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
