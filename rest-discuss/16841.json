The best approach is to take a big step back and come at the =\r\nproblem from a slightly different angle (or utensil? ;-).\n\nA summary of my =\r\nthoughts:\n- there is no &quot;right&quot;, generic way to use PUT to update a resourc=\r\ne that works across all resources and media types except specifying verbati=\r\nm how the resource should be represented in full. e.g. PUT the full .jpg im=\r\nage you expect to be served in a subsequent GET of the resource\n\n- if you a=\r\nre including enough data in a PUT to allow the the rest of the resource&#39;s s=\r\ntate to be derived by the server then you are ok. Alternatively, you can ha=\r\nve the server change the values the client suggests. This is my take on wha=\r\nt AtomPub does. It is necessary for things like identifiers and URIs (in ge=\r\nneral hypermedia controls) that the server needs control over.\n\n- omitting =\r\ninformation that the server is going to fill in is quite a different thing =\r\nfrom a &quot;partial update&quot; -- don&#39;t confuse the two. To me a &quot;partial update&quot; =\r\nis when the full resource state cannot be derived from the information you =\r\nare providing and the previous state of the resource needs to be factored i=\r\nn as well.\n\n- this leaves you with the problem of how the client knows what=\r\n information can be omitted (or is just a place-holder for the server&#39;s val=\r\nues). This is either (a) specified by the media type definition or (b) spec=\r\nified (or rather constrained) at run-time by a hypermedia control. I believ=\r\ne that AtomPub is an example of (a) but I&#39;ve never seen an example of (b) i=\r\nn the wild -- don&#39;t see why it is not possible though. \n\nIn general though,=\r\n hypermedia controls for PUT (and DELETE) really need further exploration. =\r\nI&#39;d like to see more examples of media types that describe how PUT/DELETE s=\r\nhould be used as well. I don&#39;t buy the &quot;you have the URI, so just invoke PU=\r\nT or DELETE on it&quot; generic approach -- you end up with problems like the on=\r\ne you are tackling here. At the end of the day though, unless you think the=\r\n idempotent property of PUT and DELETE is going to realize practical benefi=\r\nts for your system, you might just be better off using POST.\n\nAndrew\n\n--- I=\r\nn rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;alex.scordellis&quot; &lt;alex.scordellis@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; After reading REST in Practice &lt;http://restinpractice.com&gt; , =\r\nI was\n&gt; puzzled by the authors&#39; recommendation of POST over PUT for resourc=\r\ne\n&gt; updates. I thought through the implications of some of the alternatives=\r\n\n&gt; and wrote up my thoughts as a blog post\n&gt; &lt;http://alexscordellis.blogspo=\r\nt.com/2010/11/restful-architecture-what-sh&#92;\n&gt; ould-we-put.html&gt; . This trig=\r\ngered a very deep debate in the comments,\n&gt; revealing a number of subtletie=\r\ns that I had missed. I feel that the\n&gt; debate deserves a bigger forum than =\r\nthe comments of my blog, so I&#39;m\n&gt; moving it here.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you want the full=\r\n history of the debate, read my original post\n&gt; &lt;http://alexscordellis.blog=\r\nspot.com/2010/11/restful-architecture-what-sh&#92;\n&gt; ould-we-put.html&gt; , includ=\r\ning the comments, and William Vambenepe&#39;s\n&gt; response &lt;http://stage.vambenep=\r\ne.com/archives/1665&gt; , but here&#39;s a quick\n&gt; summary:\n&gt; \n&gt;     * Services se=\r\nrve representations including both business data and\n&gt; hypermedia controls.=\r\n Clients have no business sending the hypermedia\n&gt; controls to the service,=\r\n since they are determined by resource state and\n&gt; business rules hosted by=\r\n the server.\n&gt;     * Therefore we have to either PUT a partial representati=\r\non (data, but\n&gt; no links), or use a different HTTP method, for the client t=\r\no make a\n&gt; change to the resource.\n&gt;     * However, there are many complica=\r\ntions with using partial PUT, which\n&gt; are detailed in William Martinez&#39;s co=\r\nmment\n&gt; &lt;http://alexscordellis.blogspot.com/2010/11/restful-architecture-wh=\r\nat-sh&#92;\n&gt; ould-we-put.html?showComment=3D1288962611437#c255996206325049719&gt; =\r\n and\n&gt; William Vambenepe&#39;s post &lt;http://stage.vambenepe.com/archives/1665&gt; =\r\n.\n&gt;     * These complications may force us to use POST for changes which th=\r\ne\n&gt; client sees as full resource replacement, and therefore still feel more=\r\n\n&gt; like they should be a PUT\n&gt;     * An alternative, variations of which we=\r\nre suggested by Garry Shutler\n&gt; &lt;http://alexscordellis.blogspot.com/2010/11=\r\n/restful-architecture-what-sh&#92;\n&gt; ould-we-put.html?showComment=3D12888706604=\r\n89#c5473614401681968877&gt;  and\n&gt; Duncan Cragg\n&gt; &lt;http://alexscordellis.blogs=\r\npot.com/2010/11/restful-architecture-what-sh&#92;\n&gt; ould-we-put.html?showCommen=\r\nt=3D1289244765256#c299846722503776739&gt; , is to\n&gt; separate the resource into=\r\n two parts. One would be the resource that the\n&gt; client sends to the servic=\r\ne, and the other would be generated by the\n&gt; service and include hypermedia=\r\n controls and service-generated state\n&gt; information.\n&gt; \n&gt; This has been a g=\r\nreat debate. I&#39;ve learned a lot and it&#39;s forced me to\n&gt; think things throug=\r\nh very carefully; thank you to all participants.\n&gt; However I feel it has so=\r\n far been rather theoretical. I&#39;d be very\n&gt; excited to hear from people who=\r\n have tackled this problem in building\n&gt; real systems. What did you do? How=\r\n did that work out? Did you hit any of\n&gt; the complications of partial PUT d=\r\nescribed by the two Williams? If you\n&gt; used one of the alternatives, did yo=\r\nu feel that had any drawbacks?\n&gt; \n&gt; Discuss!\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
