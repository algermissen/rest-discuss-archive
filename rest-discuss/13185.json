It has the following protocol:\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nGET /profiles - returns a list of user profiles\n&gt; POST /profiles - adds a n=\r\new user profile\n&gt;\n&gt; GET /profiles/{userid} - gets the user profile of the s=\r\npecified user\n&gt; PUT /profiles/{userid} - update the user profile (non-brows=\r\ner)\n&gt; POST /profiles/{userid} - update the user profile (browser)\n&gt;\n&gt; etc.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d like it to work such that when a user does a GET\n&gt; /profiles/{useri=\r\nd}, the html representation that is returned either\n&gt; contains a link to a =\r\nform to be used to edit the profile data, or\n&gt; directly contains the form f=\r\nor editing. For the former the form could\n&gt; be located at /profiles/{userid=\r\n}?editform. In both cases, the form\n&gt; would be POSTed to /profiles/{userid}=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t feel strongly about either option and expect usability\n&gt; requi=\r\nrements or implementation details to guide me here (though I am\n&gt; intereste=\r\nd in opinions if somebody thinks there&#39;s a better way).\n&gt;\n&gt; My real questio=\r\nn has to do with providing a mechanism to create new\n&gt; users. I&#39;m really no=\r\nt sure what a good pattern for this might be. I\n&gt; can think of three possib=\r\nlities:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. GET /profiles/newuser to get the form, and POST to /profiles=\r\n\n&gt; This one kind of messes with the implied namespace of\n&gt; /profiles/{useri=\r\nd} in the newuser isnt really a userid\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. GET /profiles/ to get the for=\r\nm and POST to /profiles\n&gt; I think this is too subtle a distinction and prob=\r\nably has the\n&gt; collection semantics wrong\n&gt;\n&gt; 3. GET /profiles?newuser and =\r\nPOST to /profiles\n&gt; I dont have any real objection to this one at this poin=\r\nt.\n&gt;\n&gt; Option 3 seems like a winner, but I&#39;m curious as to what other optio=\r\nns\n&gt; there might be.
