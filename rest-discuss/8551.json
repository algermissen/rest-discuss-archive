In the example, I&#39;m intentionally\ntrying to draw a close relationship between the resource state and the\napplication state.  \n\nFrom the original example, you could imagine that based on the legal state\ntransitions on the resource (resource state), a client may want to gray-out\n(or not display) buttons that cause such transitions (application state).\nThe original example shows a close link between the two.\n\nTo make the original example more concrete, let&#39;s say R is an Engine.  S1 is\n&quot;Stopped&quot;, S2 is &quot;Starting&quot;, S3 is &quot;Stopping&quot;, and S4 is &quot;Running&quot;.  Assume\nthe Engine is &quot;Stopped&quot;.  \n\nA client enables a Start button and a Stop button based on Engine state.  A\npush of the Start button causes the client to issue an Engine state\ntransition to &quot;Running&quot; from &quot;Stopped&quot;.  On the way to running, the Engine\nis &quot;Starting&quot;.  During the transition from &quot;Starting&quot; to &quot;Running&quot;, we don&#39;t\nwant the client to enable the Start or Stop buttons.  While the Engine is\n&quot;Running&quot; we only want the client to enable the Stop button.\n\nFrom what I understand about &quot;hypermedia is the engine of...&quot;, the server\nwants to give the client hints about where the next legal transitions are.  \nSo how exactly would one structure the Engine representation and URIs to\nbest suite such ends?\n\n\n"}}
