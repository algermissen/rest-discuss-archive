I am assuming yes, but I want to make sure.\n&gt;\n&gt; Most trivial examples show (for example) the sending of an order&#39;s\n&gt; representation when the order is being updated.  But what if the user\n&gt; needs to send credentials so that the server can validate before\n&gt; actually updating the order?  How does this information get sent?\n\nAre these credentials different from those that could be sent via HTTP  \nauthentication?\n\n&gt; In other cases, &quot;processing instructions&quot; need to be provided so that\n&gt; the system knows exactly what to do the resource being manipulated -\n&gt; these processing instructions are not really part of the resource.\n\nCould you elaborate?
