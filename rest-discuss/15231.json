I get a strong feeling that there is a substantial shift in this direction\n\nThe shift is happening, but it appears that it is mostly a shift of hyped terms only and not a real architectural shift.\n\nThe true application of REST would be a radical shift towards simplicity and decoupling and as far as my experience goes, enterprises are not yet willing to let go of complexity :-) I have recently persuaded myself that the ubiquitiousness of object-oriented thinking is a major obstacle. We have all been so immersed in OOA, OOD, classes, interfaces, etc. that it is really hard to think differently about software systems. Maybe the apparent rise of functional languages helps to cure that situation...\n\n&gt; but I have no examples or figures that bear it out...\n\nI think many enterprise understand that there is a benefit induced by REST and start trying. But it is extremely rare, for example, that people understand that media type design is at the heart of all design activity (as opposed to service interface design, which is an implementation detail in REST).\n\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Sean.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n-----------------------------------\n Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n NORD Software Consulting\n\n Mail: algermissen@...\n Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n Work: http://www.nordsc.com/\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
