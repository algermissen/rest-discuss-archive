I have a set of draft posts and published posts. In order to ch=\r\nange a draft post to a published post I need to &quot;publish&quot; it. How should I =\r\nrepresent one such command in REST?\n\nHere is my thoughts so far:\n\nThe two s=\r\nets are represented by two different ATOM resources, each having their own =\r\nURL. Each individual post also has it&#39;s own resource URL. Nothing special h=\r\nere.\n\nIn order to publish a post I can do:\n\n1) Use a new HTTP verb called &quot;=\r\nPUBLISH&quot; and send that to the draft post I want to publish.\n\n2) POST the co=\r\nmplete blog post representation on the &quot;published posts&quot; URL, thereby addin=\r\ng the blog post to the published list, and implicitly remove it from the dr=\r\naft list.\n\n3) Do an empty POST to a sub-resource of the blog post named &quot;pu=\r\nblish&quot; indicating that I want to &quot;publish&quot; that resource.\n\n4) Expose the si=\r\nngle &quot;published&quot; state value as a sub-resource of the blog post and POST tr=\r\nue/false to that resource.\n\n5) Mainting a non-ATOM list of published blog p=\r\nost identifiers. When publishing a blog post I can POST that post&#39;s identif=\r\nier to the &quot;published&quot; identifier list (instead of sending the complete set=\r\n of blog post data).\n\nWhat are your suggestions?\n\nThanks, J=F8rn\n\n\n\n\n"}}
