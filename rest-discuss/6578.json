Fielding &lt;fielding@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I am curious as to why it is using &quot;application/xml&quot; as the media\n&gt; type instead of something more standardized.\n\nOn 9/26/06, Mark Baker &lt;distobj@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The other thing is the data formats and the use of application/xml.\n&gt; For content negotiation (not to mention other uses), application/xml\n&gt; is meaningless\n\nThanks Roy and Mark, that&#39;s exactly the kind of feedback I was hoping\nfor. I hadn&#39;t thought through the media type issue, but your arguments\nmake sense. I just changed the app and spec to use\n&quot;application/vnd.blinksale+xml&quot;. I understand that new media types are\nsupposed to be registered, but is there practical reason to bother,\nfor me or my customers?\n\nRoy wrote:\n&gt; Was something like the\n&gt; Visa XML Invoice (or any of the other various attempts) considered?\n&gt; If considered, were they rejected due to complexity or for some\n&gt; other reason?\n\nYeah, I looked at Visa XML Invoice and UBL; my reasons for not going\nthat direction come down to complexity (and perhaps a pinch of NIH\nsyndrome.) At least for this first step, I want something that is very\nsimple and closely corresponds with the existing data model and UI.\nNone of our customers have ever requested Visa or any other invoice\nformat; if we targeted auto makers or something, it&#39;d be a different\nstory.\n\nNonetheless, I&#39;m grateful you suggested not using &quot;application/xml&quot;\nfor my media type, so that I can more easily dispatch against other\nXML formats in the future, like perhaps the Visa format.\n\nMark wrote:\n&gt; The first is the documentation for the URI structure, e.g.\n&gt;\n&gt; http://example.blinksale.com/invoices/invoice_id/deliveries/delivery_id\n&gt;\n&gt; Though I can&#39;t tell for sure, it appears to me as though you expect\n&gt; clients to be hardcoded to use that structure, which would break the\n&gt; &quot;hypermedia&quot; constraint.  You&#39;d need to use a forms language in order\n&gt; to be able to declare that URI structure for consumption by the\n&gt; client, otherwise client and server would be more tightly coupled than\n&gt; is necessary and this could hurt the evolvability of your application.\n\nI&#39;m not sure that I understand all the issues behind the hypermedia\nconstraint, but I think this one&#39;s okay. For example, the API never\njust provides a delivery ID number and expects the client to construct\nthe URI; it uses the full URI of the delivery as the identifier. E.g.,\nthe XML representation of an invoice includes something like:\n\n  &lt;deliveries uri=&quot;http://example.blinksale.com/invoices/1/deliveries&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;delivery uri=&quot;http://example.blinksale.com/invoices/1/deliveries/3&quot;&gt;...&lt;/delivery&gt;\n  &lt;/deliveries&gt;\n\nIs that sufficient for the client to know that it should POST a new\ndelivery to &quot;/invoices/1/deliveries&quot;, etc.?\n\nThanks again for the feedback!\nScott\n\n"}}
