Note that\n&gt; the string can be *anything* that you want, but you checking the\n&gt; presence of a linked resource:\n\nNot to get all buzzwordy here, but that sounds like a rule based system.\n\nYou have media type behaviors keyed in to the system, somehow, so, for\nexample, you know what &quot;buy a product&quot; means in terms of what data\ngets sent to the &quot;buy now&quot; link, and, of course, that the &quot;#buyNnow&quot;\nlink actually MEANS &quot;buy now&quot;.\n\nOnce you have those base behaviors specified, then you can write write\nrules to react to conditions in pursuit of a goal.\n\nMost folks represent those rules statically, as ordered instructions\nin a program. Vs using some kind of rule system that manages to order\nthe rules based on the state of the application. This &quot;rule soup&quot; is\n(ideally) self organizing, but you typically have to do some kind of\nchicanery through state variables to keep rules from firing to soon,\nor to order the rules when more than one rule has the potential to\nfire. That&#39;s just a truth when dealing with any rule system.\n\nI think the key here, the real take away, is the underlying\ninfrastructure of dealing with the resources -- of coding the media\ntype and the actions as generic procedures. Whether you use a rule\nsystem to infer your workflow or explicitly lay it out using code, the\nunderlying relationships coded to the media types are the same.\n\nMaking that underlying infrastructure, the translating of the media\ntypes and supported operations in to code easier to create would be a\nreal boon. Such as doing a GET from #itemList, a GET that\nautomatically redirects if it has too. That alone would add a lot of\nrobustness to client code.\n\nFor most code, IMHO, having to use a rule engine for logic is simply\noverkill. Sure it can be more flexible, and resistant to change, but\none issue with that is that the rules were written given basic\nassumptions. And the premise is that those assumptions won&#39;t change,\neven if other premises are made on the hosting server. But,\nhistorically, many a system has overloaded an older concept using the\nsame identifiers with a new concept. And whatever assumption your rule\nsystem made upon that concept are now mistaken because it was never\ntold about the new assumptions associated with the same identifier as\npublished by the server system.\n\nSimple example is that the server could have changed the data type for\n&quot;buy now&quot; but not changed either the actual schema version (i.e. it&#39;s\nstill in http://example.com/buynow.xsd, say, just a different\nbuynow.xsd than the rules were developed for) or the operation (with\nis still a relation tagged &quot;buyNow&quot;). At a high level this looks the\nsame to your rule system, but in truth it could have changed &quot;beneath\nthe feet&quot; of the rule system, and the once &quot;more robust&quot; rule system\nis in truth no better than a hardcoded system.\n\nComputers have yet to do well when the creators lie to them :). And we\ncreators don&#39;t lie out of malice, simply laziness.\n\nA rule system is a good idea, I&#39;m just pointing out that there can be\na lot of issues with one.\n\n"}}
