The\n&gt; latter is in scope because it is part of the relationship between\n&gt; publisher and subscriber. The former is not.\n\nFair enough.\n\n&gt; First, it isn&#39;t sufficient to say: &quot;Their spec doesn&#39;t scale but ours\n&gt; doesn&#39;t either.&quot;\n\nI&#39;m not sure why not. ;-)  Point being, there are still some serious things\nto think about with both -wrt- scaling.   IMO, in order to get scale we&#39;re\ngoing to have to do one of two things, one trivial, one hard.  The trivial\nsolution is to leave it up to the origin server to stop accepting requests\nfor state notification at whatever level that server thinks is its scaling\nlimit and / or manage generation of notifications at an appropriate rate.\nThe hard solution is to figure out how to fan out that notification from the\norigin server through an arbitrary number of intermediaries.\n\n&gt; Second, I think that a subscription based spec is more amenable to\n&gt; optimization. If the publisher pushes enough information to the client\n&gt; that the client is &quot;happy&quot; then there is no need for a GET which avoids\n&gt; a GET-flood. I would expect this to be the common case.\n\nQuite possibly, but it seems this is both an optimization and, it would seem,\ncompatible with the basic idea.  (The basic idea is that rather than\nlong-lived subscriptions that have to be managed you instead use traditional\ncache age / freshness heuristics and an at-most-once or one-shot invalidation\nnotification.)\n\nSecond, it&#39;s important to note that the mechanism for scaling and balance is\n*better understood* in a GET + one-shot invalidation scenario than in a pure\npush scenario.  The origin server can avoid GET storms by simply interleaving\ninvalidation notifications with servicing the correspondig GETs, no\n\n&gt; Consider implementing a chat program using only GETs and cache\n&gt; invalidation. You would double the latency, bandwidth usage etc.\n\nThe more I think about it, the more convinced I am that this type of app is\nmost suited for a long-running GET rather than either fine-grained events\nwith state or cache invalidation.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
