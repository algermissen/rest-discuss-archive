He says &quot;each\n&gt; request from client to =\r\nserver must contain all of the information\n&gt; necessary to understand the re=\r\nquest, and cannot take advantage of any\n&gt; stored context on the server.&quot;  B=\r\nut what does &quot;understanding the\n&gt; request&quot; mean?  What is &quot;stored context&quot;?=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Couldn&#39;t any data on the server be considered &quot;stored context&quot;?  If we=\r\n\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t have any state on the server, it doesn&#39;t even have, say, a\n&gt; l=\r\nist of books available for purchase.  Because that&#39;s state.  It should\n&gt; ju=\r\nst have a purely functional algorithm, like a mathematical formula.  I\n&gt; do=\r\nn&#39;t think that&#39;s what Fielding meant, but he doesn&#39;t show where to\n&gt; draw t=\r\nhe line.\n\nHere&#39;s how I interpret the &quot;stored context on server&quot; ban (might =\r\nnot\nbe how Roy Fielding interprets it, but Roy intervenes periodically on\nt=\r\nhis list when somebody misreads REST principles, so I assume I will\nbe corr=\r\nected if wrong):\n\nAs long as it&#39;s a Web resource with a URI, it&#39;s ok to tak=\r\ne advantage of it.\nThe acronym stands for REpresentational State Transfer, =\r\nafter all.\nSo it&#39;s all about transferring the state of resources.\n\nSo for e=\r\nxample in responding to an offer to buy something, the server\nmight consult=\r\n another resource to get a credit authorization.  That&#39;s\nnot part of the or=\r\niginal incoming offer message, but it&#39;s another\nresource with a URI, so in =\r\nmy interpretation, it is fully RESTful.\n\nAnd the buyer cannot supply the cr=\r\nedit authorization in the offer\nmessage, so I don&#39;t know how the seller wou=\r\nld do business if unable to\nget it from another resource.\n\nThat is differen=\r\nt (in my mind) from taking advantage of stored context\non the same server, =\r\nwhich ties the exchange down to one server.\n\nGiven that you can take advant=\r\nage of other Web resources, I don&#39;t see\nwhy you can&#39;t do anything I can thi=\r\nnk of in an ecommerce application.\n\nIn my interpretation, you could also sa=\r\nve user or session information\nin a Web resource and retrieve a representat=\r\nion in the context of\nresponding to a new incoming message.\n\nDoes anybody d=\r\nisagree?\n\n"}}
