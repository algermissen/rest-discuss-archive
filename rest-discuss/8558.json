What about non-browser-based clients or\n&gt;&gt; &gt; machine-to-machine communications where a media such as XML would be more\n&gt;&gt; &gt; suitable?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; That looks like XML to me.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; What is there that a machine can&#39;t read?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Just to restate what Nic is saying, and what I said above: Your\n&gt; hypermedia has to indicate to the client the allowed transitions. If\n&gt; the hypermedia is HTML then that&#39;s often a form. But your custom xml\n&gt; can have link elements too. Those and only those would be the allowed\n&gt; transitions.\n\nJust to restate what High is saying (heh!) the hypermedia can be so\nsimple that there is only one state variable, as in this example.\n\nWell then the resource representation can use markup to represent the\navailable state transitions.\n\nI mean, you could mark this up in fifty gazillion different ways to\nsay the same thing, the HTML is just a convieniant lingua franca.\n\nNote that there isn&#39;t a FORM here... it&#39;s just a simple resource\nrepresentation to say &quot;this resource can contain one of these\nstates&quot;. The client would explicitly have to understand that&#39;s what\nthis representation means.\n\nThat could be made better, as Hugh says, by using a FORM or through\nusing links. But often it&#39;s not necessary because your client has to\nbe coded to understand explicitly anyway.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   \n\n"}}
