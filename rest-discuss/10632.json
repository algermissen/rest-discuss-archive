Take a damn close look at  \nRoy&#39;s dissertation (and make sure you also get most of his excellent  \nreferences) and the work of Garlan and Shaw and then try to evolve the  \nframework to serve as a foundation to reason about architectures  \nderived from REST (along the lines: if we add constraint X then the  \neffect on system property Y is such and such - or: what is the effect  \nof removing constraint Z from REST? What is the benefit in what  \nscenarios, what is the cost). See also Rohit Khares dissertation[1].\n\nThis is likely by far the hardest topic but also the most rewarding  \none for you - and everyone else.\n\nHTH,\nJan\n\nP.S. Another one I like is &quot;Authentication without shared knowledge&quot;.  \nRead a paper on this a while ago but cannot remember where. ACM I think.\n\n\n\n[1] &lt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~rohit/Khare-Thesis-FINAL.pdf&gt;\n\n\nOn Apr 14, 2008, at 4:12 PM, seandkennedy wrote:\n&gt; Hi everyone,\n&gt;\n&gt; My name is Sean Kennedy. I am a lecturer in the Athlone\n&gt; Institute of Technology in Ireland. I am also doing a PhD. - Web\n&gt; services has caught my attention and REST in particular.\n&gt;\n&gt; The reason I am writing to you all is that I am struggling to find\n&gt; that &quot;angle&quot; in my PhD. I would love to help in the propogation of  \n&gt; REST\n&gt; but am at a loss as to how my research can help.\n&gt; My superviser suggested either a) developing the concept further or b)\n&gt; solving issues with regard to REST and QoS e.g. reliability, security\n&gt; and transactions.\n&gt; My understanding with regard to b) is that REST uses https for  \n&gt; security\n&gt; and Post Once Only for reliability. The area of reliability is\n&gt; attractive but I am open to ideas...\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks and regards,\n&gt; Sean.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
