Seems like different people are operating with different\n&gt; (pefrectly valid) definitions for the word identity:\n&gt;\n&gt;    1. The collective aspect of the set of characteristics by which a\n&gt;       thing is definitively recognizable or known: ?If the broadcast\n&gt;       group is the financial guts of the company, the news division\n&gt;       is its public identity? (Bill Powell).\n&gt;    2. The set of behavioral or personal characteristics by which an\n&gt;       individual is recognizable as a member of a group.\n\nYup, this is one way of understanding the concept of identity. I guess \nyou could call it the social or psychological sense.\n\n&gt;    3. The quality or condition of being the same as something else.\n&gt;    4. _/Mathematics./_\n&gt;          1. An equation that is satisfied by any number that replaces\n&gt;             the letter for which the equation is defined.\n&gt;          2. Identity element.\n\nCall this the logical sense.\n\nThese two are pretty much equivalent. An equation states that the \nexpression on the LHS of an &#39;=&#39; picks out the same entity as the \nexpression on the RHS. An identity element is an element which supports \na particular class of equations, eg. 0 and 1 in x+0 = x and x*1 = x.\n\nFWIW, I think the logical sense is the only sensible option (if nothing \nelse because in the social/psychological sense things can have multiple \nidentities, which would be much too confusing to be useful here).\n\nCheers,\n\n\nMiles\n\n"}}
