Let&#39;s see if I hit a sweet spot\nor if I&#39;m just missing something (more likely, please forgive me).\n\nI have several images, each with its own uri that have metadata.\nIf I want to update the metadata of a given image I send a POST\nrequest on its uri. Right?\nWhat if I want to atomically update some metadata (say, a tag) for a\ngroup of images, how do I approach that?\nSending multiple POST requests, one for each uri, is not atomic, so I\ncan&#39;t accept it.\n\nI thought about posting on the common parent of all the image uris\n(say, if I have /images/1, /images/2, etc., then I post on /images).\nIn the parameters of the post request I would put a list of all the\nimaged ids (or entire uri), so that the server can handle the request\natomically.\n\nBut then what should I get in return? What should /images return if I\nissued a GET? The whole repository? Naaa... too big.\nIsn&#39;t the POST supposed to return the same representation? Just after\nhandling the posted request.\n\nHow much am I missing from the rest picture?\n\nThanks\nStefano\n\n"}}
