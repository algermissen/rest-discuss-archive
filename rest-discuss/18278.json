At some level developers (human beings) need to commu=\r\nnicate and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; reason about the software they write. Every web service pro=\r\nvides\n&gt;&gt; &gt; information about something. Apart from the practical integratio=\r\nn of a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; client with a server we need to be able to discuss the &quot;somethi=\r\nng&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; rationale behind a given service.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; No. You discuss the ration=\r\nale behind service &#39;kinds&#39; and that is part of\n&gt;&gt; setting up the media type=\r\n. The kind &#39;feed server&#39; is (implicitly I guess)\n&gt;&gt; defined in the media ty=\r\npe spec. You do not talk about the AtomPub service X\n&gt;&gt; of organization Y. =\r\nAll you need to know is that it is &#39;a feed server&#39; and\n&gt;&gt; then you say Acce=\r\npt: application/atom+xml, application/rss+xml and off you\n&gt;&gt; go. There is n=\r\no need to talk about *that* service any further. The\n&gt;&gt; description of the =\r\nservice *is* in the media type. There are *no* (thatis:\n&gt;&gt; none whatsoever)=\r\n service specific descriptions in RESTful systems.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Otherwise I a=\r\ns a developer won&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; &gt; know if the information of a given service is of i=\r\nnterest to me. This\n&gt;&gt; &gt; reasoning between developers (human beings) is at =\r\na conceptual level.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Furthermore software is not only meant for cumpute=\r\nrs, it&#39;s also meant\n&gt;&gt; &gt; for humans to read and understand and reason about=\r\n.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Right - but this is intent (&quot;I want to buy a book, therefore I dire=\r\nct my\n&gt;&gt; browser to http://amazon.de and not http://weather.info).

My=\r\n point in the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; discussion was that it may be of interest to talk about =\r\nthe concepts\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and information a service is meant to provide in order to=\r\n then be able\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to reason about what media types to use or invent for a =\r\ngiven service.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Well, &#39;entities&#39; such as feeds, feed-entries, images, =\r\nproducts, orders,\n&gt;&gt; contact-info (vcard), events (icalendar) etc. surely a=\r\nre part of designing\n&gt;&gt; media types.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Let me say it again: th=\r\ne problem that is being tried to solve does\n&gt;&gt; not &gt; &gt; exist.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Is =\r\nthis your way of saying there is nothing to discuss?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yes :-) The whol=\r\ne strict point of &#39;specific media types are a bad idea&#39;\n&gt;&gt; is simply confus=\r\ning people trying to understand REST. Maybe the discussion\n&gt;&gt; is useful aft=\r\ner all, though.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Or are you\n&gt;&gt; &gt; saying there is no problem in decid=\r\ning whether to define new media\n&gt;&gt; &gt; types or not? My understanding of the =\r\ndiscussion was that we were\n&gt;&gt; &gt; discussing heuristics for inventing (or no=\r\nt inventing) new media\n&gt;&gt; &gt; types.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The thing is, that it is actually =\r\npretty clear that generic media types +\n&gt;&gt; embedded specific stuff + a new =\r\nmeans for negotiating that stuff is silly\n&gt;&gt; because the mechanism for nego=\r\ntiation such stuff is the media type\n&gt;&gt; identifier in the first place. It i=\r\ns the mechanism built into HTTP for that\n&gt;&gt; purpose.\n&gt;&gt; (Not to question th=\r\ne usefulness of standard general link relations\n&gt;&gt; orthogonal to media type=\r\ns, of course)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Specific media types is what one should do and there is=\r\n no problem with\n&gt;&gt; them. Yet, some people make it sound as if there is a p=\r\nroblem - and this I\n&gt;&gt; find is adding confusion for others that try to lear=\r\nn REST.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Jan\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; /Paul\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; --\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Paul Cohen\n&gt;&gt; &gt; www.=\r\nseibostudios.se\n&gt;&gt; &gt; mobile: +46 730 787 035\n&gt;&gt; &gt; e-mail: paul.cohen@seibos=\r\ntudios.se\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------**------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yah=\r\noo!

I didn&#39;t say that either.=\r\n I&#39;m saying there are design and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; implementation aspects of sys=\r\ntem interfaces that are not covered by&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; HTTP. At some level develop=\r\ners (human beings) need to communicate and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; reason about the softwa=\r\nre they write. Every web service provides&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; information about someth=\r\ning. Apart from the practical integration of a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; client with a serve=\r\nr we need to be able to discuss the &quot;something&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; rational=\r\ne behind a given service.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nNo. You discuss the rationale behind ser=\r\nvice &#39;kinds&#39; and that is part of setting up the media type. The kin=\r\nd &#39;feed server&#39; is (implicitly I guess) defined in the media type s=\r\npec. You do not talk about the AtomPub service X of organization Y. All you=\r\n need to know is that it is &#39;a feed server&#39; and then you say Accept=\r\n: application/atom+xml, application/rss+xml and off you go. There is no nee=\r\nd to talk about *that* service any further. The description of the service =\r\n*is* in the media type. There are *no* (thatis: none whatsoever) service sp=\r\necific descriptions in RESTful systems.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Otherwise I as =\r\na developer won&#39;t&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; know if the information of a given service i=\r\ns of interest to me. This&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; reasoning between developers (human bein=\r\ngs) is at a conceptual level.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Furthermore software is not only mea=\r\nnt for cumputers, it&#39;s also meant&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; for humans to read and under=\r\nstand and reason about.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nRight - but this is intent (&quot;I want t=\r\no buy a book, therefore I direct my browser to &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://amazon.de&quot;=\r\n target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://amazon.de&lt;/a&gt; and not &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://weather.i=\r\nnfo&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://weather.info&lt;/a&gt;). No architectural style wil=\r\nl help to ensure the Amazon is still selling books tomorrow.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Maybe the term &quot;conceptual type&quot; was unfortunate. My po=\r\nint in the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; discussion was that it may be of interest to talk about=\r\n the concepts&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and information a service is meant to provide in ord=\r\ner to then be able&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to reason about what media types to use or inve=\r\nnt for a given service.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWell, &#39;entities&#39; such as feeds, fe=\r\ned-entries, images, products, orders, contact-info (vcard), events (icalend=\r\nar) etc. surely are part of designing media types.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; Let me say it again: the problem that is being tried to solve does not =\r\n&gt; &gt; exist.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Is this your way of saying there is noth=\r\ning to discuss?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nYes :-) The whole strict point of &#39;specific me=\r\ndia types are a bad idea&#39; is simply confusing people trying to understa=\r\nnd REST. Maybe the discussion is useful after all, though.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Or=\r\n are you&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; saying there is no problem in deciding whether to define =\r\nnew media&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; types or not? My understanding of the discussion was tha=\r\nt we were&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; discussing heuristics for inventing (or not inventing) n=\r\new media&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; types.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe thing is, that it is actually pretty =\r\nclear that generic media types + embedded specific stuff + a new means for =\r\nnegotiating that stuff is silly because the mechanism for negotiation such =\r\nstuff is the media type identifier in the first place. It is the mechanism =\r\nbuilt into HTTP for that purpose.&lt;br&gt;\n\n(Not to question the usefulness of s=\r\ntandard general link relations orthogonal to media types, of course)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nSpecific media types is what one should do and there is no problem with =\r\nthem.
