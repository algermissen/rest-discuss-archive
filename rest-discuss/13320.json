A &quot;REST\n&gt; Patterns&quot; site I think would be very helpful to a lot of people as it\n&gt; would give solid examples of how some things could be done, even if\n&gt; does not present the to the metal specifics of how it is done.\n&gt; \n\nThis isn&#39;t something I think myself or Red Hat should do.

A website to \nback up this cookbook might be an nice add on.\n\nRed Hat will stick to middleware services.\n\n\n&gt; It can promote the REST architecture and talk at a higher level, it\n&gt; could even leave HTTP completely out of the equation.\n&gt; \n&gt; REST is a new way of thinking for many, and having answers to &quot;how do\n&gt; I...&quot; questions, in a central place, with some nice diagrams at a high\n&gt; level, would be very valuable.\n&gt; \n&gt; The goal being not interoperability, per se, rather best practices for\n&gt; REST in the enterprise, regardless of the actual protocols etc. used.\n&gt; \n\nMany developers I talk to are *hungry* for true interoperability. \nMyself included.\n\n\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
