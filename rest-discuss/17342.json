When describing a domain it&#39;s often not a main issue of missi=\r\nng media \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; types. I think, one would rather quickly find an appropriate=\r\nd generic \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; media type. However, the issue of describing a domain lies =\r\nnot only at \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the representation and process model level (which is gene=\r\nrally also \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; independent from the representation level, or?), the descr=\r\niption of the \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; domain itself is thereby very important - modelling the=\r\n concepts of for \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; instance &#39;user&#39;, &#39;order&#39;, &#39;offer&#39; etc.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is =\r\nfor me exactly the point where Semantic Web knowledge \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; representation =\r\nlanguages on top of RDF Model can come into play. So I \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can still use =\r\na generic media type, i.e. RDF Model, for realizing a \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; common descript=\r\nion. However, serialize these descriptions into specific \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; representati=\r\non media types, i.e. XHTML+RDFa, and thereby maybe also \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; extending the=\r\n process model (based on a general description). Layering \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of media ty=\r\npes was already propagated by Roy T. Fielding, or?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; All in all, I think=\r\n, it depends more on the degree of existing \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; appropriated Semantic Web=\r\n ontologies to model (parts of) a domain, \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rather then on existing med=\r\nia types. While there can (theoretically) \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; exist a huge variety of bot=\r\nh and such a huge amount would decrease the \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; simplicity property in bo=\r\nth cases; I nevertheless think, that it is \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; maybe better to have less =\r\nmedia types and more (especially reusable) \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Semantic Web ontologies, r=\r\nather then an equal high amount of media types.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To summarize, I think =\r\nthe application, reutilization and (if needed) \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; creation of Semantic W=\r\neb ontologies fit quite well for emphasizing the \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; desired properties t=\r\nhat should be reached when implementing the REST \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; architectural style.=\r\n The costs that have to be invested into good \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ontology design maybe a=\r\nlign with the costs of proper media type design.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You maybe still addre=\r\nssed this issue somehow, when saying &quot;media type \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (and link relation e=\r\ntc.) specifications&quot;. Anyway, I think, it might be \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; good to make this =\r\nconcern a bit more explicit. You might not explicitly \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; propagate the u=\r\ntilization of Semantic Web ontologies, but please make \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; aware of the g=\r\neneral existing &#39;description level&#39; (cf. [1]), which (from \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; my point o=\r\nf view) exists already, but is then often more implicit than \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; explicit=\r\n available.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. I think, fulfilling the hypermedia as the engine =\r\nof application state \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; constraint is maybe still the hardest part. I ca=\r\nnnot really imagine that \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;a transition from HTTP-based Type || to RES=\r\nT at a later point in time, \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; however, is rather easy&quot;. Furthermore, &quot;t=\r\nurning a HTTP-based Type || API \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; into a REST API might be as easy as d=\r\neleting the API documentation&quot; is a \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bit paradox from my point of view=\r\n. When I would remove the API \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; documentation than this application can=\r\nnot really be an API any more, \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or? When I would like to program again=\r\nst (?) something ( ;) ), I have to \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; know how I could do that. For inst=\r\nance a web browser do not really \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; program against (?) something.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nI think the term &#39;REST API&#39; might be a bit inappropriate here (I still \n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; doubt that a implementation of service, which is fully REST compatible, \n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is possible). The given examples for REST are not really APIs, or? - \n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AtomPub is a protocol, OpenSearch a specification (collection of media=\r\n \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; type specifications), &quot;RESTifying Procurement&quot; an approach of a \n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; proof-of-concept REST &quot;service&quot;(?) (I couldn&#39;t really figure out the \n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; current state of that project, however it looks quite interesting). \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n Although, the chosen descriptor is still &#39;REST&#39; and not &quot;REST API&quot;. So \n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; one might conclude that this could be a bit inappropriated \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; classif=\r\nication, but the descriptions are explicitly suggesting the \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; applicati=\r\non of REST principles on the implementation of (Web) services ;)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n 3. Just a small issue: better &quot;REST might be the best solution&quot;, rather \n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; than &quot;REST is the best solution&quot;. I guess, &#39;is&#39; requires a kind of \n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; proof, or? Could we really provide a complete proof about this? - I \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n currently don&#39;t think so.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That&#39;s all for the moment.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bob\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [1] \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://infoservice=\r\nonto.smiy.org/2010/11/25/on-resources-information-resources-and-documents/\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n Yahoo!
