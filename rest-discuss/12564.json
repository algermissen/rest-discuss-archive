The server\n&gt;     Rickard&gt; wouldn&#39;t know how the client came to its conclusion about\n&gt;     Rickard&gt; the suggested new state, and so cannot enforce validaton\n&gt;     Rickard&gt; rules about the new state.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t get you. You are saying you rely on the client not to do the\n&gt; wrong thing?\n\nSort of: I don&#39;t want to rely on the client doing the right thing. \nThere&#39;s going to be all sorts of domain logic that will be rapidly \nupdated, and so by not keeping that in the client will make it easier to \nensure that the right code is executed. But this leads me to commands \nbeing invoked to update state, and that leads me away from using a \nresource-oriented view for updates. Instead the client will query for \nresources, construct commands, and send that back which will update a \nbunch of different resources as a result. Initially I considered keeping \nthe logic for how to implement the commands in the client (which would \nthen lead to only state being sent to the server), but this became too \nmessy, insecure and unmaintainable, as outlined. But now I&#39;m trying to \nfigure out whether what I&#39;m doing is simply not compatible with REST, or \nif there is any way I can construct my application to still be RESTful, \nwhile doing commands.\n\nMy reading of Webbers &quot;How to GET a cup of \ncoffee&quot;(http://www.infoq.com/articles/webber-rest-workflow) leads me to \nbelieve it is possible, as his &quot;next&quot; workflow steps is pretty much \nexactly what I want to accomplish. A set of commands in a workflow \nexplicitly exposed as resources that I can GET (to get the form) and \nPOST (to execute). If that&#39;s RESTful, then I&#39;m happy!\n\n/Rickard\n\n"}}
