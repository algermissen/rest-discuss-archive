So a\n&gt; feed that contains one (or even better two feeds)... and for the\n&gt; parent feed and the child feeds they contain some additional data\n&gt; beyond the standard fields supportted by Atom. I think an example\n&gt; would really solidify it in my mind.\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;m working on your example.  The demo I posted shows what I&#39;m talking\nabout, but I haven&#39;t worked the rest of my solution into the demo yet.\nWhen I have, I&#39;ll bump here.  I&#39;m almost finished (I think) making the\nXSLT also function in Opera (using a holistic approach to the cross-\nbrowser XSLT problem, rather than using @mode and an engine test, i.e.\nmaking some code specific to Mozilla&#39;s Transformiix processor or Opera&#39;s\nlibxslt).\n\nAfter I&#39;ve made the XSLT work with WebKit, I&#39;ll work those other tricks\nup my sleeve for dealing with collections into the demo.  Then I&#39;ll make\nthe XSLT work with IE, so I can get back to my original problem, which\nis dealing with Xforms.  IE has a couple of nice Xforms extensions\navailable.\n\nThe result of this work, for me, will be a development style based on\nthe union of subsets of XSLT 1.0, EXSLT and Xforms that works on the\nWeb.  And, a coding style (which can be validated using RELAX NG +\nSchematron) for hitting that cross-browser sweet spot, which results in\ncode that also works for server-side transformation (if nothing else\nworks, libxslt can be used on the server).\n\nAnyway, I ought to be able to provide an interesting collection example\nfor you later this week.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
