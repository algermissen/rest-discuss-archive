Is anyone working on a\n&gt;ReST Oriented Programming Environments?\n\nIn my opinion this theory comes close:\n\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~franz/pubs-pdf/C13.pdf\n\nThis one is a bit more specific, really good example code, but the pages \nseem to be scanned and are very hard to read, definitely worth a try though:\n\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~franz/pubs-pdf/J06.pdf\n\n-- Erik\n\n\n\n\n"}}
