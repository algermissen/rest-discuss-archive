What hasn&#39;t happened is for a\nlarge number of people to implement a standard approach for sending that\nfinal response message to the sender - but there are lots of ways to do that\n(take a look at the REST discussion groups).\n\nMike\n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;sa3ruby&quot; &lt;rubys@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, May 02, 2002 6:00 AM\nSubject: [rest-discuss] Re: etcon BOF?\n\n\n&gt; --- In rest-discuss@y..., Lucas Gonze &lt;lucas@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Is there anything to accomplish via a BOF at ETCON?
