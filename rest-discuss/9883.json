The \n&quot;document()&quot; function allows me to bring in as many sources as necessary, \nand passing a URL as the argument to the document() function works fine.\n\nSo any existing resources are fair game for remixing into new resources. \nThe only problem is those resources that require authentication.  I have \nimplemented a system for passing a URL token that will allow \nauthentication which is simply an md5 digest of the url plus some &#39;salt&#39; \nthat both the requestor and provider of the source document know, but this \nonly works when both sides of the service know what that &#39;salt&#39; is.  In \nmany cases, this works fine (sort of like the same-origin policy for \nxmlhttprequest).\n\nAnyone have further thoughts on authentication schemes for resources when \nthe requestor (e.g., XSLT&#39;s document() function) has no way to set basic \nhttp auth headers?\n\nthanks-\nPeter Keane\ndaseproject.org\n\n\n"}}
