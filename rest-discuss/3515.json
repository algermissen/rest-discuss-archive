Queries are more complex than just a\n&gt; list of keywords, and should be represented in xml. So my question is: how\n&gt; could I send the query to the server ?\n&gt; The obvious solution would be a POST, but as it is a search, GET would be\n&gt; more convenient?\n&gt; An other solution could be:\n&gt;     C: POST http://my.server.com/queries/\n&gt;     S: 201 Created\n&gt;          Location: http://my.server.com/queries/queries/1234\n&gt;     C: GET\n&gt; http://my.server.com/results?query=http://my.server.com/queries/queries/1234\n&gt;     or even\n&gt;     C: GET\n&gt; http://some.other-server.org/search?query=http://my.server.com/queries/queri\n&gt; es/1234\n&gt; but I&#39;d like to avoid to much round trip\n\nI agree that this seems to be too much for simple search engine queries, OTH\nI think it is a good idea to create a new resource for the &#39;information \nretrieval interaction&#39;, because it opens up the possibility for more complex\nretrieval tasks: You could distribute the URI of that resource to various\n&#39;information retrieval systems/agents&#39; that can GET the query parameters from\nit and POST the results to it. At any time, you could do a GET on the resource\nto see the current &#39;retrieval state&#39;, much like you can GET the state of a\nshipping order to track the delivery.\n\nI am curious: How do your queries look like?\n\nJan\n\n \n&gt; May be a redirect to the GETed adress instead of the 201 created whould be\n&gt; the solution ?\n&gt; (Other GETs can be done on this address without side effect).\n&gt; \n&gt; The problem here is that the server has to manager &quot;saved&quot; queries, and to\n&gt; delete them (when ???)\n&gt; \n&gt; Any ideas ?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; \n&gt; -------------\n&gt; Yannick Loiseau\n&gt; PhD Student in Information Reatrieval at Irit\n&gt; mailto: yloiseau@...\n&gt; mailto: loiseau@...\n&gt; -------------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
