Now we have the style of a style?  \n&gt; I.e, REST is substyle of the hypermedia style?\n\nREST is a composition of constraints that come from many styles.\n\n&gt; So I went back to the thesis to see how you defined hypermedia only  \n&gt; to discover that you don&#39;t. AFAICT there is only one definition  \n&gt; constraining hypermedia in your thesis: Hypermedia is defined by  \n&gt; the presence of application control information embedded within, or  \n&gt; as a layer above, the presentation of information. (I notice that  \n&gt; assertion is not footnoted.)\n&gt;\n&gt; This sentence really doesn&#39;t help since it uses the phrase defined  \n&gt; by not defined as.Thus, the sentence doesn&#39;t say what hypermedia  \n&gt; is, it merely imposes a constraint on the concept of hypermedia --  \n&gt; whatever it may be. Nowhere in the thesis is hypermedia (style)  \n&gt; ever cited or defined. Or is hypermedia not a style but the single  \n&gt; architectural constraint provided by the quoted sentence? All this  \n&gt; kind of makes it a moving target.\n\n*shrug*  I didn&#39;t think it needed to be &quot;defined as&quot; (at the time).\nToo many of my friends are experts in hypertext research and they\nprobably would have poked mercilessly at my final defense.\n\n&gt; [Current debate aside, I&#39;d be really interested to hear your  \n&gt; definition of hypermedia, or even just see some pointers to others&#39;  \n&gt; definitions that define it as an interaction style. All the  \n&gt; definitions I&#39;ve ever seen define hypermedia as a kind of media.  \n&gt; Even Ted Nelson defined hypermedia as simply the medium, not the  \n&gt; style.]\n\nSee slide 35 (pp. 50-53) of\n\nhttp://roy.gbiv.com/talks/200804_REST_ApacheCon.pdf\n\n&gt; All that being said, my argument still holds. Even if hypermedia is  \n&gt; defined as an interaction style (or something like a style) as  \n&gt; opposed to a particular kind of media (data), a style is no more an  \n&gt; engine than a set of HTML documents is an engine.\n\nOh, really?  I wonder what you think engine means.\n\n   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Engine\n\nAn engine is a system for transforming input into some form\nof output.  The engine in a car is a system for transforming\ngasoline into torque that can be applied to a drive axle.\n\nMy little bullet of a constraint\n\n   &quot;hypermedia as the engine of application state&quot;\n\ndoes not say that the engine is a hypertext document.  It describes\nthe engine as being a hypermedia system, much like a car&#39;s engine\nwould be described as an internal combustion system.\n\nI did not cite any specific reference for that because (AFAIK)\nthere doesn&#39;t exist any specific reference.  I was doing synthesis.\nNelson&#39;s definition is tied to what he cared about -- non-linear\nwriting as a form of poetry.  Conklin was entirely focused on\ngraphical user interfaces, so his definition is tied directly to\nGUI affordances.  My observation is something that I considered\nto be inherent in the design largely because the Web was based\non Engelbart&#39;s view of hypertext, but AFAIK Engelbart never actually\ndefined the term other than by how it was used in Augment/NLS\n\n&gt; To support this claim, let me quote further from the paragraph in  \n&gt; which the above quoted sentence appears (4.1.3):\n&gt;\n&gt; Hypermedia is defined by the presence of application control  \n&gt; information embedded within, or as a layer above, the presentation  \n&gt; of information. Distributed hypermedia allows the presentation and  \n&gt; control information to be stored at remote locations. By its  \n&gt; nature, user actions within a distributed hypermedia system require  \n&gt; the transfer of large amounts of data from where the data is stored  \n&gt; to where it is used.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yet again, we see that it is user actions (powered by the browser  \n&gt; software) that singled out as driving the application (&quot;user  \n&gt; actions ... require the transfer of ... data&quot;) -- the system does  \n&gt; not drive itself.\n\nUser actions are part of the system being designed.  That paragraph\nis talking about a design constraint imposed by the requirement that\nthe information be distributed all around the world.  Aside from using\nthe same term in two different ways, I don&#39;t see how that has anything\nto do with your point.  Whether or not the system drives itself is\nirrelevant.\n\n&gt; Saying that hypermedia (the entire system or style) is the engine  \n&gt; is like saying the entire automobile (or the architectural style  \n&gt; called &quot;automobile&quot;) is the engine. It may be true in a Zen-like  \n&gt; way (and believe me, I LOVE mystical philosophies), but it is  \n&gt; utterly confusing to 99% of humanity.\n\n99% of humanity was not my audience, and I&#39;ll hasten to bet that less\nthan 1% of humanity knows what an engine means even for something as\nmundane as an automobile.\n\n&gt; It is far clearer to the rest of humanity to say that the browser  \n&gt; (or more generally user agent) is the engine of state, the user is  \n&gt; the driver of state, and hypermedia is the representation of state.\n\nThe only reason that is clearer to the rest of humanity is\nbecause it is wrong.  It&#39;s like saying the Web is defined by\nwhat a user sees in MSIE.  I don&#39;t care how easy it may be for\na non-educated user to understand that definition: it is wrong\nand I have no interest in peddling simplified forms.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
