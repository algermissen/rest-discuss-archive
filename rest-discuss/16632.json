You can use the Web to illustrate various\naspects of some constraint, whereas I can use it to delineate between\nwhat does and doesn&#39;t meet that constraint within an existing, deployed\narchitecture.\n\nThe fact that REST may be used to both purposes, rather than being\nrestricted to use as a label for classification (client-server), is\nsomething I find interesting.  If I were in academia, and had students\ntrying to learn REST, I might ask them to describe the differences\nbetween these two documents in terms of REST:\n\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/\nhttp://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Architecture.html\n\nI&#39;m sure assignments like that are why my students would hate me...\n\nBoth documents share a similar architectural vision for an HTTP-based\nWeb of documents.  But, in certain cases, one follows the assumptions of\nREST while the other challenges those assumptions.  There&#39;s disagreement\naround both how to apply certain constraints, as well as around which\nconstraints are even necessary, which can help illuminate what REST\n*is* -- a discussion which offers no pragmatic assistance to me as an\nimplementer trying to figure out *how* to apply those constraints.\n\n-Eric\n\n(BTW, mca asked a while back about what term to use in lieu of calling\nthe entity self-descriptive; the second link coins self-describing.\nYes, in natural language these are synonyms; but technically, they have\ndiscrete definitions, neither of which are synonymous with self-\ndocumenting.)\n\n"}}
