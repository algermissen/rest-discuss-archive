By that I mean that foo.com/bar?a=b, by\n&gt; default, gets processed by the processor bound to foo.com/bar, but you\n&gt; often have to jump through hoops (URI rewriting, etc..) to get\n&gt; foo.com/bar/baz/ processed by the processor bound to foo.com/bar/.\n\nIn addition JSP and ASP prevent path based processing - you can&#39;t do\nfoo.com/bar.asp/baz/ or foo.com/bar.jsp/baz/ - which just plain sucks rocks.\n(I built a system that /depended/ on path based access to sub-information.\nIts all broken now. Thanks JCP.)\n\n\n\n"}}
