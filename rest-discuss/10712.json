What is the difference between this, and say, packaging the  \n&gt; same parts as some XML elements inside some envelope element?\n\nSeveral benefits:\n- Multipart messages are a standard way to represent compound payloads\n- You don&#39;t enforce the use of xml\n\nIf you were to compound those requests in a specific xml document, you need\nto define a custom mime type rather than reuse an existing one, force the\nunderstanding of the compound payload on the consumer, and you will end up\nhaving to represent the semantics of multiple requests by serializing your\nhttp message in one way or another, at which point it makes more sense from\nmy perspective to just package the message in its natural format\n(application/http is defined in rfc2616).\n\nWhere you are right is that the $batch is the definition of a service, and\nsome would argue that services have no place in a rest architecture, because\nall visible area should be resources. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s inherently bad to\nhave some resources be services that have no semantic value, I am just\nconcerned that you lose a lot of discoverability and you create orthogonal\nconcerns when dealing with an API.\n\nTo be clear on my position on this proposal: I really like the idea of\nmultipart of application/http and get the result in the same format. I am\nhowever not certain I like the semantics of the $batch url and the semantics\nassociated with that endpoint, how discoverable it is and how knowledge of\nthe transfer and format is sent to the client, so it&#39;s mixed reaction from\nme. But I don&#39;t like other proposals for the reasons i&#39;ve invoked in my\nprevious emails and the inherent flexibility of the multipart approach is\nvery seductive.\n\n--\nSerialSeb \n\n\n"}}
