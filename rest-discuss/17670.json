Who knows what\n&gt; &gt; they&#39;re doing. Your server can&#39;t tell the difference.\n&gt; \n&gt; I know, but what if I care less about intermediaries (think about\n&gt; securing representations - e.g. by https - it will eliminate\n&gt; intermediate caching efforts).\n&gt; \n\nThen what is your interest in REST?  You can design an outhouse as a\ngazebo, but functionally, it would lack the required privacy.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I think there is much more (business) value in concentrating on\n&gt; things like hypermedia, integration and interoperability\n&gt; (serendipitous use). \n&gt; \n\nI have to pay for bandwidth at the origin server, while maximizing\nuser-perceived performance, so I see plenty of business value in a\ngeneric interface which allows intermediaries I don&#39;t know about (and\nwhich don&#39;t know about my system) to scale my system for me.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
