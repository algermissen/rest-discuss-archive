Bowman &lt;eric@...&gt; [2007-07-13 00:15]:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; There&#39;s some disagreement here, which stems from the wording of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the RFC. But HTTP is not REST,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;HTTP is a protocol for REST applications.\n&gt; \n&gt; Following RFC 2616 doesn&#39;t begin to guarantee the resulting\n&gt; implementation won&#39;t break the constraints of REST.\n\nThat’s not the protocol’s job nor is it possible for the protocol\nto ensure that.\n\n&gt; Ergo, HTTP is not REST,\n\nTautological. HTTP is a _protocol_ for REST applications.\n\n&gt; nor is REST dependent on HTTP as a protocol (no matter what\n&gt; Microsoft says).\n\nI said HTTP is *a* protocol for REST applications.\n\nWhat were you trying to argue, again? You have not said a single\nthing that contradicts anything I said.\n\n&gt; A REST connector has a &quot;socket&quot; with the semantics of\n&gt; &quot;replace&quot;, each protocol (WAIS, Gopher, FTP, HTTP, presumably\n&gt; waka) has a method which corresponds to that socket. Don&#39;t plug\n&gt; HTTP PUT into any socket other than &quot;replace&quot; and don&#39;t plug\n&gt; FTP STOR into any socket other than &quot;replace&quot;. If you plug one\n&gt; method into multiple sockets, you&#39;ve broken this constraint.\n\nYou are talking about a universal interface, not just a uniform\ninterface.\n\nGood luck with that.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
