Cookie dependent URIs are inherently restless\n\n-or-\n\nb. (http-)authentication  is inherently restless\n   (401s considered RESTless)\n\n-or-\n\nc. Cookie/http-auth based *authorization* is inherently restless\n   (403s and 405s considered RESTless)\n\nYou all appear to be arguing for or against one of\nthese positions, but it is not clear which.\n\nHere is an example to clarify this distinction.\nThe choice is between\n\n(1) CookieBank uses cookies or auth to provide\naccess to a customer payment at URL:\n\n  http://CookieBank.com/accounts/payments/12\n\n(2) RestBank tops CookieBank by making URIs for\nspecific payments visible in the &quot;Location&quot; bar\nso users can forward them to others:\n\n  http://RestBank.com/accounts/user123/payments/12\n\n(3) RestAuthenticateBank claims superiority over\nRestBank because it logs who accesses forwarded\nURIs and who POSTs &quot;Cancel&quot; or &quot;Confirm&quot; to them:\n\n  http://RestAuthenticateBank.com/accounts/user123/payments/12\n\n(4) AuthorizeBank claims to be the best because\nits URIs are unforwardable.  Users who want to\nprovide their accountant access to a particular\npayment can do so.  Those user&#39;s can also be sure\nthat the accountant does not delegate handling to\nsome intern:\n\n  http://AuthorizeBank.com/account/user123/payments/12?user=user456\n\n  Note: Only the user authenticated as user456 may\n  access this URI!\n\nMy opinion:\n\nREST and Authentication are orthogonal, but that\npeople frequently abuse authentication to make it\nunrestful.  So, RESTAuthenticateBank is RESTful,\nbut CookieBank is not.\n\nAuthorizeBank is also RESTful.  There is a\nsubstantive difference between the specificity of\na URI and whether one can access it.  There are no\nstatus codes that indicate that the body returned\nis dependent on a cookie/auth.  However, there are\nstatus codes to indicate availability for\nparticular purposes, e.g. 403 Forbidden, 404 Not\nFound, 405 Not Allowed.\n\nCookieBank WOULD be restful if it sent a\ncontent-location header that specified the URI of\nthe underlying resource.  However, it would be\nannoying to have to check for the existence of\nthis header to determine which URI to forward.\n(Question: Is it legal to use content-location\nheader for this purpose?  If the customer forwards\nthe HTML version of the resource, can the\naccountant access it with an accept: header to\nretrieve the PDF version instead?)\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.

That\n&gt; &gt; URI is perfectly fine, even if what you GET from it differs depending\n&gt; &gt; upon who invoked GET, the time of day, etc..  To say otherwise is\n&gt; &gt; to prevent me from identifying a whole class of useful resources,\n&gt; &gt; such as &quot;The person to my right&quot;, &quot;The colour of the next traffic\n&gt; &gt; light up ahead&quot;, etc..\n&gt;\n&gt; It is not the URI on its own that I am arguing against. It is the\n&gt; absence of the user-specific resource URI that I am arguing\n&gt; against. I am arguing against using HTTP Auth as a resource\n&gt; identification supplement. The example URL is an example of a URL\n&gt; that requires supplemental resource identification information in\n&gt; order to provide any function.\n&gt;\n&gt; An application may very well provide container URLs, in addition\n&gt; to user-specific URLs, and be RESTful. It is the absence of the\n&gt; user-specific URLs that is RESTless.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tyler\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
