If it makes for a\nmuch simpler server implementation so be it, but in general I think it\nis poor manners to ask a client to rephrase a request the server\nunderstands perfectly well.\n\nIn all of these cases I would be strongly inclined to process the\nrequest normally and repond with the relevant content. I would try to\ninclude a link in the content and/or headers to the bookmark or\n&quot;permalink&quot; url for future reference, but I don&#39;t want to clog up the\nnetwork with repetitions of the same request through the redirection\nmechanism. I see redirection primarily as a mechanism to defer to a\nserver entity that understands the request properly or to deal with a\ndeprecated url.\n\nRoy, you wrote:\n&gt; No. Why would I have said &quot;For two resources to be the same, ...&quot; if\n&gt; I thought that changing a URI always resulted in different resources?\n&gt; They might be different resources, the client generally won&#39;t be able\n&gt; to figure that out, so the only safe assumption is that they are\n&gt; different resources until stated otherwise by the server.\n\nI worry about the notion of a resource being too airy-fairy. I take a\nfairly simple approach in my conversation. If the urls are different we\nare talking about two different resources. It might happen that they\ndemarcate the same application state, but client&#39;s can&#39;t know that. I\nwould suggest that even server&#39;s don&#39;t really know that. A mapping from\nURL to representation might be here today but gone after the restructure\ntomorrow. One of the aliases might become a redirection next week.\nSevers cannot say with certainty over the long-haul that multiple urls\nmap to the same application state. In that context I am very wary of\nlanguage that talks about two resources being the &quot;same&quot;, even if the\nmight happen to be equivalent for the forseeable future.\n\nI talk about different urls always referring to different resources. At\nany particular point in time the url demarcates a specific subset of\napplication state, though the server is free to change the mapping from\nurl to application state over time. Interacting with the resource\nreturns, replaces, adds to, destroys, or otherwise operates on the\ndemarcated application state by transferring representations of the\nstate being communicated. Different representations encode the state\nbeing communicated into different document types with different\ntradeoffs with respect to fidelity of semantics, document simplicity,\ngenerality of applicability and other design factors.\n\nBenjamin.\n\n\n"}}
