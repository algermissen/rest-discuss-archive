I&#39;m attracted to the simplicity\n&gt; of the REST style and the lightweight requirements it\n&gt; places upon its clients but am not certain that I&#39;ve\n&gt; fully grasped how to apply it to our particular\n&gt; service.  One of the recommendations I&#39;m having\n&gt; difficulty visualizing is how I can eliminate client\n&gt; session management.  In our application parameters for\n&gt; a query may be dependent upon the results of a\n&gt; previous query as in the case of generating routing\n&gt; information.  I&#39;m providing a brief description of\n&gt; what our system does and some of the constraints\n&gt; imposed upon it by our target platforms and would be\n&gt; very interested on any comments, advice on how I might\n&gt; go about re-implementing the system in a RESTful\n&gt; style.\n&gt;\n&gt; The LBS solution is currently provided to mobile\n&gt; phones.  The system provides maps, routing and\n&gt; directions in response to user GET and POST requests.\n&gt; Map images embedded in the resultant documents are\n&gt; cached on the server, other intermediate documents are\n&gt; generated but not cached. The current system is\n&gt; implemented through a number of ASP scripts that\n&gt; provide search, list, and detail pages for map\n&gt; locations.  Maps are generated dynamically for\n&gt; co-ordinates or named locations by a 3rd party system\n&gt; co-located on the same server and exposing an XML\n&gt; RPC-style interface.\n&gt;\n&gt; In prototyping the current non-REST system we\n&gt; discovered several limitations related to the phone\n&gt; handsets:\n&gt;\n&gt; - Some handsets have a maximum URL length of 255\n&gt; characters.  Passing session state in the URL along\n&gt; with co-ordinate pairs frequently took us above this\n&gt; limit.\n&gt; - Cookie support cannot be guaranteed for the phone\n&gt; browser precluding the use of native session-tracking\n&gt; mechanisms on the server\n&gt; - Variations in WML rendering require document\n&gt; transformation to phone-specific WML if optimal\n&gt; presentation is to be achieved\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in advance,\n&gt; Adam Ratcliffe\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Find local movie times and trailers on Yahoo!
