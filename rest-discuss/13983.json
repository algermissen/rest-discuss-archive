What are the\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; design\n&gt;&gt; &gt; conditions that lead to the creation of new resource state? E=\r\ntc.)\n&gt;&gt; I am\n&gt;&gt; &gt; trying to get away from the &quot;you could do this and you co=\r\nuld do that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; but you also could do it that way&quot; kinds of answers to pra=\r\nctical\n&gt;&gt; REST\n&gt;&gt; &gt; design questions.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I think I see what you are driv=\r\ning at with your distinction between\n&gt;&gt; session state vs resource state, bu=\r\nt I don&#39;t think the distinction\n&gt;&gt; is so clean in REST. Here&#39;s a relevant p=\r\nassage from Roy&#39;s thesis\n&gt;&gt; (5.3.3):\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The application state is control=\r\nled and stored by the user agent and\n&gt;&gt; can be composed of representations =\r\nfrom multiple servers. In\n&gt;&gt; addition to freeing the server from the scalab=\r\nility problems of\n&gt;&gt; storing state, this allows the user to directly manipu=\r\nlate the state\n&gt;&gt; (e.g., a Web browser&#39;s history), anticipate changes to th=\r\nat state\n&gt;&gt; (e.g., link maps and prefetching of representations), and jump =\r\nfrom\n&gt;&gt; one application to another (e.g., bookmarks and URI-entry dialogs).=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; [emphasis added]\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So at least a copy of the resource state (in the=\r\n form or a\n&gt;&gt; representation of that resource) is intended to be stored and=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; manipulated on the client side. For example, I believe this 5.3.3\n&gt;&gt; pa=\r\nragraph endorses the following scenario:\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =95 client receives=\r\n a representation of the works of art in a museum\n&gt;&gt; exhibit as list of art=\r\n works (name of work, name of artist) from a\n&gt;&gt; museum service on some muse=\r\num server\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =95 the client extracts the name of an artist (a s=\r\ntring) from the\n&gt;&gt; list and submits it to Wikipedia on a different set of s=\r\nervers\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =95 It takes the representation from Wikipedia and fo=\r\nrmats it into a\n&gt;&gt; popup for the user&#39;s UI visualization of the museum exhi=\r\nbit\n&gt;&gt; In this scenario the client &quot;jumps from one application (museum\n&gt;&gt; s=\r\nervice) to another (Wikipedia)&quot;, submitting representation data it\n&gt;&gt; recei=\r\nved from the first service to the second service. Your\n&gt;&gt; description above=\r\n seems to prohibit such a scenario (&quot;to continue\n&gt;&gt; its interaction with th=\r\ne service on another machine, it would not\n&gt;&gt; only need to take the appropr=\r\niate URIs with it ... but also other\n&gt;&gt; data elements&quot;).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; But in your=\r\n scenario, the client could allways, just be use of the one\n&gt; initial URI, =\r\npick up the interaction. And this is (IMHO) exactly the\n&gt; significance of s=\r\ntoring the application data as resource state - so\n&gt; that the client can pi=\r\nck it up again. If the data was not stored in\n&gt; the server it would have to=\r\n be stored on the client and the ability\n&gt; would be lost to pick up the con=\r\nversation just on the basis of the URI.\n&gt;\n&gt; Jan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It appears that RE=\r\nST endorses the use of &quot;application data&quot; stored\n&gt;&gt; on the client, at least=\r\n in the case where such data was at some\n&gt;&gt; point in the past received by t=\r\nhe client as part of a representation\n&gt;&gt; of a server-based resource.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n-- Nick\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --------------------------------------\n&gt; Jan Algerm=\r\nissen\n&gt;\n&gt; Mail: algermissen@...\n&gt; Blog: http://algermissen.blogspot.com=\r\n/\n&gt; Home: http://www.jalgermissen.com\n&gt; -----------------------------------=\r\n---\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
