Costello&quot; &lt;costello@...&gt;\r\nX-Yahoo-Group-Post: member; u=112610298\r\n\r\nThis discussion on whether verbs should be used in URIs is excellent! \nThanks Joe for raising this issue.  It has certainly stimulated new\nideas and questions in my mind.  Let&#39;s not let this discussion stop\nuntil we have fully explored all facets of this issue and have arrived\nat consensus.  I think that it is important that we (the REST community)\nspeak with a unified voice.\n\nLet me try to first summarize the issue and both sides of the argument. \nThen I will add my own thoughts on the topic.\n\nThe issue is this: should a URL be allowed to have verbs in it?\n\nExample.  Here&#39;s an example of a URL that contains a verb (add-to-cart)\n\n    http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/00345/add-to-cart\n\nLet&#39;s now summarize both sides of this issue\n\nThe Nouns-Only Camp\n\nThis side of the argument says that URLs should only contain nouns. \nThey say that verbs should not be allowed in URLs.  Here&#39;s why:\n\n1. By definition, resources are &quot;things&quot; not &quot;actions&quot;.  URLs identify\nresources, not functions.  \n\n2. Separation of concerns: keep the identification (i.e., the URL) of a\nresource separate from the methods (HTTP GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) applied\nto the resource.  In OO terms we might think of the URL as providing the\nname of the Object, and the HTTP methods as the generic set of methods\non the Object.  For example:\n\n     {http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/00345}.GET()\n\n3. Generic interface: keep the interface to resources generic - the HTTP\nmethods.  When you allow verbs then you are essentially expanding the\ninterface.  For example:\n\n   http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/00345/add-to-cart\n\nis essentially a composition of methods:\n\n     {{http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/00345}.add-to-cart()}.GET()\n\nThus, the resource (part 00345) is exposing an implementation function,\nadd-to-cart.\n\nThe Verbs-Allowed Camp\n\nThis side of the argument says that URLs should be allowed to contain\nverbs as well as nouns.  Here&#39;s why:\n\n1. It seems natural that you would want to identify a resource and tell\nit to take an action.  Some examples:\n\n   http://www.my-home.org/air-conditioning/on\n\n   http://www.google.com/search?topic=&quot;juice-machines&quot;\n\n2. Verb-oriented URLs are very program-friendly.  For example, a program\nto control devices in my house might look like this:\n\n   http://www.my-home.org/connect-to-central-computer\n   http://www.my-home.org/air-conditioning/on\n   http://www.my-home.org/air-conditioning/adjust-temp?value=68\n   http://www.my-home.org/stereo/on\n   http://www.my-home.org/stereo/play-cd?cd=Timeless-Serenity\n\n3. Unilaterally prohibiting functions as URI-accessible makes the Web\nless friendly and useable, as I will need to contort things to get\naround this constraint.  Imagine doing the above using just nouns.\n\nIs this a fair summary of both sides?  If not, please add/correct.\n\nNow for my own comments:\n\nAs always, I think best with a concrete example in front of me.  So,\nlet&#39;s consider Parts Depot.  This company has deployed some Web services\nto enable clients to:\n\n1. Get a list of parts\n2. Get detailed information about a part\n3. Purchase parts\n\nIt is the third service (purchase parts) which is most relevant to this\ndiscussion.\n\nLet&#39;s suppose that the client has used the first service to get the\nparts list, and then used the second service to drill down to get\ndetailed information about part 00345.  Suppose that this is the\nresponse:\n\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;p:Part xmlns:p=&quot;http://www.parts-depot.com&quot;   \n        xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;Part-ID&gt;00345&lt;/Part-ID&gt;\n      &lt;Name&gt;Widget-A&lt;/Name&gt;\n      &lt;Description&gt;\n          This part is used within the frap assembly\n      &lt;/Description&gt;\n      &lt;Specification\nxlink:href=&quot;http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/00345/specification&quot;/&gt;\n      &lt;UnitCost currency=&quot;USD&quot;&gt;0.10&lt;/UnitCost&gt;\n      &lt;Quantity&gt;10&lt;/Quantity&gt;\n&lt;/p:Part&gt;\n\nSuppose that the client decides that he/she wants to &quot;add this to\nhis/her shopping cart&quot;.  To provide this capability Parts Depot may\nprovide another element &lt;AddToCart&gt; when it returns detailed part\ninformation.  Thus, instead of the above XML document the client would\nreceive this:\n\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;p:Part xmlns:p=&quot;http://www.parts-depot.com&quot;   \n        xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;Part-ID&gt;00345&lt;/Part-ID&gt;\n      &lt;Name&gt;Widget-A&lt;/Name&gt;\n      &lt;Description&gt;\n          This part is used within the frap assembly\n      &lt;/Description&gt;\n      &lt;Specification\nxlink:href=&quot;http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/00345/specification&quot;/&gt;\n      &lt;UnitCost currency=&quot;USD&quot;&gt;0.10&lt;/UnitCost&gt;\n      &lt;Quantity&gt;10&lt;/Quantity&gt;\n      &lt;AddToCart href=&quot;http://parts-depot.com/parts/00345/add-to-cart&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/p:Part&gt;\n\nNote the last element, &lt;AddToCart href=&quot;...&quot;/&gt;.  The URL in the href\nattribute:\n\n    http://parts-depot.com/parts/00345/add-to-cart\n\nclearly contains a verb, add-to-cart.\n\nI have a couple of thoughts about this design:\n\n1. If the HTTP method for the above URL is GET then it is violating the\nprinciple that all GETs should be side-effect free.\n\n2. One of the principles of REST is that the client should maintain\nhis/her own state.  The server should not do so.  The above approach has\nthe server maintaining state about the client.\n\nHere&#39;s an alternative solution.  The client creates a Purchase Order\n(PO) which identifies the parts he/she is interested in purchasing. \nWhen the client finds a part that he/she is interested in, the client\nwill add that part number to the PO.  When the client is ready he/she\nsubmits the PO.  Some things to note:\n\n1. The PO represents the &quot;shopping cart&quot;.\n\n2. The PO is composed on the client side, not the server side.\n\nThis second design seems to be more in the spirit of REST.\n\nThose are the two ways that I see for implementing the purchase parts\nWeb service.  Are there other (better) ways?  Any comments?  /Roger\n\n\n"}}
