The client does not need a\n&gt; &gt; priori knowledge of the server URI space. It constructs (some\n&gt; &gt; parts of) a URI, but:\n&gt; \n&gt; A computation is needed to create the link. &quot;Complex&quot; is a word\n&gt; game I don&#39;t buy into here; on that basis EPRs are complex too.\n\nYeah, that wording was mistaken.\n\n&gt; &gt; It does so based on directions provided to it within a\n&gt; &gt; representation returned from the server (and according to the\n&gt; &gt; rules for query strings).\n&gt; \n&gt; Right, I need a preprocessor. I&#39;m not getting how a form is\n&gt; only seemingly opaque.\n\nI was saying it is only seemingly transparent, not seemingly\nopaque.\n\nBut what I should have been saying is that it is partially\ntransparent.\n\nBut again, the key point is that the transparency is granted by a\ndescription provided in a representation retrieved from the\nserver.\n\nMy key argument in that mail (and if I’m not mistaken you didn’t\naddress this at all) is that the client does not have a priori\nknowledge of the server URI space. It knows how to construct such\nURIs only because the server publishes information about what it\nwill accept in an agreed-upon format.\n\n&gt; If you&#39;re saying it depends on the media type, then that&#39;s\n&gt; fine, but stronger claims about URI opacity need to be made\n&gt; contingent on that. We haven&#39;t even talked about URI templates\n&gt; yet.\n\nThey’re not qualitatively different from forms.\n\n&gt; &gt; Therefore, this is still representational state transfer.\n&gt; &gt; This is what Roy’s recent message boils down to:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * Roy T. Fielding &lt;fielding@...&gt; [2007-05-10 18:00]:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is essential to eliminate the coupling between client\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and server. If the application doesn&#39;t follow the workflow\n&gt; &gt; &gt; defined by the representations that are received, then the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; application isn&#39;t using the REST style. Not even a little\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bit. It is using RPC plus streaming, with a rather\n&gt; &gt; &gt; inefficient syntax, and the client will break each time the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; server&#39;s application evolves because the client must be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; anticipating the server&#39;s state based on its own\n&gt; &gt; &gt; assumptions. In other words, the two are coupled by their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; original design.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In a sense, forms are just a compression scheme. They can be\n&gt; &gt; used to express an infinite amount of links with a single\n&gt; &gt; description that encompasses all of them. But\n&gt; &gt; representational state transfer is still happening because\n&gt; &gt; such a manifold link must still be provided by the server to\n&gt; &gt; the client inside a representation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry, but I suspect this ends up with an infinite tape.\n\nCome again?\n\nIn this paragraph, I wasn’t saying anything different from the\nkey argument above. I admit that it’s probably hard to follow\nthat this is just another version of the same concept if you’re\nnot me in that moment of time. Sorry.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
