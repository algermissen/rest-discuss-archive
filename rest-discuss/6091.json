I think \n&gt; we have different definitions of the word.  You&#39;re talking about \n&gt; something technical, but I&#39;m talking about the subjective experience of \n&gt; the user.\n\nRight. I&#39;m using a term defined within the scope of webapp\narchitecture.\n\n\n\n&gt; For example, if I&#39;m playing chess online, each game is a session.  I \n&gt; might make a move today, and come back tomorrow, and make another move.  \n&gt; Same session.  I can simultaneously be playing another game with someone \n&gt; else in another browser window, and that&#39;s another session.\n\nGotcha. That is a more general understanding of the word I think.\n\nA webapp &quot;session&quot; is like that but it implies certain, non-resource,\nsemantics:\n\n- there&#39;s a cookie carrying the session id\n- there&#39;s a bunch of data attached to the session on the server\n\n\nIn your more general understanding there is no reason why resources\ncould not model a session. Your chess game for example, might have a\nresource called:\n\n  http://chess/games/lyle/63e7e7\n\nwhich would be a particular game you were playing. The resource would\ncapture the state of the game, perhaps the moves that had been played\nsince the beginning or the current state of the board.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
