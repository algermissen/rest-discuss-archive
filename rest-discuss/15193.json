I appreciate the time you spent to provide me\n&gt; =\r\nwith good suggestions.\n&gt;\n&gt; I see your point about the overall presentation.=\r\n This short blog post\n&gt; skips quite a bit when attempting to educate users =\r\non the basics of\n&gt; REST. Also, I received feedback from others on the possi=\r\nbility that\n&gt; this particular posting doesn&#39;t do enough to clear up the iss=\r\nue of\n&gt; RPC-like approaches to implementing web interfaces. In fact, a long=\r\ner\n&gt; draft of this material included an additional section directly\n&gt; addre=\r\nssing typical RPC ways to express the service. I actually have an\n&gt; example=\r\n SOAP implementation and an example RPC-over-HTTP\n&gt; implementation, but ski=\r\npped that in the blog as it too long for this\n&gt; medium.\n&gt;\n&gt; Again, thanks f=\r\nor the helpful feedback and suggestions.\n&gt;\n&gt; mca\n&gt; http://amundsen.com/blog=\r\n/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Thu, Apr 8, 2010 at 09:05, William Martinez Pomares\n&gt; &lt;wmart=\r\ninez@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Ok Mike.\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve read it and it seems a very s=\r\nimple example that shows the important, core aspects of media type definiti=\r\non. I also noticed you were following Roy&#39;s rant guide (I mean, the guide i=\r\nn the rant :D ).\n&gt;&gt; BTW, Antonio&#39;s point about multi protocols should be di=\r\nscussed a little bit in another comment.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But now on this one: I read =\r\nit and was able to understand the intention, although it was not explicit. =\r\nIf I change my REST knowledge, reducing it to a that of an RPC developer th=\r\nat knows REST is good and his boss told him to implement, quick and dirty, =\r\na REST API, I may have problems. I will be probably driven to think I&#39;m def=\r\nining a mapping for my RPC calls.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So, my suggestion (bear with me as =\r\nI treat all people as my university students) is to introduce the article b=\r\ny explaining a RESTSFull API is designed not by defining the procedures to =\r\ncall on a data element, but by defining a data element representation that =\r\nhas such and such attributes to allow such and such REST constrains.\n&gt;&gt; The=\r\nn go on saying that regular RPC approach would be to define that list of op=\r\nerations you have there. Next, explain that your first step would be to def=\r\nine the resource (entity and semantics), and then define a representation (=\r\na media type) that will help user-agents work with that resource. Make clea=\r\nr that the actual List (resource) is implemented in the server in whatever =\r\nform the designer wants: it may be a table in a database, an in memory arra=\r\ny, a Vector, even a HashTable of some sort, or a hierarchical filesystem st=\r\nructure, you imagine. Client does not care, it receives the representation/=\r\nmedia type your are defining. That is because regular developer may thing t=\r\nhe list SHOULD be stored in the server as an XML like the one you post, in =\r\nother words, you are defining the actual storage format. Again, foresee con=\r\nfusion and be defensive.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I wont go on with the rest of the article, b=\r\nut that would be my style. Long, slow description making special emphasis o=\r\nn some concepts that may be confusing to the reader. For instance, when map=\r\nping the protocol, be clear you are not mapping the operations in the begin=\r\nning to those of the protocol (making the protocol your PRC implementor), b=\r\nut using the protocol semantics to manipulate the resource, getting similar=\r\n results as the operations above, and stating that the actual manipulation =\r\nmay be different altogether.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Of course, you have your style, and the =\r\napproach of the article is great (show by doing), but our discussion about =\r\nperceptions of the meaning of some concepts makes me carefully trying not t=\r\no confuse the reader.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Cheers!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; William Martinez.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- In=\r\n rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, mike amundsen &lt;mamund@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;=\r\nve posted a blog entry labeled &quot;A RESTful Hypermedia API in Three\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Easy =\r\nSteps&quot;[1].
