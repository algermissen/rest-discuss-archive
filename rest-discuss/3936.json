It looks like you have\n&gt; some SUDS server that can basically answer questions about\n&gt; syntax, but if I was looking for a resource in a serious way, I\n&gt; would care more initially about the semantics, not the syntax, and\n&gt; I don&#39;t see how you&#39;ve addressed that (not meaning to sound as\n&gt; if I think you should, mind you).\n\nIt&#39;s true that I haven&#39;t directly addressed semantics.  However, there are\nvarious levels of semantic discovery.  For instance, in the case of the blog\nexample, if I POST a SUDS document to the URI of the entry resource:\n\n&lt;suds&gt;\n    &lt;sud uri=&quot;&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;returns http-method=&quot;POST&quot; conent-type=&quot;application/atom+xml&quot;/&gt;\n    &lt;/sud&gt;\n&lt;/suds&gt;\n\nand I get back\n\n&lt;suds&gt;\n    &lt;sud uri=&quot;http://www.example.com/sudsIsTheFuture.comments&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;returns http-method=&quot;POST&quot; conent-type=&quot;application/atom+xml&quot;/&gt;\n    &lt;/sud&gt;\n&lt;/suds&gt;\n\nwhat more needs to be known?  The semantics are wrapped up in the\ncontent-type, http-method, and the relationship to the resource that\nprocessed the SUDS request.  Now, I am not saying this is sufficient for all\nneeds.  I do believe, however, that it&#39;s a goog start.  Since the SUDS is\nxml-based, it is also possible to extend the request to allow for additional\ncriteria.  Obviously, the SUDS more or less punts on this to avoid getting\nbogged down in the endless possibilities...\n\n&gt; Also, I&#39;m assuming this is a central registry kind of thing, as\n&gt; opposed to a metadata service provided by SUDSY resources\n&gt; generally.  Because instead of doing content negotiation on a\n&gt; selected resource, it points you to a resource that fits the syntactic\n&gt; requirement, right?\n\nNo, I was thinking about SUDSy resources, though I don&#39;t see why a central\nregistry couldn&#39;t be done.  The idea would be to enhance existing resources\nto include this functionality.  So, instead of just having a blog entry\nresource, you have a blog entry resource capable of processing SUDS\ndocuments.\n\nSo, does this clear any of it up, or make things worse?  :)\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
