One approach to do this is to first POST\n&gt; the media data (and have the server return the created entry with the\n&gt; link to the uploaded media data) and then to update the metadata with\n&gt; a PUT on the entry.\n&gt; (That is the approach Atom is taking, at least in APP v08[1])\n&gt; \n&gt; What if the legacy system requires the creation and metadata\n&gt; assignment be done as an atomic operation, IOW if the entry cannot be\n&gt; created in the absence of the metadata?\n\nForm multipart with cid URLs. I&#39;ve done this before. It&#39;ll work fine as \nlong as the server can deconstruct the multipart correctly and your \ninternal code can handle partially failures so that the client gets a \nclean &quot;all or nothing went&quot; response. The latter is trickier if you&#39;re \ngoing to send batches of meta+media in a single request.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
