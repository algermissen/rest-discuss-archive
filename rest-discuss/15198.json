The existence of cli=\r\nents that support a markup language drives the development of services that=\r\n represent their resources in that language in order to reach those clients=\r\n.\n\nSerendipitous re-use tends to come from the declarative nature of markup=\r\n languages that, via the principle of least power, enables secondary client=\r\ns (e.g. spiders) to also be driven by the markup language designed around t=\r\nhe primary client.\n\nThe primary client can also drive the behavior of the s=\r\necondary clients. For example, Google&#39;s spider isn&#39;t just about indexing th=\r\ne data in web pages. It must prioritize the data presented to users when th=\r\ney view a page in the browser. If &quot;invisible&quot; data (e.g. meta-data or even =\r\ndata hidden via CSS) was given the same priority as visible data, then the =\r\nservice would be less valuable to its users. Google isn&#39;t indexing the brow=\r\nser input -- it is indexing the browser output (to your screen). The declar=\r\native nature of HTML makes it easy to derive output from input.\n\nThe single=\r\n biggest flaw in most REST system design today is that markup languages are=\r\n being designed around the service&#39;s view of the data. The markup should be=\r\n a declarative program for the client -- saying &quot;what&quot; the client does with=\r\n the data rather than &quot;how&quot; it does it. Folks are using markup to denote &quot;w=\r\nhat&quot; the data means, but to the service rather than the client. The clients=\r\n then have to be designed around the service semantics -- this binds them t=\r\no the service just as much as RPC does.\n\nI&#39;ve been saying for years ( http:=\r\n//tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/8411 ) that with REST, t=\r\nhe API is in the client. The markup is a declarative program written to tha=\r\nt API --  and being declarative means it can be adapted to other APIs. The =\r\nscripts are optional imperative programs to fill in the feature gaps of the=\r\n markup language. Content negotiation allows a single service to use other =\r\nmarkup languages to target other sets of APIs. If you design your markup la=\r\nnguages around this line of reasoning, you will get a lot more mileage out =\r\nof them.\n\nAndrew\n\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Jan Algermissen &lt;al=\r\ngermissen1971@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; On Apr 9, 2010, at 11:26 AM, Jan Algermiss=\r\nen wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think it is helpful to view server side development=\r\n as exposing server-component managed (business-) state for serendipitous c=\r\nonsumptions instead of viewing it as providing an &#39;application programmer&#39;s=\r\n interface&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Server side development should not be driven by the quest=\r\nion &#39;how should clients interact with this service?&#39; but focus on exposing =\r\nthe server-side system in a way that maximizes the serendipitous reuse of i=\r\nts state and capabilities.\n&gt; \n&gt; And (maybe) server side maintenance should =\r\nexplicitly included the activity of constantly aiming to refine the server =\r\nto enhance its possible reuse. \n&gt; \n&gt; Jan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; A nice side effect of this view is that it immediately becomes evident th=\r\nat there cannot be any client side coding before specific media types have =\r\nbeen decided upon.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jan\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ------------------------=\r\n-----------\n&gt; &gt; Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n&gt; &gt; NORD Software Consulting\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Mail: algermissen@...\n&gt; &gt; Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n&gt; &gt; Work=\r\n: http://www.nordsc.com/\n&gt; &gt; -----------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo=\r\n!
