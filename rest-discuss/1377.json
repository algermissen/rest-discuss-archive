How the resource is\nimplemented is encapsulated.  When a client issues an HTTP GET the\nclient receives a representation of the resource.  Correct?\n\nI am not clear on what the REST abstraction is of an HTTP POST, PUT or\nDELETE.  Is this the intended abstraction for an HTTP POST: the client\nsends to the resource a partial representation of the resource, which it\nexpects the resource to incorporate into itself.  Is that the REST\nabstraction for an HTTP POST?\n\nAnd what is the abstraction with an HTTP PUT?  Is it that the client\nsends to the resource a new, complete representation of the resource\nwhich it expects the resource to replace itself with?  \n\nIs the abstraction for an HTTP DELETE that the resource should\ncompletely delete itself?\n\nIn the three cases (POST, PUT, DELETE) it seems like the client is\nasking the resource to commit partial or complete suicide for the sake\nof the client&#39;s new representation.  That doesn&#39;t seem to be a very\nreasonable thing to ask of a resource.   /Roger\n\n\n"}}
