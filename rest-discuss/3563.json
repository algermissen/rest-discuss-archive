How do you create a container?\n&gt;&gt;  Do we use the WebDAV MKCOL method?\n&gt;&gt;  Do we PUT a content-type that is, by definition,\n&gt;&gt;   a container e.g. text/xml+rss or multipart/mixed?\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Theoretically, you simply PUT something that needs containment,\n&gt;as evidenced by the slash in the path.  However, most webdav\n&gt;implementers believed that a collection should exist prior to\n&gt;a PUT within it, since that makes it easier to catch user mistakes\n&gt;such as mistyping a long URI.  Hence, MKCOL.\n&gt;\n&gt;REST will happily accept either alternative, providing that the\n&gt;method is standardized (has the same meaning) for all resources\n&gt;(even if some may not allow it).\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nBut does HTTP happily accept either alternative?  Or does HTTP \nstandarize on one or the other method?\n\n[...]\n\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;6. How do you DELETE only the contents of a container?\n&gt;&gt;  My answer: Either iterate through the contents\n&gt;&gt;  and DELETE individually or DELETE the container\n&gt;&gt;  and then create it again but then see #1\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;If you delete the container, it may have adverse effects on other\n&gt;links.  For example, if the server automatically maintains links,\n&gt;then you should not delete the container unless you want all of\n&gt;those links to go away.  So, delete each resource individually.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nWhat do you mean by &quot;the server automatically maintains links?&quot;\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n\n"}}
