I \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t call that &quot;hardly anybody&quot;.\n\nBut the point of REST is developers implementing it for their\napplications... not app server developers providing it.\n\nThese are the same people who write little SOAP backends and so\nforth... NOT experienced hackers who write webservers.\n\n\n&gt; Note that MOVE is atomic in that if it succeeds, the source URI \n&gt; shouldn&#39;t be mapped anymore. However, there is no inherent guarantee \n&gt; that applying MOVE to a collection will be able to move all children.\n&gt;\n&gt; Finally, if for some reason a server fails during a MOVE operation in a \n&gt; way that it can&#39;t undo parts of the actions, it will signal a 5xx status \n&gt; code.\n\nYes. I understand that. But I know a lot of developers who write\nwebservices but who don&#39;t know what &quot;atomic&quot; means.\n\nThey&#39;re not bad... they just don&#39;t know that.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
