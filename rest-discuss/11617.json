This happens \n&gt; to be a particular English-language text/plain document in the encoding \n&gt; us-ascii. It is one of the rules of RFCs that this document has a \n&gt; normative status that does not apply to other plausible representations \n&gt; of the RFC.\n&gt;\n&gt; There could be other English language text/plain;charset=us-ascii \n&gt; documents that are not normative (say, with added commentary). Different \n&gt; resource.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is not a matter of content-negotiation. The normative version of any \n&gt; RFC refers to an actual bunch of 1s and 0s.\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n\n\nWhat you&#39;re saying isn&#39;t making that much sense; if it is a different \nresource.. it is a different resource. How is your observation helpful \nto this discussion? At best, it&#39;s just a long-winded explanation of \nwhere something that seems like it could a representation is actually a \nresource. You&#39;re describing something as a representation.. and then \ncriticising it for not being a resource.. Maybe you got it wrong in the \nfirst place?\n\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not saying \n&gt;&gt; you can&#39;t do it your way, I&#39;d just rather do it mine because it seems to \n&gt;&gt; makes a lot more sense.\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; You can&#39;t do it your way because it makes absolutely no sense.\n&gt;   \n\nIt makes no sense to use Uniform Resource Identifiers to identify \nresources, and then use HTTP content negotiation to negotiate the \ncontent of that resource?\n\n&gt; If the way to refer to the normative version of an RFC is to use a \n&gt; combination of a URI and an accept header (and an accept-language \n&gt; header, there will only be one normative language version). Then no \n&gt; technology apart from HTML5 will be able to reference the normative \n&gt; version of an RFC.\n&gt;   \n\nNo technology...? Apart from every HTTP client capable of modifying its \nheaders to appropriately construct a request? Most clients don&#39;t need to \nchange their headers from default anyway because the content types they \n(and therefore their users aswell) have preference for are fixed - \nbrowsers are supposed to support all content-types beyond their default \npreference is obviously HTML, but in the context of an application this \nneeds to be over-ridden (unless you use URIs for content negotiation \nbecause the mechanism doesn&#39;t exist - note; that&#39;s not an argument for \nusing URIs to do this, it&#39;s just pointing out why that is the current \nmethod).\n\nYou seem to have a misconception that every URI must be accessed via the \nbrowser, that is the only way I can currently make sense of your position.\n\n&gt; There are other cases of this. Here in Ireland English is &quot;an official \n&gt; language&quot; and the language most commonly spoken, but Irish is &quot;the \n&gt; official language&quot;. Laws are generally discussed in English, but the \n&gt; normative version of any statute, ordinance or constitutional amendment \n&gt; is the Irish-language version.\n&gt;\n&gt; Its generally true of other jurisdictions as well that only one, or a \n&gt; small subset, of translations of a law are normative, but the Irish case \n&gt; is significant in this regard because the language most obviously used \n&gt; (people are working with Accept-Language: en) is different to the \n&gt; normative one. Do you not see how this makes the &quot;Bunreacht na hÉireann \n&gt; as gaeilge&quot; a different resource to &quot;Bunreacht na hÉireann&quot;?\n&gt;   \n\nYes - A different resource, it&#39;s not a different representation. The \ncomplexities of Irish dialect are interesting, but they&#39;re hardly \nrelevant to this discussion - what is your point here exactly?\n\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; Needlessly doing URI-based content negotiation \n&gt;&gt; and creating multiple URIs for the same resource seems to imply that \n&gt;&gt; separating the concepts of resources and representations is not only \n&gt;&gt; unnecessary - but undesirable.\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; Identifying multiple things seems to indicate that they are multiple things.\n&gt;   \n\nYes; multiple *representations* of *one* resource.\n\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; And by your logic - only &quot;representations \n&gt;&gt; we don&#39;t care about should be made available via HTTP conneg, every \n&gt;&gt; important representation should be it&#39;s own resource&quot;. It just doesn&#39;t \n&gt;&gt; make any sense and you don&#39;t provide any substantial rationale for your \n&gt;&gt; opinion either, you just state it.\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; It depends on what you mean by &quot;important representation&quot;. If you are \n&gt; deeming to talk about a representation its already become a resource. \n&gt; It&#39;s a thing, it&#39;s not a shadow.\n&gt;   \n\nWell then why bother making the distinction between resource and \nrepresentation?\n\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; Could please explain why you feel that HTTP content negotiation \n&gt;&gt; undermines content negotiation.\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; HTML content negotiation (&quot;content dictation&quot; would be a more accurate \n&gt; term) undermines HTTP content negotiation.\n&gt;   \n\nIt&#39;s not HTML content negotiation, HTML doesn&#39;t do anything it&#39;s just a \nmarkup language.\n\nIt&#39;s telling a browser how to negotiate content using HTTP from a \nparticular URI for a given link in an HTML GUI.\n\nThat&#39;s not undermining HTTP content negotiation, quite the opposite.\n\nUndermining HTTP content negotiation would be taking advantage of a \nbrowser&#39;s catch all &#39;*/*&#39; in its default Accept header, and &#39;content \ndictating&#39; the representation in the URI - which is exactly the method \nyou are promoting.\n\nThere&#39;s 3 different types of content negotiation identified in this \ndocument:\n\nhttp://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec12.html\n\nI&#39;m suggesting that these can all be achieved using HTTP conneg and \nusing URIs just as they were intended; to identify resources. The only \nway this will work is if markup can provide browsers with a way of \nachieving agent-driven *HTTP* content negotiation and not the current \nagent-driven URI-based content negotiation. This is not possible \npresently because there is no mechanism in markup to indicate the \nappropriate HTTP conneg headers for a request.\n&gt; You are proposing to do away with content negotiation because we use the \n&gt; the Accept header to perform it, which your proposal is hi-jacking to \n&gt; serve as part of an identifier.\n&gt;\n&gt; What do we use to perform content-negotiation?\n&gt;   \n\nWhat?\n\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; How are intermediaries and caches supposed to know whether a PUT to \n&gt;&gt; /document.xml means that changes have been made to /document.json, or \n&gt;&gt; /document.pdf ?\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; Why are they supposed to care? Either staleness in this regard is okay \n&gt; (and the cache-related headers say so) or they will need to re-check \n&gt; (and the cache-related headers say so) and receive a 200 rather than a 304.\n&gt;\n&gt; If this were a problem then how would they also know that a PUT to \n&gt; /document.xml also changes / (because / contains a list of documents) \n&gt; and /users/1234 (because this contains a list of documents recently \n&gt; changed by /users/1234) and /users/1234/documents (because this contains \n&gt; a list of all documents changed by /users/1234) and /search?q=sumpsimus \n&gt; (because /document.xml now contains the word &quot;sumpsimus&quot; but it hadn&#39;t \n&gt; before) and /search?q=mumpsimus (because /document.xml now doesn&#39;t \n&gt; contain the word &quot;mumpsiums&quot; but had before) and /documents/recent and \n&gt; /document.rdf (which contains Dublin Core and FOAF metadata \n&gt; automatically generated from processing /document.xml) and \n&gt; /documents.rdf (which contains the same for all documents in a single \n&gt; RDF file), /users/2341/watchlist (because criteria have indicated user \n&gt; 2341 is likely to find this document of interest in some way) and /xe2s3 \n&gt; (&quot;another department put that in for their uses, we&#39;re agnostic to \n&gt; whatever its doing&quot;) /sitemap.xml, /docs.kml and so on?\n&gt;   \n\nHATEOAS ?\n\n&gt; For that matter. How are they even going to know that a PUT to \n&gt; /document.xml that didn&#39;t go through them means that /document.xml has \n&gt; changed?\n&gt;   \nIf the PUT didn&#39;t &#39;go through&#39; them; then they aren&#39;t an intermediary, \nare they?\n\nRegards,\nMike\n\n\n"}}
