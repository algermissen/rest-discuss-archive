It feels\n&gt; like we loop through this periodically on this\n&gt; list but never resolve it generically.  Here are\n&gt; the questions that should be in the FAQ (I don&#39;t\n&gt; know the answers).\n\nWell, for one, it is REST -- not ReST.  I like uniformity in some\nthings.\n\n&gt; 1. How do you create a container?\n&gt;   Do we use the WebDAV MKCOL method?\n&gt;   Do we PUT a content-type that is, by definition,\n&gt;    a container e.g. text/xml+rss or multipart/mixed?\n\nTheoretically, you simply PUT something that needs containment,\nas evidenced by the slash in the path.  However, most webdav\nimplementers believed that a collection should exist prior to\na PUT within it, since that makes it easier to catch user mistakes\nsuch as mistyping a long URI.  Hence, MKCOL.\n\nREST will happily accept either alternative, providing that the\nmethod is standardized (has the same meaning) for all resources\n(even if some may not allow it).\n\n&gt; 2. How do we add things to the container?\n&gt;   Do we rely on directory structure and just do\n&gt;    a PUT /collection/item?\n\nIf you know that item os the name you want, yes.\n\n&gt;   Do we POST /collection and get back a 201 CREATED?\n\nIf you don&#39;t know what the name should be, yes.\n\n&gt; 3. How do we specify the order of items in a collection?\n&gt;   If we do this by POSTing to the collection, how\n&gt;   do we disambiguate between an add-to-collection\n&gt;   POST and an &quot;order-by&quot; POST.\n\nOrder is a property of the collection representation.\n\n&gt; 4. How do you DELETE a non-empty container and its contents?\n&gt;   My answer: DELETE /container\n\nThat is certainly how the user agent would express the semantic.\nThe server might tell you to delete the children first.\n\n&gt; 5. How do you DELETE a non-empty container and not\n&gt;   its contents?\n&gt;   My answer: Make it a container of links (see #4)\n\nMove the contents first.\n\n&gt; 6. How do you DELETE only the contents of a container?\n&gt;   My answer: Either iterate through the contents\n&gt;   and DELETE individually or DELETE the container\n&gt;   and then create it again but then see #1\n\nIf you delete the container, it may have adverse effects on other\nlinks.  For example, if the server automatically maintains links,\nthen you should not delete the container unless you want all of\nthose links to go away.  So, delete each resource individually.\n\nBTW, why do you switch from &quot;collection&quot; to &quot;container&quot;?\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
