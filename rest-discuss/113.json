The server could return\na list of message references - which would interestingly look a lot like a\nfile listing - or it could return the messages themselves. You&#39;d probably\nwant to use an Accept header to indicate which representation you want.\n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Paul Prescod&quot; &lt;paul@...&gt;\n\n\n&gt; I&#39;d like opinions on how the client indicates to the server that it is\n&gt; asking for notifications. I think I&#39;ve seen the following options\n&gt; discussed here:\n&gt;\n&gt;  1. through a new method\n&gt;\n&gt; WATCH /blah/blah\n&gt;\n&gt;  2. through the existence of a new header in a POST\n&gt;\n&gt; Reply-to: http://....\n&gt;\n&gt;  3. through a form parameter in a POST\n&gt;\n&gt; &reply-to=http://....\n&gt;\n&gt;  4. through a POST of a content type\n&gt;\n&gt; Content-type: application/www-notification-request\n&gt;\n&gt;  5. The application could merely &quot;know&quot; that when a POST is made to a\n&gt; particular URI that the request is for a notification.\n&gt;\n&gt; I guess I prefer 2, the reply-to header. Lucas, why do your examples use\n&gt; 3? I would rather leave the POST body completely in the domain of the\n&gt; application because what if the application wants to pass XML or\n&gt; graphics as the body?\n&gt;\n&gt;  Paul Prescod\n&gt;\n\n"}}
