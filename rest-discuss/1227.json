I&#39;m still trying to \nfollow the implications, thus the next question...\n\n&gt; &gt; How far do you think this idea could be pushed?\n&gt; \n&gt; Hard to say. I think that the whole web services world needs to \nfigure\n&gt; out what is going to happen with transactions (or should clients \njust\n&gt; unroll actions?). If real transactions end up being necessary for \nweb\n&gt; services then I guess a transaction is a kind of session...\n\nFor business purposes, some kind of transactions are necessary.\nThey are not database transactions, but for business state alignment.\nThey wrap common business protocols:  good example, offer-acceptance \nis the business protocol for contract (order) formation.\nBoth trading partners must agree on whether the offer was accepted or \nnot.  \nAcceptance should be explicit:  i.e. non-repudiable messages from \neach party that irrevocably connect acceptance to offer.  \nThe acceptance message may take some time, but not forever.\nTime constraints must apply.\n\nSo I&#39;m thinking, could this kind of business-state-alignment \ntransaction be made into a resource itself - maybe a sub-resource of \nthe Order?\n\n&gt; &gt; What are the drawbacks?\n&gt; \n&gt; If you can&#39;t use a session ID to refer to a large body of shared \ncontext\n&gt; then you may end up sending more information in each message to\n&gt; establish context. \n\nIf the transaction is a resource, you will send messages to the \ntransaction.  (Does that make sense?)\n\n&gt; Also resource cleanup typically will not happen\n&gt; automatically when a &quot;session ends&quot; as it might in a stateful \nprotocol.\n\nIf a business transaction is made into a Web resource, what needs to \nbe cleaned up?  The transaction resources should be persistent, in \nsome cases for years.  If the transaction times out before a \nresponse, it fails (i.e. its state is &quot;failed&quot;).\n\n(I must be missing something here.  Making this stuff all into Web \nresources seems so much simpler to me that somebody must have already \ntried and rejected it before they adopted cookies et al.  Mustn&#39;t \nthey?)\n\n\n"}}
