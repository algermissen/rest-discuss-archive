You just send\nthe purchase order in a request and get the purchase order acknowledgement\nin the response. The problem with this is that the idea that you are sending\ndocuments with HTTP is incorrect. A /messaging/ protocol would be\nappropriate to send documents with. For HTTP, what you are sending are\nmessages /about a resource/.\nA business protocol is an abstract conceptual thing - with concepts like\npurchase order, invoice, etc. Resources are also abstract conceptual\nthings - they can represent anything, even things /before/ they actually\n&#39;exist&#39;.\n\nWhen you use HTTP to implement business protocols, the messages you send\nwill be about resources that you and your partners have agreed are necessary\nin order to conduct business. The HTTP message will be /about/ a purchase\norder, it won&#39;t /be/ a purchase order.\nFor example, a business protocol may specify that a PO has a PO-ACK to\nconfirm its receipt and an Invoice to request payment (ignoring the\nrole-dependent document naming issues). Rather than describe who sends what\nand when, an HTTP based business protocol would describe what documents (and\nother pieces) are resources and who is responsible for creating them and\nwhat operations are legal at certain points in the transaction. With this\napproach the resource can have an identifier regardless of how many messages\nhave been exchanged and the resource can &#39;exist&#39; independent of the exchange\nof content.\n\nFor example, a big partner could pre-allocate a range of document IDs for\ntheir small partners and over time these would be echoed back to the big\npartner - the resource identifier exists and is valid to talk about and\nmessage about independent of any exchange of content.\n\nI have a growing sense that systems built on REST principles tend to not\nlook like document messaging systems - you tend to interact with documents,\nrather than send and receive documents (where &#39;document&#39; is a higher level\nconcept like purchase order, etc.).\n\nAnyway... just some thoughts.\n\n\n\n"}}
