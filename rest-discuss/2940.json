In regular usage of a\n&gt; Java SOA toolkit you would take one object and create a WSDL doc from\n&gt; it.  The WSDL doc is a single service.  I would say that means one\n&gt; service represents one object.\n\nPerhaps we should clarify whether we are talking &#39;object&#39;, &#39;class&#39; or what.\nWhen you use the term &#39;object&#39; when talking about Java, I think of it as an\ninstance.\nSo &quot;...many objects are encapsulated into a single service. And you do\ndiscovery on the service, not the objects.&quot; probably uses the term &#39;object&#39;\nto mean &#39;instance&#39;.\nI hope this clarifies things.\n\nAs a note, this discussion is interesting because I see REST as being an\n&#39;instance&#39; heavy approach, whereas many OO languages have &#39;class&#39; and\n&#39;instance&#39; as primary concepts.\n\n\n"}}
