On the worldos.com site 99% of\nbandwidth was spiders downloading the complete tarball, which was a pain\nin the ass for my provider, who is a decent guy with not a lot of money.\nI was happy to be able to use robots.txt as a courtesy to him.\n\nNote that I&#39;m not arguing about what you put in HttpEvents, which is none\nof my business.\n\n&gt; robots.txt is similar but too different to be directly reused in my\n&gt; opinion. The one is about crawlers. The other is about subscribers. I\n&gt; don&#39;t think that they are the same...\n&gt;\n&gt;  Paul Prescod\n\nWell, they&#39;re both bots that are too dumb to know the difference.\n\n\n"}}
