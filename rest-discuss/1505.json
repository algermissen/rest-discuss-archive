So,\n&gt; REST isn&#39;t about reducing the &quot;verbs&quot; and making as many things &quot;nouns&quot;\n&gt; as\n&gt; possible, but about having an universal addressing and access mechanism.\n\nIt&#39;s both.  You can&#39;t have one and not the other; they come together.\nI strongly agree with Roger&#39;s point.\n\n&gt; 6. Minimize the use of query strings.  For example:\n&gt; \n&gt;     Prefer:\n&gt;          http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/00345\n&gt;     Over: \n&gt;          http://www.parts-depot.com/parts?part-id=00345\n&gt; \n&gt; Rationale: it&#39;s easier for Web intermedaries such as proxy servers to\n&gt; evaluate a request when it doesn&#39;t need to parse a query string.\n\nI&#39;ll comment on this point while I&#39;m here ...\n\nI don&#39;t think you need to minimize the use of query strings.  They&#39;re\ngood and fine.  What you might be trying to say is that non-transient\nresources should have a &quot;principal&quot; URI that does not include a query\nstring.  For example, a query returning multiple employees probably\ndoesn&#39;t need one, but one for an individual employee probably does.  The\nreason I think this is a good idea is that it allows for later\ndecomposition of these resources (i.e. treat as containers for composite\nstate).\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
