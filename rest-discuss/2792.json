One answer is that because part of /Subscriptions\n&gt; is out of bounds of that user, the entire resource is &quot;Unauthorized&quot;.\n&gt; Another answer is that the representation given to a user is filtered,\nbased\n&gt; on his authenticated identity.  In that case, two different users\n&gt; accessing /Subscriptions via GET will see disjoint subsets of the\n&gt; resource.  By extension, an entire resource schema (application) may\n&gt; be implicitly constrained by the security properties of the access.\n&gt;\n&gt; What does REST have to say about this, if anything?\n&gt;\n\nCool... filtered views. Good question.\nMy guess is that with HTTP you might be able to indicate how the response\nwas dependent on the request - I think the &#39;vary&#39; header is used for that.\nSo you could say that the response varies according to the auth header. This\nis useful for caching, etc. It essentially creates a &#39;meta-key&#39; or\n&#39;meta-identifier&#39; that can be used to a small degree as an identifier for\nthe transient representations.\n\n\n"}}
