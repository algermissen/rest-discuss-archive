Alexander Jacobson&quot; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;...\n&gt; \n&gt; In any case, RFC822 says that every mail message\n&gt; should have a globally unique identifier\n&gt; (message-id) and that replies should have\n&gt; &quot;in-reply-to: message-id&quot; in their headers.\n\nHow do I dereference those identifiers? If I can&#39;t put an identifier in\na browser URL bar and expect to get some set of bytes back then I don&#39;t\npersonally think it is really REST-y. But then REST is just a philosophy\nso there will be differences of opinion on that. I would say that\nmessage-id&#39;s should be HTTP URLs that dereference to the message\ncontents and that ACLs should be used to say who can and cannot see it.\nArchives of messages (e.g. egroups) could add a header\n\norig-message-url: http:// ....\n\nI&#39;m just making this up as I go along. I&#39;m not claiming to be a REST\nguru.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; As I said before, in MIME-RPC, any MIME transport\n&gt; is the transport (HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, IMAP, etc).\n&gt; The wire format is a MIME envelope wrapped\n&gt; around whatever makes the most sense for your\n&gt; application (e.g. GIF, JPEG, or Flash rather than\n&gt; SVG).\n&gt; \n&gt; The last one is important.  XML does not easily\n&gt; allow delivery of multiple XML documents or other\n&gt; opaque data types like graphics or MSOffice files.\n&gt; MIME is designed to do just that.\n\nIt is easy to set up an HREF from an XML document to a MIME. I don&#39;t\nknow whether SOAP does it intelligently or not. In Python it would take\nme a couple of lines to get from an HREF to a MIME part so I don&#39;t know\nwhat MIME-RPC adds.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; My question is What is REST?  What does it add?\n&gt; There seems to be no definition only ostensive\n&gt; descriptions.  \n\nREST is the architecture of the web. What does it add? The Web. If you\nuse the Web in the way it was designed then you get applications that\nare easier to maintain, scales better and generally works better. In\nyour MIME-RPC examples you use POST to do a getStateName. I know you&#39;re\njust copying the XML-RPC examples but the point is that if you rethought\nit in terms of the web&#39;s native architecture (and use GET) you&#39;d get\nbetter caching, smaller messages, simpler messages and you&#39;d find that\nall of the specs you need are *already in place* so there is no need for\nanother spec.\n\nGET /states/41/name HTTP/1.1\n\nIt just works. There is no need for another spec.\n\n&gt; I am actually beginning to think that MIME-RPC and\n&gt; REST are orthogonal.  You can use MIME-RPC in\n&gt; REST-style or not.  \n\nYes, but when you use it in the REST-style I think it is just called\n&quot;MIME&quot;. The RPC part falls away. The type marshaling is not necessary if\nyou use externally defined custom XML vocabularies. The function naming\npart is not necessary because REST doesn&#39;t have function calls.\n\nThere&#39;s nothing wrong with RPC if it meets your needs. And MIME-RPC\nseems a good way to do RPC if you are trying to avoid defining an XML\nvocabulary. But I haven&#39;t yet seen how a REST web application would take\nadvantage of any of the MIME-RPC conventions.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
