REST also proposes to solve this problem.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Is the use of continuations to implement application flow RESTful?  Does \n&gt;&gt; it complement REST or detract from it?  Does it depend on how the \n&gt;&gt; continuations are represented?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Is it more RESTful:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     * To embed the entire continuation in the page, or just use a\n&gt;&gt;       continuation ID?\n&gt;&gt;     * To store the continuation on the client or the server?\n&gt;&gt;     * To put the continuation ID in the URL path, or in the query\n&gt;&gt;     part?\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve been meaning to write something about continuations for ages.\n&gt;\n&gt; Not only do I believe they are not RESTfull (because the resources\n&gt; don&#39;t really represent anything) but I also believe they&#39;re a bad\n&gt; idea.\n&gt;   \nIt doesn&#39;t seem to me that continuations are inherently unRESTful.  For \nexample, one could consider any web link to be a continuation.  The \nmeaning of the continuation on the server is the return of the resource \nto which it refers.\n\nBut, yes, continuations which are effectively opaque session state are \nunRESTful.\n&gt; Unless the continuation&#39;s state can be parcelled up with the\n&gt; continuation (and they&#39;re aren&#39;t many languages that support that -\n&gt; even LISPs can&#39;t the C bits of the stack) then you&#39;re going to need to\n&gt; scale with increasing hardware rather than multiple machines.\n&gt;   \nI think I agree with you here.  As long as by &quot;continuation&#39;s state&quot; you \nmean the continuation, and by &quot;continuation&quot; you mean the &quot;continuation \nID&quot; of which I spoke.  In other words, the continuation, as a \nrepresentation of &quot;what to do next&quot;, must be part of the request, if the \nsystem is to be scalable.  The &quot;what to next&quot; might be, take the result \nof this form, use it to change a resource, then return the page that \nrepresents that resource.\n&gt; In other words the problem is how do you load balance continuations?\n&gt; They&#39;re state so it&#39;s hard to do. Massive virtualization tools might\n&gt; help but people aren&#39;t focused on building those for languages that\n&gt; support continuations.\n&gt;   \nHmm, not familiar with massive virtualization tools.  Can you give an \nexample?\n\n-- \nLyle Kopnicky\nSoftware Project Engineer\nVeicon Technology, Inc.\n\n\n"}}
