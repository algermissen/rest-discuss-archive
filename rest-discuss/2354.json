IMO, the Developer&#39;s Key has an explicit impact \n&gt;&gt; on how the idea of a &quot;safe method&quot; should be interpreted.\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t see it as any different than the authorization info as part of\n&gt; an HTTP authentication transaction - it authenticates the user.  I\n&gt; don&#39;t see how it changes anything.\n\nThis is exactly the way I see it also, which is why I drew the \nanalogy to the session timeout issue.  It seems to me that if \nyou are calling this putative Google query unsafe, then you&#39;d \nhave to call anything that resets a session time-out clock  \nunsafe too.  Do you?\n\nFrom my perspective, while the user &quot;did not request the side-effects&quot; \nexplicitly, in this context, the action isn&#39;t of &quot;unexpected significance&quot; \neither.\n\n&gt;&gt; Interpreting safety this strictly, in this context, would seem to \n&gt;&gt; render an entire class of Web Services essentially un-GETable.  \n&gt;&gt; It would seem to reinforce the perception that REST is only good \n&gt;&gt; for mostly public data.\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t see it that way.  Would you argue that a GET that bumped up a\n&gt; counter was safe?\n\nWhat I meant was, in the future, there may be subscription-based \nWeb Services that employ counters in this way - perhaps it doesn&#39;t \nlock out the resource completely when the user goes past a their limit, \nbut it does have some side-effect.  \n\nIf conforming to a strict RESTian approach means that I can&#39;t use XSLT\nto, say, extract a url out of a Google query:\n\n  &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;url&quot; select=&quot;document($google-search)//url&quot;/&gt;\n\nthen something ain&#39;t right.  You seem to be saying the entire \nbusiness model itself ill-conceived, but I&#39;m not so sure.\n\n&gt; .... what I didn&#39;t say, but would still try to do, is to\n&gt; identify the results of each query by a URI, so that I could re-GET\n&gt; them over and over without those being counted as a hit against my 1000\n&gt; (unless Google doesn&#39;t want to let you - a distinct possibility, sigh).\n\nThis is sort of a side-bar issue, but it would probably cost more for \nGoogle to keep that resource around than it would to simply re-execute \nthe query. I doubt they&#39;d go for it.\n\nCouldn&#39;t they simply make the results cacheable for 24 hours on an\ninitial GET and be done with it?\n\n&gt; Anyhow, this is a bizarre case, because Google&#39;s business model on this\n&gt; service is completely screwed.  They&#39;d be much better off opening up\n&gt; http://www.google.com/xml and saying &quot;not for commercial use without\n&gt; agreement&quot;.  So as an example to set precedence, you can pretty much\n&gt; completely ignore Google.  Not that others won&#39;t try and copy them, but\n&gt; they won&#39;t last either.\n\nI don&#39;t see this as particularly bizarre. Even today there are services that \nlimit bandwidth etc.  This just seems like a more explicit metering - but \nthen again, I&#39;m not a business modeler. :)\n\n\n"}}
