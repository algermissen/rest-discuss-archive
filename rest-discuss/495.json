CREATE\n&gt; &gt; and DELETE can be determined by subscribing to a CHANGE of the\n&gt; &gt; container of the resource in question.\n&gt; \n&gt; Would you not say that the deletion of an object is a change of the\n&gt; object?\n\nThis is one of those &quot;axiom of choice&quot; things.  You can see the world\nthat way, or you can use the container view.  Personally, we&#39;ve gone\nwith the container view (for the most part).  We don&#39;t have enough\nexperience with it yet to know if that&#39;s the right thing or not, but\nI have confidence in it.  So no, we don&#39;t count the deletion of a\nresource as a change of state of that resource.  But when the client\ngoes to catch up on state, it will find out.  Until then, it will just\nnotice that the state hasn&#39;t updated in a while (like a stale cache).\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
