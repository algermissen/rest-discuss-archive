Although if it&#39;s allowed to define a resource as &quot;the set of \n&gt; buckets owned by the current user&quot; I don&#39;t see why you couldn&#39;t define a \n&gt; resource as &quot;a view of buckets owned by jpanzer filtered for the current \n&gt; user&quot;.  So if you allow the former I think you could legitimately say \n&gt; that the semantics of Allow could be honored if the resource is defined \n&gt; appropriately.  However I think you&#39;re disallowing the former.\n\nChanging Allow smells very bad to me.\n\nEntity metadata can change from response to response based on various \nfactors that allow the server to decide what response it will make. A \nclient (including an intermeditary) can make certain assumptions and not \nmake certain assumptions based on that.\n\nResource metadata can change only when the state of the resource \nchanges. A client (including an intermeditary) can make different \nassumptions based on that.\n\nIf a resource allows PUT then the resource allows PUT.\n\n&gt; In practice, it turns out to be very useful to know what&#39;s allowed and \n&gt; what&#39;s not without doing extra requests (some of which have side \n&gt; effects).  If for no other reason than avoiding extra network hops.  So \n&gt; having to request an additional entity to get 4 bits of information is \n&gt; in practical terms a very hard sell.  I suspect that people will instead \n&gt; go with an X- custom header.\n\nWhy request an additional entity? Why not have the relevant information \nin the entity that informs the client about the URI of the resource?\n\n\n"}}
