But there might be cases\nwhere you have to m=\r\nodel non-CRUD operations in your REST system - and\nnot all reasons are tech=\r\nnical. You customers are used to a certain\nvocabulary which contains well-k=\r\nnown and well-accepted verbs and you\nsimply can&#39;t change them to fit the &quot;r=\r\nesource&quot; paradigm.\n\nSo given this constraint that you absolutely must have =\r\nnon-standard\nverbs, what&#39;s the best way to model them?\n\nI have a blog entry=\r\n on this and would appreciate your suggestions.\n\nhttp://abstractfinal.blogs=\r\npot.com/2007/04/restful-urls-for-non-crud-operations.html\n\nThanks,\nKeyur\n\n\n"}}
