Every piece of meaning that is implicit\nabout a URI (if it were not opaque) is information that can not be\neasily used for automation by a machine.\n\nPractically though, as long as there is a fixed amount of non-opaque\ninformation that never ever grows, you&#39;re ok because understanding it\ncan be hardcoded in.  But if you want to add stuff over time, then each\ntime you do all the existing agents out there trying to automate stuff,\nwill need upgrading.\n\nBest to keep the URI opaque, and build the meaning up on the Semantic\nWeb.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
