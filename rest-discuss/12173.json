Dead thing=\r\ns.=A0 REST is not\n&gt;&gt; going to appeal to those people. All of its constraint=\r\ns are designed to keep\n&gt;&gt; systems living longer than we are willing or able=\r\n to anticipate.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Perhaps I&#39;m simply not familiar with the fitting tech=\r\nniques and technologies\n&gt;&gt; to create more life-like systems.=A0 Do you know=\r\n of any APIs that implements a\n&gt;&gt; few features and are used in system-to-sy=\r\nstem that fully embrace the REST\n&gt;&gt; hypertext constraints?=A0 Any insight w=\r\nould be greatly appreciated.\n&gt;\n&gt; Subbu Allamaraju recently published an art=\r\nicle at InfoQ about\n&gt; describing REST based applications that obey this con=\r\nstraint:\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0 =A0http://www.infoq.com/articles/subbu-allamaraju-rest\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n which points out that, if you want to go whole hog in this direction,\n&gt; yo=\r\nu stop describing the URI structure of your application (like we see\n&gt; in m=\r\nost REST API descriptions), and start talking about the &quot;rel&quot;\n&gt; (relationsh=\r\nip) values that can be used to identify semantically\n&gt; interesting hyperlin=\r\nks that the client might want to follow. =A0His\n&gt; examples use a &lt;link&gt; ele=\r\nment modeled after the way that Atom and HTML\n&gt; define it, which seems to b=\r\ne a popular trend for REST APIs that use\n&gt; XML.\n&gt;\n&gt; After a day of working =\r\nwith a colleague designing some new REST based\n&gt; APIs, I was musing about t=\r\nhis while watching one of the video blogs I\n&gt; enjoy (Hak5 from revision3.co=\r\nm), where they have occasional stories\n&gt; about remotely controlled tanks th=\r\nat can fire nerf missiles on\n&gt; command. =A0How to model the control of such=\r\n a thing with a REST API?\n&gt;\n&gt; The basic CRUD type operations map pretty cle=\r\nanly. =A0Presumably, the\n&gt; well-known URI of the service will offer me a li=\r\nnk I can use for\n&gt; creating a new tank in the first place. =A0And, the repr=\r\nesentation I get\n&gt; back can include a =A0&quot;self&quot; link so I can reference it =\r\nwith a GET\n&gt; (retrieve an updated representation), a PUT (update properties=\r\n), or a\n&gt; DELETE (remove this tank from my collection). =A0But how does one=\r\n model\n&gt; actually firing the missile? =A0One idea that seems plausible is t=\r\no\n&gt; include a link element with a &quot;fire&quot; relationship, and document (in\n&gt; y=\r\nour API spec) that a POST to this URI will cause the missile to be\n&gt; launch=\r\ned.\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0 =A0&lt;tank&gt;\n&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0&lt;name&gt;My First Tank&lt;/name&gt;\n&gt; =A0 =A0=\r\n =A0 =A0&lt;missile-state&gt;LOADED&lt;/missile-state&gt;\n&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0&lt;link rel=3D=\r\n&quot;self&quot; href=3D&quot;http://tanks-r-us.example.com/tanks/0123&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =\r\n=A0&lt;!-- POST to this link to prime the spring or whatever\n&gt; actually launch=\r\nes the missile --&gt;\n&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0&lt;link rel=3D&quot;ready&quot; href=3D&quot;http://tank=\r\ns-r-us.example.com/...&quot;\n&gt; title=3D&quot;Ready Launcher&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0&lt;!-- =\r\nPOST to this link to aim the launcher at the specified\n&gt; horizontal and ver=\r\ntical coordinates --&gt;\n&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0&lt;link rel=3D&quot;aim&quot; href=3D&quot;http://tan=\r\nks-r-us.example/com/...&quot;\n&gt; title=3D&quot;Aim Tank&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0&lt;!-- POST =\r\nto this link to fire the missle --&gt;\n&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0&lt;link rel=3D&quot;fire&quot; hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;http://tanks-r-us.example.com/...&quot;\n&gt; title=3D&quot;Fire Missile&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; =A0 =\r\n=A0 =A0 =A0...\n&gt; =A0 =A0&lt;/tank&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Presumably, the &quot;fire&quot; link would only =\r\nbe presented by the server when\n&gt; the tank was in a state where this operat=\r\nion makes sense (i.e. a\n&gt; &quot;fire&quot; link is included only when the missile is =\r\ncurrently LOADED).\n&gt; But the server should be prepared to handle the case w=\r\nhere a client\n&gt; tried to fire the missile after someone else had already fi=\r\nred it,\n&gt; because they had retrieved their representation earlier.\n&gt;\n&gt; A PO=\r\nST makes the most sense, because firing the missile is definitely\n&gt; not ide=\r\nmpotent :-). =A0Among other things, it will have side effects\n&gt; that change=\r\n the missile-state of my tank (probably first to FIRING,\n&gt; then to EMPTY) w=\r\nhich I can monitor by doing polled GETs, or being\n&gt; notified by some out-of=\r\n-band event mechanism. =A0And the usual semantics\n&gt; for error responses see=\r\nm to fit pretty well, too:\n&gt; * 202 -- if it takes a non-trivial amount of t=\r\nime to fire the missile,\n&gt; the server might accept the request\n&gt; =A0and ret=\r\nurn a URI to monitor for completion\n&gt; * 401 -- who the heck are you\n&gt; * 403=\r\n -- sorry , you&#39;re not allowed to fire my missile\n&gt; * 409 -- nobody can fir=\r\ne a missile when the launcher is empty (presumably\n&gt; =A0someone else beat y=\r\nou to the punch, so your reference to this URI is stale)\n&gt;\n&gt; In the particu=\r\nlar use case of firing, there isn&#39;t much need for a\n&gt; request entity (altho=\r\nugh, if a tank had more than one missile\n&gt; launcher, you might model things=\r\n by including a field in the request\n&gt; entity to select which launcher to f=\r\nire). =A0But, in principle, you\n&gt; could include an encapsulation of whateve=\r\nr information is needed for\n&gt; the server to do what you want it to do.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nEarlier threads have discussed firing off (possibly transactional)\n&gt; busine=\r\nss logic. =A0The same sort of approach would work there.\n&gt;\n&gt; Craig McClanah=\r\nan\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Solomon Duskis\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --------------------------=\r\n----------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
