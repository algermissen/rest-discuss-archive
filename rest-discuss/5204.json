I am having similar problems  \nright now, especially with making principled (as opposed to  \narbitrary) decisions when there are several choices to implement a  \ncertain functionality.\n\nWhat I would like to work an (and hopefully will) is a methodology  \nfor developing RESTful networked systems, including design principles  \n(beyond RESTs architectural constraints). Ideally this would also  \ninclude the issue of domain driven design, where the domain model  \nshould not only be used to derive MIME type or RDF namespace  \nsemantics but also the actual deployment of components [obviously not  \ncooked yet, but that&#39;s where I would like to go].\n\n\n&gt; For example, there was no programmer-level documentation on the\n&gt; &#39;hypermedia as engine of application state&#39; constraint until Joe\n&gt; Gregorio&#39;s &quot;Contructing or Traversing URIs?&quot;[1] column on xml.com.   \n&gt; That\n&gt; was a great start, but it&#39;s only a start.\n\nI think (one of) the major design principle is the goal to minimize  \nthe impact that domain model changes have on the components (it is an  \nadvantage if you can deploy them once an then more or less &#39;forget  \nabout them&#39; since you know that\n\n   - they are immune to backward compatible changes to the\n     message semantics since they will ignore whatever they do\n     not understand (partial understanding)\n\n   - they do not make (heavy) use of hardwired URIs but instead\n     discover them from the hypertext they process\n\n   - can be functionally extended by sending them code (assuming\n     you had built in things similar to JavaScript engines[1] into your\n     clients before you deployed them; that way using the browser\n     style for non-human controlled client components)\n\n[1] One thing I have been thinking about is an engine that would  \nprovide to the client the capability to transform RDF graphs it  \nreceives from newer namespace versions to the one it understands,  \ngiven the server would send the code to do the transformation.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I hope these comments won&#39;t be interpreted as a bitter rant.  These  \n&gt; are\n&gt; just my notes from the field.\n&gt;\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; - Lucas\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2005/04/06/restful.html.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
