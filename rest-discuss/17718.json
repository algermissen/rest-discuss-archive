BTW, Erik I loved your=\r\n post, sorry to take so long to say so. Your arguments about the supposed c=\r\nache inefficiency of mark based pagination really made me happy. Everybody =\r\nreads full pages on the same natural boundaries all the way up until they a=\r\nre where the action is, and then they are all pounding the same handful of =\r\npages as everybody else. It probably helps performance for them to all poll=\r\n more frequently while varnish yawns at them. Love it.\n\nI get some develope=\r\nrs who complain that they want diffs so they can see exactly which fields c=\r\nhanged. Why they think it&#39;s the servers job to do that with shared resource=\r\ns is something I&#39;ve never figured out. Anyway, I realized each atom entry c=\r\nan, with one efficient query, look up the previous change to the same entit=\r\ny and render a link to it with rel=3D&quot;predecessor-version&quot;. From any entry,=\r\n you can scroll back through the previous versions of the underlying entity=\r\n. \n\n\n"}}
