But with any architect=\r\nural style, you may need to combine.\n\n\nYes. I often tell people &quot;Just becau=\r\nse your RESTful APIs aren&#39;t really\nRESTful doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t like workin=\r\ng with them. It&#39;s still WAAAAY\nbetter than SOAP or something random.&quot;\n\n\n&gt; I=\r\nt may be a good discussion of whether REST badge may be removed if there is=\r\n just one non-complaint component in &gt; the system. When I think of SOA, I&#39;m=\r\n perfectly aware that not all components are going to be services, that won=\r\n&#39;t make &gt; it less SOA for that. We can make the same analysis with REST. Do=\r\nn&#39;t you think?\n\n\nI _do_ think that if you don&#39;t have all of the constraints=\r\n, you are no\nlonger RESTful. You might have a great system. It might solve =\r\nyour\nproblems well. But it&#39;s not RESTful. I&#39;d argue that the status of\n&#39;cod=\r\ne-on-demand&#39; implies that all of the other constraints are\nrequired. Fieldi=\r\nng also describes them in a way that implies to me\nthat they&#39;re all require=\r\nd.\n\n&gt;=A0REST consists of a set of architectural constraints chosen for the =\r\nproperties they induce on candidate architectures.\n\n"}}
