REST-based\ncomponents will see the anchor reference (which gives meaning),\nextract the reference, obtain the URI from that reference, and\nperform a retrieval action (implied by the anchor tag, not by the\nURI).  What exactly the URI identifies is not relevant to the client,\nsince it only follows the rules of interaction called for by the\nprotocols.\n\nThe origin server, if a request gets that far, receives a request and\nmaps it to a response, using however complicated or slow a process it\nmight desire.  To be Turing-like, you might even place a person on\nthe back end that does a manual mapping for each request.  However,\nfor efficiency reasons, the mappings are typically arranged in advance.\n\nREST does not define how the mapping works, and thus cannot say one\nway or the other as to the URI coiner&#39;s intention.  It does know that\nwhether the URI identifies the person or not is irrelevant to the\nmeaning and nature of a successful response to the request, which\nin all cases is a representation.  A &quot;Web page&quot; is actually a\nconstruct of one or more representations as rendered by the client,\nand thus is never directly identified by a URI (the first URI is\nmerely a starting point from which my home page is constructed as\na sequence of interactions, depending on the client configuration).\n\nWe have no way of knowing whether the URI, as used by the author,\nis intended to identify the person, their home page, or some other\naspect of past responses that the author simply had no other URI\nto reference.  That&#39;s why it is useful to look at the text inside\nthe anchor, both here and in other authors&#39; use of the URI, and\nany other metadata that might be laying about.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
