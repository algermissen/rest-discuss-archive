The method will return\nXML data that will link to more data (individual\nCredit Applications) \n\nIs this correct ? Are a CreditApplication and a\nCreditApplicationCollection different resources ?\n(different business objects ??)\n\nWould greatly appreciate it if somebody could very\nbriefly explain the flow / sequence for an actual J2EE\nimplementation using J2EE pattern terminology (Front\nController, Web Service Broker, Business Delegate,\nSession Facade, Business Object ???. \nWhich J2EE patterns are applicable for a REST\nimplementation ?\n\nThanks in Advance !\n\nMakarand\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
