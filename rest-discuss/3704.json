Thus a map is, potentially, a composite of other maps. \nFurthermore there may be many levels of nesting.  My question is, how \ncan traversal up an down this hierarchy be carried out in a REST-ful \nmanner? To illustrate:\n\nhttp://bioinformatics/Map - returns details list of all maps\n\n&lt;Maps&gt;\n\t&lt;Map href=&quot;http://bioinformatics/Map/1&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&lt;label&gt;Chromosome 1&lt;/label&gt;\n\t\t&lt;locations \nhref=&quot;http://bioinformatics/Map/1/Location&quot;/&gt;\n\t&lt;/Map&gt;\n\t... thousands of Map nodes ...\n\t&lt;Map href=&quot;http://bioinformatics/Map/123&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&lt;label&gt;Chromosome Z&lt;/label&gt;\n\t\t&lt;locations \nhref=&quot;http://bioinformatics/Map/1/Location&quot;/&gt;\n\t&lt;/Map&gt;\n&lt;/Maps&gt;\n\t\t \n\nhttp://bioinformatics/Map/123 - returns a specific map\n&lt;Map href=&quot;http://bioinformatics/Map/123&quot;&gt;\n\t&lt;label&gt;Clone Z&lt;/label&gt;\n\t&lt;locations href=&quot;http://bioinformatics/Map/123/Location&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/Map&gt;\n\nLet&#39;s suppose that http://bioinformatics/Map/1 contains other maps \n(e.g. http://bioinformatics/Map/123). At present the way to retrieve \na list of the Maps contained by http://bioinformatics/Map/1 is to \nissue a GET to http://bioinformatics/Map/1/Location. This returns a \nlist of positional Locations on the map (i.e coordinates). Embedded \nwithin these locations are links to the parent map and the mappable \n(i.e. the Map located at this position):\n\n&lt;Locations&gt;\n\t&lt;Location href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;\n\t\t.... \n\t&lt;Location&gt;\n\t.... thousands of Location nodes ...\n\t&lt;Location href=&quot;http://bioinformatics/Map/1/Location/10&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&lt;position&gt;0.2&lt;/position&gt;\n\t\t&lt;map href=&quot;http://bioinformatics/Map/1&quot;/&gt;\n\t\t&lt;mappable href=&quot;http://bioinformatics/Map/123&quot;/&gt;\n\t&lt;/Location&gt;\n&lt;/Locations&gt;\n\nUsing the links provided in a Location node it should be possible to \ntraverse the graph of Maps.\n\nTo my mind this is consistent with the REST-ful idea of gradually \nrevealing data. Applications wishing to use the data should certainly \nbe relatively simple to write and the consistency of the interface \nappeals to me. However, this scheme has the disadvantage of, \npotentially, requiring many GET requests to traverse the graph. This \nis mainly because the &#39;hierarchy&#39; is not a simple tree or forest - a \nmap be contained by more than one map. While mutliple GET&#39;s shouldn&#39;t \nbe an issue for any client keeping a connection to the server open, \nI&#39;d like to avoid any such requirement. Thus, I&#39;d like to extend the \ninterface such that it is possible to traverse the graph of Maps, \nbypassing the intermediate step of accessing Locations (the Location \ndata may not be of much interest to a client in any case). Is there \nany sensible way to represent such a traversal? So far I&#39;ve thought \nof defining two new resources, Maps ( = Containers) and Mappables ( = \nContents), to make such traversal possible. By specifying in the URI \nthe resource to which movement should be relative, traversal up or \ndown the hierarchy should be possible. For example:\n\n\nhttp://bionformatics/Maps/Map/123  - would return a list of Maps that \ncontain http://bioinformatics/Map/123.\n\nand\n\nhttp://bioinformatics/Mappables/Map/1 - would return a list of all \nthe Maps contained by http://bioinformatics/Map/1\n\n\nDoes this scheme make sense? Although it seems distinctly un-REST \nlike, it does allow me to do what I want to do. Mmmm... should I even \nwant to do what I want to do?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\nRichard\n\n\n\n\n"}}
