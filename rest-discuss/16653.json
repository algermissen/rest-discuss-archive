If I want to find out what\n&gt; they mean right now I have no choice but to go to [insert preferred search\n&gt; engine]. I suspect that this is in no small part due to the high barrier to\n&gt; registration in place right now. Whilst this might well make sense for\n&gt; &quot;fundamental&quot; types like application/xml or application/atom+xml, it makes\n&gt; far less sense for domain-specific dialects of the fundamental types.\n\nHi Alan,\n\nI understand where you are coming from, and certainly agree that \nsearching for custom dialects is far from ideal.\n\nPersonally I feel that custom dialects often point to something being \nwrong, either caused by misunderstanding or because the core media type \n  the custom type is a dialect of has a feature missing, such as \nsupporting schemas and extensibility natively and unambiguously within \nthe media type. Further, I&#39;d suggest that in most, if not all cases a \nbetter course of action would be to address the issue within the core \nmedia type, perhaps along with others who also feel the need for custom \ndialects, in order to resolve a standardized approach rather that \nbenefits all, rather than simply defining a case specific dialect as a \nnew media type.\n\nSimilarly, I feel that before creating a new media type or dialect it&#39;s \nbest to re-use wherever possible, if you get an &#39;almost right&#39; fit then \nwork with them to improve the media type for all, failing that and where \na need for a new media type has been proven to be needed, then working \nwith the community and discussing the proposed media type with experts \non the ietf-types list in order to create something that can be \nregistered will probably lead to better results. There are many people \nwho are happy to help create solutions for problems, and standardization \nbodies + would-be communities that will gladly assist in creating a \nstandardized solution.\n\n From where I&#39;m standing there are three clear paths to creating \ndiscoverable custom dialects:\n1 - make provision for dialects/extensibility/schemas in the core media type\n2 - petition IANA/IETF to allow a third level of media type identifier \nwhere by the third argument is under the control of a body/registry \nspecified in the core media type specification. For instance \napplication/json/contact, where application/json is under the domain of \nIANA and /contact is in the domain of a media type specific registry - \nit may even be worth pleading the case for a data/ main type.. \ndata/json|xml/dialect\n3- attempt to register a vnd. specific custom media type\n\nListed in order of preference, if it turns out that (1) is not possible \nfor xml/json/(similar?) then it may be worth suggesting something \nsimilar to (2) to solve the problem at internet scale. I still can&#39;t \nreally see a case for (3) - imo it&#39;s better to create a v2 of a \nmedia-type which caters for dialects/schemas/extensibility than it is to \nregister an internet media type identifier for a single-case solution.\n\nBest,\n\nNathan\n\n"}}
