I certainly didn&#39;t say that.  I said when designing a \nsite the server manager should be able to define all resources with URIs \neven if there is no plan to make those URIs accessible.  How does one go \nabout designing a REST application using &quot;mystery resources&quot; which have no \nURIs?\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;If you can&#39;t assign each of your variants a URI, how do you know your \n&gt;negotiated resource isn&#39;t an endpoint?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;That&#39;s up to the server to decide, right? I don&#39;t think it makes sense \n&gt;to force URI assignment if a resource won&#39;t be accessible under it \n&gt;(actually, I would think that&#39;s a bad idea).\n&gt;\n\nI&#39;m speaking of the conceptualization of a website, not the realization of a \nwebsite.  The server decides nothing, it only does what the server manager \ntells it to do, nobody is suggesting the &quot;forcing of URI assignments&quot;. I have \na variety of URIs which are not available to the public, however, they have \nURIs so my system can address those resources internally.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Of course that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a good idea to expose as much of your \n&gt;system&#39;s internals as possible as separate resources. However, REST \n&gt;doesn&#39;t seem to require that (or if it does, please point me to the text \n&gt;section).\n&gt;\n\nA resource is a set, &quot;the values in a set may be resource representations or \nresource identifiers&quot;.  How can you have a resource under this definition if \nyou have no resource identifier?  Is it possible to access, or even generate, \na representation of some resource which has no identifier?\n\n&gt;\n&gt;As I don&#39;t know what is meant by &quot;endpoint&quot;, it&#39;s hard to argue with.\n&gt;\n&gt;Roy says:\n&gt;\n&gt;The only thing that is required to be \n&gt;static for a resource is the semantics of the mapping, since the \n&gt;semantics is what distinguishes one resource from another.&quot;\n&gt;\n\nYou keep asking me this and I keep giving the same response.  _I_ define an \nendpoint to be some resource whose mapping semantics are variable.  Is this \nso wrong?  Should I stop?  Any suggestions of what else to call such a \nresource?\n\n-Eric\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Best regards, Julian\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
