Anyhow - it helps to being able to send people a pointer to &#39;here is what your API is&#39;.\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; REST sounds cool...that&#39;s why they like it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; On your second point, I am not sure. That makes the argument that RPC over HTTP is absolutely bad.\n\nYes, it is. Far worse than using traditional RPC mechanisms that use an IDL to define the interface. When using HTTP you allways are at risk of not documenting the contract at all. In addition, RPC over HTTP make it easy to (wrongly) assume that the benefits of HTTP (e.g. caching) are at your fingertips. They are all lost when treating HTTP as transport.\n\n\n&gt; Even though I can see the value that a RESTful style provides, I don&#39;t see why a person building an AJAX style application who uses RPC over HTTP as a means to improve responsiveness is in itself a bad thing.\n\nSee http://nordsc.com/ext/classification_of_http_based_apis.html#uri-rpc-effect\n\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; I personally worked on quite a few RPC over HTTP style AJAX apps where the goal was improving responsiveness in the application and to offer a rich client type experience in a brower. Yes it dishonors hypermedia constraints (we didn&#39;t even know what those were), but it worked and made paying customers pretty happy that they had a more interactive / responsive UI. That was the primary goal and the benefit. I don&#39;t think we were deluded into any other benefits.\n\n\nHmm, I am not sure you did something unRESTful there. It sounds like you built an AJAX Web interface, yes? If your user agent is a browser and you use HTML and JSON, there is not really anything you violate (except for stuff like authentication, frames and other violations you commonly see on the human web).\n\nDid you have a non-browser user agent at all?\n\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; Do you see that as &quot;wrong&quot;?\n\nNot necessarily. It would be wrong if you used a user agent that had hard-coded knowledge of out-of-band information (such as the meaning of some action=order parameter in the URI).\n\nNote though, that the issue with regard to REST&#39;s benefits are not how well one application works, but how well the overall architecture controls conplexity,\nenables evolution and allows for scalability (e.g. can you put a Web cache in your application to improve performance without knowing the semantics of the application?)\n\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; Personally I feel like calling that REST is wrong,\n\nNot sure  - see above.\n\n\nTo strengthen my point again: Yes, some/many people abuse HTTP and frameworks should somewhat support those (ab)uses. But it is IMHO a huge mistake to even cause the impression such (ab)uses are any good at all. I&#39;d rather say: if you want to do RPC, use a proper technology (RMI, Corba, WS-*) and do it right.\n\nREST done wrong is IMHO worse than RPC done right (due to the out-of-band (often undocumented) information and the performance penalty you pay for HTTP-style interactions).\n\nJan\n\nP.S. Using a ranting style to foster discussion (no offense intended).\n\n\n\n\n&gt; in the way calling some that is not an implementation of MVC, MVC.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Glenn\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; On Sun, Jun 6, 2010 at 9:04 PM, Jan Algermissen &lt;algermissen1971@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Glenn,\n&gt; \n&gt; On Jun 7, 2010, at 12:10 AM, Glenn Block wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Darrel and I were chatting and we started to discuss the problem of using &quot;RPC over HTTP&#39; to mean &quot;REST&quot;. The result of that conversation seemed to be that the problem is the usage of the term &#39;REST&#39; in that nothing about RPC over HTTP is RESTful in nature.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think one of the big problems in this area is the lack of proper names for all the various abuses of REST. Having names helps to differentiate. I created a classification of mis-uses a while back: http://nordsc.com/ext/classification_of_http_based_apis.html\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; My argument, the fact that folks want to use HTTP as a pure transport for loose XML/JSON in itself is not a problem asd long as one has proper expectations about the pros/cons.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, but the problem being the end of the sentence: &quot;as long as one has proper expectations&quot;. I seriously doubt that a significant number of people understand the trade offs (if they did, they would just do true REST because the gains outweigh (IMHO small) the additional effort).\n&gt; \n&gt; While there might not be a problem if you understand what you are doing, it also makes no real sense to do it (it is not really justifiable).\n&gt; \n&gt; Jan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That led me to think of a new term to represent the &quot;RPC over HTTP&quot; movement and which is along the spirit of the whole &quot;No SQL&quot; mantra.  &quot;No SOAP&quot; - the meaning of which is &quot;Not Only SOAP&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; LIke it or hate it?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards\n&gt; &gt; Glenn\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -----------------------------------\n&gt;  Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n&gt;  NORD Software Consulting\n&gt; \n&gt;  Mail: algermissen@...\n&gt;  Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n&gt;  Work: http://www.nordsc.com/\n&gt; -----------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n-----------------------------------\n Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n NORD Software Consulting\n\n Mail: algermissen@...\n Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n Work: http://www.nordsc.com/\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
