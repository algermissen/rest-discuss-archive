Moreover, I also think you generally have different design\ngoals with client and server APIs.  For example performance is\nnormally a lot more important for servers than clients.  Also, a\nsimple API might be more desirable on the client than on the server\n(again, because of performance).  For these reasons it will likely do\nmore harm than good to try to use server abstractions in a client API\nor vice-versa.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
