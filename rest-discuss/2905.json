In\nthis case, it&#39;s a constraint purely on the data elements so is well\nisolated.\n\n&gt; i&#39;m trying to ground this theory in the real world.  what would it mean\n&gt; say if amazon have a resource for a book, or ebay has a resource for an\n&gt; auction?  just imagine for a second that you have these URIs rather than\n&gt; the actual ugly implementation-dependent (asp/cgi/jsp/cfm)\n&gt; querystring-ridden cookie-dependent non-idempotent ones.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.ebay.com/auctions/2h4iug29225/\n&gt; http://www.amazon.com/items/dh75s8d646/\n&gt; \n&gt; this implies that amazon/ebay actually have well-defined resources for\n&gt; these URIs to identify.  in the semantic web:\n&gt; \n&gt; - would the xml representations of these resources look different, or\n&gt; - would there be a completely seperate RDF representation, or\n&gt; - something else?\n\nPotentially all of those.  It&#39;s your choice.  I&#39;d opt for a combo of\n#1 and #2 if I can, i.e. if no XML schema is mandated.\n\n&gt; i am involved in similar work to joe gregorio at\n&gt; http://wellformedweb.org ; we&#39;re just using different tools, and i\n&gt; haven&#39;t published my work yet.  i am interested in how RDF can\n&gt; complement this type of work and make our RESTful systems\n&gt; Semantic_Web-ready.\n\nJust use RDF/XML instead of just XML.  I found this article wonderful,\nboth as a guide for how to introduce some RDF into your XML, but also\nas an intro to RDF (assuming you grok the very basics, i.e. triples);\n\nhttp://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/10/30/rdf-friendly.html\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.
