Bowman &lt;eric@...&gt; [2007-07-07 00:10]:\n&gt; Sorry, I think you&#39;re off in the weeds here.  If I want to\n&gt; express that a resource no longer exists on the server, I\n&gt; have a choice between responding with a 404 or a 410 response.\n&gt; I see no reason to move any files to a temporary URL,\n\nWhy do you keep thinking in terms of files? Files are irrelevant.\nWhat does moving a file to a URI even mean?\n\nYou’re exposing your knowledge of the previous existence of a\nresource as a separate resource.\n\nI admit that responding with a redirect is the wrong answer. It\ntook me a few iterations to get to a 200 response to a DELETE\nwith a link in the entity-body, but that is the right approach.\n\nThe server responds to the DELETE by saying “OK, it’s gone;\nhere’s a description of how you can also delete my memory of\nits previous existence by deleting the following resource.”\n\nThe resource and the server’s memory of its existence are two\nseparate Things, and should be exposed separately.\n\n&gt; which if the file is undeleted, needs to change to a redirect,\n&gt; increasing URL proliferation and application complexity for no\n&gt; reason I can discern from RFC 2616 or REST.\n\nYour double-DELETE is a very surprising interpretation of what\nRFC 2616 allows. You are effectively overloading the meaning of\n410 in a way that the uniformity constraint reserves for the\nentity body.\n\nYou seem to be following the WebDAV school of HTTP which\nconsiders resources somehow equivalent to files on the server’s\ndisk and prefers to model additional aspects of state by putting\nthem into the method instead of exposing them as resources.\n\nURI proliferation is about multiple names for the same resource.\nI don’t understand how this applies to my proposed protocol\ndesign. From a REST point of view, URI starvation (where you\ndon’t expose sufficient state as separate resources and overload\naspects of other messages instead) is worse.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
