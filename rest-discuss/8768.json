It&#39;s called Beatnik, is  \nwritten in SwingFX\nand is available here:\n\nhttps://sommer.dev.java.net/source/browse/sommer/trunk/misc/ \nAddressBook/www/\n\nIt&#39;s an early prototype.\n\nWith many services publishing foaf files (one of them had 15 million  \nin December) [1],\nthis is an application that can be immediately useful.\n\nSince the data is out there in RDF formats, which is very flexible,  \nmore flexible than DOM tools are good\nfor, one has to use some of the 500 rdf tools out there. [2]\n\nThe nice thing is it is very powerful. If one makes the right  \narchitectural decisions, one can get some very interesting\nfeatures [3].\n\nIf people would like to help out on that project, feel free to join.  \nThere is so much to do in this area, there is space for everyone, and  \nmore.\n\nHenry\n\n\n[1] http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/15_million_foaf_files\n[2] They were 250 when I posted this\n     http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/250_semantic_web_tools\n     now there are 500\n[3] http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/beatnik_change_your_mind\n\nOn 1 Jun 2007, at 09:23, Alan Dean wrote:\n\n&gt; On 6/1/07, John D.

Synchronization of appointments, reminders, contacts, etc\n&gt; would be a doddle. You could instruct an agent app to choose what\n&gt; synched to where and so on. Dismissal of a reminder on your office to\n&gt; start driving to a meeting could cause a reminder to be set from your\n&gt; mobile (cell on the other side of the pond) immediately prior to the\n&gt; meeting - and the two PIMs need not be the same and need not have\n&gt; knowledge of one another.\n&gt;\n&gt; ... gazes wistfully into the middle distance ...\n&gt;\n&gt; Alan\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
