(Web browsers know how to create a POST request from a user&#39;s submission of a form)\n\nThe user however does have an understanding (expectation) of what the server is intending to do with those files. This expectation is the basis for choosing to activate the hypermedia control in the first place.\n\nIs that point of view correct?\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
