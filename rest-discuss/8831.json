To: &#39;Mike Dierken&#39;\n&gt; Cc: &#39;REST Discuss&#39;\n&gt; Subject: RE: [rest-discuss] RESTful CRUD Module?\n&gt; \n&gt; Chuck Hinson wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But I think you missed my point, and the point was that the\n&gt; &gt; combined &quot;edit&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; & &quot;edit_form&quot; seem to be part of process flow that REST\n&gt; &gt; does not define.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; REST seems to define the retrieval of the data and the\n&gt; &gt; update of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; data, but not the interim process.\n&gt; &gt; The &#39;hypermedia as the engine of application state&#39; is the part of \n&gt; &gt; REST that describes this.\n&gt; &gt; The &#39;uniform interface&#39; aspect talks about GET/PUT/DELETE \n&gt; of a single \n&gt; &gt; resource, but it&#39;s the collection of resources that make up \n&gt; the full \n&gt; &gt; application and REST describes how that collection of resources is \n&gt; &gt; used.\n&gt; \n&gt; Again, the point is that when designing a REST system you \n&gt; don&#39;t need all the hacks that a non-javascript-enabled \n&gt; browser requires. The browser has almost zero knowledge of \n&gt; process or workflow, so the knowledge has to be embedded into \n&gt; representations or created as otherwise unneeded resources. \n&gt; \n&gt; In a custom REST app it can know that when the process wants \n&gt; to add an item it requests the hypermedia &quot;index&quot;, looks for \n&gt; the URL of the &quot;add&quot; resource, builds a known content type to \n&gt; add, then POSTs to the add URL.  For an edit, it requests the \n&gt; hypermedia &quot;index&quot;, looks for both the URL of resource and \n&gt; the &quot;update&quot; URL for the resource, modifies a known content \n&gt; type, then PUTs to the update URL. In the browser the content \n&gt; type is generic and thus there is a need for both add form \n&gt; and an edit form resources.  Accomodating those hacks to make \n&gt; the browser work with generic content types means creating \n&gt; &quot;nouns&quot; for the forms to accommodate them.  Or at least \n&gt; that&#39;s how it seems to me.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Again, this understanding doesn&#39;t invalidate REST at all, it \n&gt; just clarifies some of the difference between &quot;pure&quot; REST and \n&gt; REST for use in a browser.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; That said, can you explain how one would communicate to the\n&gt; &gt; same URL\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the server that one view should be public and another \n&gt; private?  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Seems to me it should be a different URL.\n&gt; &gt; They would be different URLs, I wasn&#39;t suggesting otherwise.\n&gt; \n&gt; That was part of point I was trying to make, for that context \n&gt; multiple URLs are required, not one.\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; -Mike Schinkel\n&gt; http://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\n&gt; http://www.welldesignedurls.org\n&gt; http://atlanta-web.org - http://t.oolicio.us\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
