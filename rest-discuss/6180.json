The REST service allows the creation of a service \n&gt; request through a simple POST to a URI. The implementation of \n&gt; this REST &quot;service&quot; connects to the JMS broker, sends the \n&gt; corresponding message, and waits (with timeout) until it \n&gt; receives confirmation that the message was received by the \n&gt; JMS service. This confirmation of reception implies that the \n&gt; service request has created  a resource and this new resource \n&gt; is returned to the REST client who can, at anytime, GET it to \n&gt; see the status of his orignal request (running, completed, \n&gt; cancelled, logging ...).\nI did something like that about five years ago :\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/destiny\nThat project is more of a (working) demo but the ideas are valid & can be\nvery useful.\n\n"}}
