I second him: we need more data on the\n&gt; problems in currently deployed caches to talk intelligently about\n&gt; things. Hopefully Mark Nottingham or others will share the details of\n&gt; their findings.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ll pick up on this comment though and riff a little. Here goes:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; My experience with developing (and supporting) the HTTP server\n&gt; &gt; and client stack in one of SAP&#39;s portal products for many years\n&gt; &gt; says that new methods do not cause major problems. That may be\n&gt; &gt; influenced by the fact that most *authoring* goes over HTTPS,\n&gt; &gt; and thus caches won&#39;t be able to do any harm.\n&gt;\n&gt; The subtlety of the word &quot;authoring&quot; is the key point here and this\n&gt; subtlety is often lost.\n\nI have to admit that I really don&#39;t understand the distinction being made here.\nWhat exactly does &quot;authoring&quot; mean and why is it treated differently than\neverything else.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; What I often find in practice is that many simply go beyond having\n&gt; &quot;authoring over HTTPS&quot; and simply say &quot;everything over HTTPS&quot;. I know\n&gt; I had to deal with braindead internal IT corporate standards at Big\n&gt; Blue that really set back that company&#39;s embrace of the web by years.\n&gt; &quot;Why is it so slow?&quot; was a common question about web usage at IBM 6\n&gt; years ago.\n&gt;\n&gt; When I hear people say without qualifying that &quot;SSL/TLS is the\n&gt; answer&quot;, what they are really saying is let&#39;s remove all visibility to\n&gt; intermediaries. The downside of this as an architectural solution is\n&gt; that you lose the possible benefits of caches and other intermediaries\n&gt; for things other than authoring. And common case performance is\n&gt; degraded.\n&gt;\n\nActually, SSL doesnt just remove visibility for intermediaries, it pretty\nmuch removes the possibility of even having intermediaries (at least the\ntransparent kinds).\n\nProblem is, when you start talking about security, intermediaries become\na liability - that&#39;s why SSL tunnels through proxies.  If I&#39;m going to the\ntrouble of encrypting my conversation, I probably don&#39;t trust any intermediary\nto see any of the data being exchanged (authoring or otherwise).\n\n--Chuck\n\n"}}
