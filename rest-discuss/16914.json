How about nonce and qop in this case. What are the pros and cons of this approach.\n&gt;\n&gt; Why I am asking this question is.. we are planning to host a RESTful WS for our partner and all the resources are protected and needs authentication. Please advise.\n\nYou should never send authentication details for ANY scheme until \nchallenged for them. There are sadly some software out there that will \npre-emptively authentication headers for the Basic scheme, (XHR from \njavascript in Safari used to have such a bug if you set the username and \npassword programatically, but I haven&#39;t checked in a while to see if \nthis is still the case), and the obvious security hole in doing so if \nthe scheme used on the server isn&#39;t Basic should suffice to explain why \nit&#39;s a bad idea generally.\n\nAlso, you should change the nonce used regularly (a matter of seconds, \nminutes or at the very outside hours, depending on how \nsecurity-sensitive the resources are) to avoid replay attacks, so 401s \nwill never be avoidable (if the reason the server is rejecting a request \nis that it has changed the nonce, it should include stale=true to \nindicate that previous details can be retried with the new nonce).\n\nFor this reason it is worth keeping the entity body of a 401 small, to \navoid excess transmission. In a webservice a very small (maybe just \nsingle-element) XML document can suffice. In an HTML case a small \ndocument merely stating that one needs to log in (linked to &quot;&quot; to \ntrigger a reload on link traversal perhaps). In some cases the simple \nXML document described above with an XSLT to produce a simple HTML case \nwhen viewed in a browser can hit both cases adequately.\t\n\n\n"}}
