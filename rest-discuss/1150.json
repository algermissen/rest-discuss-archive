There are &#39;lots of nouns, few verbs&#39; but you\nstill go through interfaces to make any changes - you just style things to\nreuse simple interfaces.\nREST is more about state transfer across large scale applications than an\nAPI approach that uses generic local object interfaces.\nThere are similarities between distributed state-exchaning applications and\n&#39;programming with interfaces&#39; - but they shouldn&#39;t be equated.\n\n\n\n"}}
