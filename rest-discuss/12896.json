There is URIs mentioned in the HTTP spec, and there is=\r\n the HTTP URI scheme. The HTTP URI scheme does not say anything about fragm=\r\nent identifiers.\n&gt;\n&gt; Likewise, you will note in the practical sense of &quot;wha=\r\nt to expect in real world implementations&quot;, that Search Engines do not inde=\r\nx content after the #. This imposes a real world practical limitation on re=\r\nal world use. However, Google killing the question mark is huge. This kind =\r\nof opens the door, just a crack, about the idea of Google having to require=\r\n its Sitemap technology be able to understand fragment identifiers. In hype=\r\nrmedia theory, this means we can finally start building Web applications wi=\r\nth &quot;open linking&quot; and &quot;deep linking&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; As a separate matter, I do not un=\r\nderstand how one can say my points are over reading this, when there is an =\r\nunproductive thread about renaming HATEOAS with another acronym, that has 5=\r\n6 replies and counting. Um, priorities, people?\n&gt;\n&gt; If anything, I think wh=\r\nat I am saying here is what I would hope Gartner&#39;s think tank would be focu=\r\nsing its energy on. Unfortunately, I have to face the realities that some p=\r\neople find a simple idea like REST so complicated that the best solution is=\r\n to confuse them with even more acronyms with empty meanings. Gartner&#39;s cli=\r\nents expect power points with those kinds of things. I get that.\n&gt;\n&gt; I gues=\r\ns I am just using REST to build real applications and not simply writing ab=\r\nout REST for the sake of writing about it.
