ETag provides information about the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; resource, not the current message, so it is orthogonal to cache\n&gt;&gt;&gt; control.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hmm. How else might an ETag be used other than determining if a  \n&gt;&gt; cached entity is still current?\n&gt;\n&gt; The ETag *header field* is a response header.  The entity-tag value\n&gt; contained within that header field may be used in *later* requests\n&gt; for cache-related conditionals, like If-None-Match and If-Match.\n&gt;\n&gt; The entity tag is actually metadata about the internal resource\n&gt; mapping on the server -- it does not necessarily reflect anything\n&gt; about the content (other than the premise that the value must\n&gt; change whenever the content is changed).  That is why it doesn&#39;t\n&gt; matter which status code is used or what content is supplied in\n&gt; the response message, since the Etag is referring to the mapping\n&gt; operation rather than the content of *this* message.  Hence, the\n&gt; ETag provided in a 201 response must be the entity-tag of the\n&gt; mapping result after completing the resource-changing operation.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is a tricky thing to understand, and the spec does a poor job\n&gt; of explaining it.\n&gt;\nI think you clarified it. I believe I understand your point about 201  \nafter PUT, but could you clarify what you mean by &quot;internal resource  \nmapping?&quot; Do you mean the way a server will map a URI to a  \nrepresentation? But if content negotiation is taking place, the  \nserver would need the request headers too to determine a  \nrepresentation, not just a URI. What does &quot;internal resource mapping&quot;  \nmean? What&#39;s being mapped to what?\n\nThanks.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nPresident\nArtima, Inc.\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n\n\n"}}
