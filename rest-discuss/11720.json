Unfortunately I&#39;m not sure this book is going to go into those\n&gt; topics in much detail. I&#39;m also not 100% sure I&#39;m happy with some of\n&gt; the advice but I&#39;m still only getting started with it, I believe Alan\n&gt; Dean is going to read it too so he&#39;ll have a far more informed opinion\n&gt; on it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Actually on the Microsoft side, I&#39;d say they could definitely do with\n&gt; a little help from experts particularly on the WCF REST Starter Kit:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/cc950529.aspx\n&gt;\n&gt; Seems like Microsoft and their MVP&#39;s are starting to talk about REST\n&gt; quite a lot, not entirely sure if you guys would be happy with some of\n&gt; it though.\n&gt;\n&gt; - Colin\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
