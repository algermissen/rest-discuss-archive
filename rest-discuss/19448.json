Sometimes, item #&#39;s are re-used.\n\nI don&#39;t get this concept of substituting a link to shave bytes, because\nI use compression and it doesn&#39;t amount to much even on Amazon&#39;s scale,\nespecially when considering those lost properties Roy mentions -- the\ncost of doing business in the modern world is bandwidth, cutting corners\nto shave bytes is sloppy business practice.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
