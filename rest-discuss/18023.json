Hence the topic of conversation.\n\n&gt;The fact that the guys that built Rails were implementing rest badly (and calling it restful routes or whatever)\n\nWith respect, that is complete nonsense. Rails&#39; routing DSL is\nactually extremely flexible, and significantly more sophisticated than\nmost alternatives. What exactly are you trying to do with HTTP that\nyou can&#39;t do with Rails?\n\n&gt; won&#39;t be enough of a leverage to change the whole web. neither was it for people that did non-safe operations on Get.\n\nThat is not a sensible comparison:\n\nUsing GET for non-safe operations is obviously wrong, as the benefit\nof GET being safe across the web is clear. On the other hand, the\nbenefit to having guaranteed fullness of a PUT request across the web\nis _not at all clear_.\n\n&gt; Eventually, people learn and use HTTP the way it&#39;s implemented out there and stop breaking things and everybody lives happily after that.\n\nSo what is the _actual concern_ you have about partial PUT that&#39;s\npreventing you from living happily ever after? What is it that&#39;s\nactually being broken?\n\n&gt; As for &quot;fixing&quot; it, indeed there is nothing to be fixed, there&#39;s already POST and PATCH, the stuff that needs fixing is rails.\n\nNeither of those fixes would actually work in practice - you can&#39;t\njust swap out partial PUT for POST or PATCH because neither of them\nare idempotent and therefore would require clients to remodel how they\ndeal with failed requests.\n\n"}}
