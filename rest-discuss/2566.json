A Portfolio\nresource (let&#39;s say it&#39;s at URI: &quot;/Portfolio&quot;) undergoes changes, but\ncan be retrieved via &quot;as of&quot; snapshots.  The client does not care\nexactly when the Portfolio changed; it only needs to know &quot;what was\nmy Portfolio as-of 2002-09-16 end-of-business?&quot;.  The server may\nchoose to impose the convention of appending a simple yyyymmdd\nencoding of the &#39;as-is&#39; parameter, thusly: &quot;/Portfolio/20020916&quot;.\nHow does it encode instructions for the client to do this in some\nstandard way, barring HTML as a specific solution?  Does Xforms\naddress this problem?\n\nWould there be any particular reason to prefer\n&quot;/Portfolio?asof=20020916&quot; or some other encoding over the one\nabove?\n\nWalden\n\n"}}
