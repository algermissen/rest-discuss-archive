URI&#39;s name\n&gt;&gt; Resources which have multiple representations, REST of course stands\n&gt;&gt; for Representation state transfer, and RDF is the simplest possible\n&gt;&gt; way to describe Resources. They are three parts of the triangle. Of\n&gt;&gt; course I don&#39;t have to convince anyone on this list of the power,\n&gt;&gt; simplicity and clarity of REST. I do urge RESTafarians though to\n&gt;&gt; start look at RDF more carefully (not necessarily the xml version) as\n&gt;&gt; the other side of the task they are endeavoring to accomplish.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Only the simplest possible thing on the web can work. URIs, REST and\n&gt;&gt; RDF are each perfections of simplicity that mesh together perfectly.\n&gt;\n\nExamples 1 and 2 need rules of some sort. This is being worked on at  \nthe W3C. The W3c works step by simple step, which is important if one  \nwants to get something this important our right.\n\n&gt; 1. How do I express a fact about all pages in my site?\n\nYou can see how it could be done with this simple SPARQL example\n\nCONSTRUCT { ?url :ownedBy &lt;http://bblfish.net/people/henry/card#me&gt; . }\nWHERE {\n    ?url a :InformationResource .\n    FILTER REGEX( str(?url), &quot;http://bblfish.net/.*&quot; )\n}\n\n\n&gt; 2. how do I express falsehood (None of my pages need cookies)?\n\n\nTruth and Falsehood is an interesting concept by the way. It is a  \nrelation on sentences, or sets of sentences.\nThis is well known from Tarski&#39;s work taken up later by Donald  \nDavidson. Facts are not true or false,\nsentences are.\n\n&quot;Snow is white&quot; is true in English if and only if Snow is white .\n\nis the well known example. This is why truth is known as a  \ndisquotational function. It removes the quotes from the asserted  \nsentence.  In practical terms, if I believe that something you say is  \ntrue, then I believe it. I accept the content of your sentence into  \nmy belief store.\n\nIn RDF this means that we have to assert truth or falsity on graphs  \nof sentences.\n\nCONSTRUCT { ?g a :Falsehood . }\nWHERE {\n    GRAPH ?g {\n       ?url a :NeedsCookie .\n    }\n    FILTER REGEX( str(?url), &quot;http://bblfish.net/.*&quot; )\n}\n\n\n&gt; 3. how do I resolve things efficiently in the absence of the\n&gt; assumption that non-provable!=false.\n\nMhh. Ok here I am not completely sure. There is a lot of stuff in  \nthis question, and I can&#39;t unpack it all myself with my current  \nknowledge.\n\nOne way to look at it is to ask the question: does it make sense to  \nstate in an open world that non provable is false. The web is open,  \nso to treat it as closed would be a fundamental mistake.\n\nSecondly, efficiency has to do with algorithms for working on the  \ndata. You can of course decide to reason about the data given to you  \nas you wish. If making closed world assumptions in particular cases  \nis more efficient and mostly right, then you are completely free to  \ndo that.\n\nFinally I think part of the trick is to use graphs, again. Graphs are  \nreally, really important aspects of understanding the semantic web,  \nwhich is not apparent in the initial, very general, rdf  \nspecification, though in some sense it is there in full view. The  \nwhole semantic web requires the open world assumption, and so the  \nSemantic Web engineers were correct to use an open logic at the most  \ngeneral level. After all we should always be open about what we can  \nlearn, and we had better work within that framework if we are going  \nto scale to the web.\n\nWithin a graph though one can make statements about what appears  \nthere or does not.\n\nCONSTRUCT { ?p a :Vagabond . }\nFROM  &lt;http://bblfish.net/people/henry/card&gt;\nWHERE {  &lt;http://bblfihs.net/people/henry/card&gt; foaf:primaryTopic ?p .\n          OPTIONAL { ?p contact:home ?j } .\n          FILTER ( ! bound(?j) )\n}\n\nSo if you have extra information from somewhere that all foaf files  \non a certain place have contact information for everybody except  \nvagabonds, then feel free to use the above query.\n\n&gt; Dont get me wrong, I have to not only tolerate the Jena team as near\n&gt; neighbours, but even hang round with some of the RDF folk and consider\n&gt; when to use it appropriately. I just find some aspects of the whole\n&gt; model limited, even when you use the (richer) N3 notation...I think\n&gt; the underlying problem is there&#39;s no easy way to represent negativity\n&gt; in an open world, unlike prolog&#39;s horn-clause subset of first order\n&gt; predicate calculus.\n\nOk. So a lot has happened over the last few years. A lot of exciting  \nthings. It may be worth revisiting some of those assumptions :-)\n\nHenry\n\n\n&gt; -steve\n\n\n"}}
