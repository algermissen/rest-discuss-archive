So in case I&#39;m doing things wrong, please be\nforgivin=\r\ng.\n\nHowever, here is my first question:\n\nI would like to use asynchronous R=\r\nEST by POSTing a request to e.g.\n/backups  (for creating a new backup versi=\r\non), which will return me a\n202 with a location in the header. What should =\r\nthis location look like?\nI think it should look like /backups/version_x and=\r\n NOT be somewhere\nelse like /queue/backups/version_x or the like.\nHowever, =\r\nif a client starts polling now on /backups/version_x and the\nprocess hasn&#39;t=\r\n finished yet, what should be returned? A 404 with a\nbody until the process=\r\n is finished an the real representation can be\nsent with 200?\n\nUsing a new =\r\nresource like /queue/backups/version I could return a 200\nwith some status =\r\ninformation in it. However, the client initially\nrequested a representation=\r\n of a backup, but when it starts polling on\nthe new resource it receives an=\r\nother representation, the a status\nrepresenteation. How could a client adju=\r\nst to this situation without\nknowing in advance  that the action would be a=\r\nsynchronous??\n\nHmm, it&#39;s difficult to describe the problem. I hope it&#39;s\nund=\r\nerstandable somehow.\n\nregards,\nRoland\n\n\n"}}
