Now we&#39;re figuring out what interactions with the source\n&gt; should look like.  There are two general approaches on the table.\n&gt; \n&gt; Approach 1 is to have the GET of the watched resource contain a &quot;notify&quot;\n&gt; flag in the headers.  This is getting the watched resource and leaving a\n&gt; callback request at the same time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Approach 2 is to have two separate transactions, one to GET the watched\n&gt; resource and the other to POST to the subscription resource.\n&gt; \n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
