When they&#39;ve become popular\n&gt; we&#39;ve brought them to a standardization effort so that all can share in\n&gt; the IP. With this effort we&#39;re going to be both the project and the\n&gt; standards body.\n\n&quot;Pretty good history of running open communities and projects&quot;???\n\nThanks Bill, that was funny. There are few projects who have worse \nreputation when it comes to dealing with users (Marc&#39;s and Gavin&#39;s \n&quot;approach&quot; is infamous, not famous), spewing hyperbole left and right, \nfaking grassroot support, trying to enforce draconian contracts on \npartners, and so on. Have you forgotten this already?\n\nI&#39;m ashamed of having been a cofounder of such a deeply pathological and \nponerized project. If I could do it all over again I would have stayed \naway, and hopefully JBoss would never have existed.\n\nC&#39;est la vie.\n\n/Rickard\n\n"}}
