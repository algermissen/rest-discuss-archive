One \nstandards-compliant rendering of images is to display the contents of \nthe alt attribute in the appropriate place, and Lynx does that perfectly \nwell.\n\nThe bigger problem with images is that of people using graphical \nbrowsers who have difficulty seeing the particular image in question.\n\n\n"}}
