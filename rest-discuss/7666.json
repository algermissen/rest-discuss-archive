However, I&#39;m a little \n&gt; surprised at the amount of effort I&#39;m having to expend to get people to \n&gt; consider the question at all. The trouble people are going to evade it \n&gt; suggests to me that this is a very uncomfortable point for a lot of \n&gt; folks, and maybe the REST model (or at least HTTP) has some trouble\n&gt; here.\n&gt;\n&gt; So far I think the two or three folks who&#39;ve actually addressed the \n&gt; question square on have come down in favor of using POST despite the \n&gt; safety of the operation.\n\nI don&#39;t think that&#39;s fair.\n\nWhen you were talking about the use case of credit card numbers this\nwas a very familiar anti-pattern to me. Something that people suggest\nis confidential actually, on analysis, turns out not to be.\n\nI cannot think of a use case of the kind of thing that you&#39;re talking\nabout.\n\nSome things are confidential. Indeed I wouldn&#39;t want someone to look\nover my shoulder and notice the contents of many web pages that I look\nat on a daily basis (bank account, visa account, telephone bills,\netc...)\n\nBut I don&#39;t see that any of that has anything to do with GET or\nPOST. What&#39;s in the URL bar is the least of my concerns.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
