Bowman:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ll probably write a more detailed response over the weekend.  In\n&gt; short, REST is an idealized model of distributed hypertext system\n&gt; behavior.\n\nYes, I&#39;m absolutely aware of it. However, can we reach that &quot;ideal&quot; \nfully, or do we only try approximate it all the time? How can we then \nstate that when we would reach this &quot;ideal&quot;, that exactly this &quot;ideal&quot; \ncan emphasize the propagated features? Don&#39;t we need an exemplification?\nI think we can lead here this discussion even more into philosophy. \nAlthough, I guess, this is not really necessary here and not intended by \nthe aim of this mailing list.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The important bit, excerpted from Chapter 6, all-caps mine:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;\n&gt; The name &#39;Representational State Transfer&#39; is intended to evoke an\n&gt; image of how a well-designed Web application behaves: a network of web\n&gt; pages (a virtual state-machine), where the user progresses through the\n&gt; application by selecting links (state transitions), resulting in the\n&gt; next page (representing the next state of the application) being\n&gt; transferred to the user and rendered for their use.\n&gt;\n&gt; REST is not intended to capture all possible uses of the Web protocol\n&gt; standards. There are applications of HTTP and URI that do not match the\n&gt; application model of a distributed hypermedia system. The important\n&gt; point, however, is that REST DOES CAPTURE _ALL_ OF THOSE ASPECTS OF A\n&gt; DISTRIBUTED HYPERMEDIA SYSTEM THAT ARE CONSIDERED CENTRAL to the\n&gt; behavioral and performance requirements of the Web, such that\n&gt; optimizing behavior within the model will result in optimum behavior\n&gt; within the deployed Web architecture.\n&gt; &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; REST is not a result, it&#39;s a tool, which is why nobody gets an answer\n&gt; when asked for a link to a RESTful service\n\nIt&#39;s bad, when one gets no answer. It&#39;s like that I can claim everything \nand if someone asks why I claim this, then I would answer that I don&#39;t \nhave to answer you that or simple don&#39;t answer at all (no answer is also \nan answer).\nMaybe hypermedia/hypertext is now an old hat and we have now entered \nother dimensions of interaction design.\n\nSo if there are applications of HTTP and URI that do match the \napplication model of a distributed hypermedia system (which is obviously \nthe case), then there might be at least one which fulfils the \nconstraints of REST. Otherwise, how does we know that &quot;REST does capture \nall of those aspects of a distributed hypermedia system that are \nconsidered central to the behavioral and performance requirements of the \nWeb&quot;.\n\nAnyway, I tend now to be a bit more sceptical about the implementation \nof the whole set of architectural constraints of REST.\n\nBtw, &quot;while mismatches cannot be avoided in general, it is possible to \nidentify them before they become standardized&quot;. Non-RESTful REST \nimplementations are today a kind of de-facto standard, or?\n\nCheers,\n\n\nBob\n\n"}}
