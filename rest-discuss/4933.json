Having that resolution procedure\nwell-distributed in code is even better. :)\n\nThen it becomes a comparison of the protocols for doing resolution...\nit&#39;s nice if the protocol has provisions for working around common\ndistributed-system problems like temporary/permanent in-availability,\nredirection of resources, cache-control, proxying, &c.\n\nThere are definately circumstances where encoding the network-location\nof a resource into an identifier is not desirable, and thus we have\nthings like DOI.  Indirection via a service like http://purl.org/ can\nhelp mitigate some of the issues associated with encoding location into\nthe identifier.\n\nStill, sometimes location-independent schemes are a better idea.  One\nsucky thing is that all the data-providers then need to know to\n&quot;re-address&quot; identifiers they output in terms of the specific\nindirection-service, which then needs to be redirected, &c.  Depending\non how transparent the network protocol is, a proxy can do this\ntransformation, but that may be overkill for a particular system.  It\nmay also be more convenient for the system to internally store and use\nthe loc-indep. ident.\n\n...jsled\n\n-- \nhttp://asynchronous.org/ - `a=jsled; b=asynchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b}`\n\n"}}
