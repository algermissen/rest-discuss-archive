I think not.\n\nIt would help if you read the section in the RFC\non retries.  Obviously delivery CAN fail in either\nprotocol.  The difference is tolerance for\ntransient network outages.\n\n&gt; &gt; There is a whole section in the\n&gt; &gt; RFC on Retry.  HTTP does not define a retry\n&gt; &gt; policy.\n&gt;\n&gt; It *doesn&#39;t have to.*  And btw, RFC821 *does not contain the word &quot;retry&quot; **AT ALL.***  RFC1869,\n&gt; the service extensions, doesn&#39;t either.  Get your facts straight.\n\nUhm.  The current RFC is 2821.\n\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not so sure.  I bought into the zen of loose\n&gt; &gt; coupling in REST.  I am hoping you will see the\n&gt; &gt; bonus in asynch.  I think the two are very\n&gt; &gt; complimentary.\n&gt;\n&gt; Dude!  You don&#39;t have to sell me on asynch, I&#39;m totally sold --- over five years ago I was trying\n&gt; to explain to everybody that would listen that global-scale event notifications were indeed the\n&gt; next big thing.  That was the WHOLE PREMISE behind my last company, Activerse!  (Lesson learned:\n&gt; sell applications, not infrastructure.)  What you&#39;re failing to sell me on is the idea that HTTP\n&gt; applications don&#39;t need to communicate asynchronously (in-the-large, i.e. in a macro sense) over\n&gt; HTTP.\n\nOh.  Ok.  Then we are largely on the same page.\nI only arguing that HTTP asynch should provide all\nthe services I now get from SMTP.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
