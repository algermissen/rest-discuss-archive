I&#39;ve been following this list for quite some time, this is my first pos=\r\nt.\n\nI was looking at the AWS documentation and noticed that they have HTTP =\r\nAPIs (sometimes refering to them as REST APIs and all that).\n\nNow, the weir=\r\nd part is that it&#39;s not even method tunneling through POST payload and/or U=\r\nRI queries, but\n\na) They&#39;re using GET for everything [http://docs.amazonweb=\r\nservices.com/AmazonSimpleDB/latest/DeveloperGuide/APIUsage.html]\n(I found a=\r\n thread regarding this - &quot;SimpleDB: welcome to 1999&quot; [http://tech.groups.ya=\r\nhoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/9994] It&#39;s from 2007. So, I guess nothin=\r\ng&#39;s changed.)\n\nAND\nb) Method tunneling through a custom HTTP header [http:/=\r\n/docs.amazonwebservices.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/MakingHTTP=\r\nRequests.html]\ne.g:\n\nPOST / HTTP/1.1\nhost: dynamodb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com=\r\n\nx-amz-date: Mon, 16 Jan 2012 17:49:52 GMT\nx-amz-target: DynamoDB_20111205.=\r\nCreateTable\n\n\n\nIs there a reason for this design?\nWhat are the benefits?\n\nM=\r\naybe AWS are routing requests according to header value before the whole me=\r\nssage is received so that you don&#39;t have to parse the message to get the op=\r\neration method (as when using XML-RPC). Is that even a &#39;thing&#39;?\n\nBut why us=\r\ne HTTP if you&#39;re gonna misuse it? \n\nWhat do you think?\nYou know, am I missi=\r\nng something?\n\n \n\n\nThanks!\n\nDimitar A.\n\n\n"}}
