Suppose the\n&gt; &gt; following:\n&gt; \n&gt; i really like this model.  i think the crux of the matter is that \nthere\n&gt; are really two resources involved in the purchase order scenario.\n&gt; companyA looks at its order as a purchase order, and companyB looks \nat\n&gt; the same order as a /sales/ order.\n\nI like it too, but a single-Web-resource model will also work.  \nRegardless of what it was called, the single-resource would actually \nbe an &quot;Order&quot;, and the Purchase Order would be internal to the buyer \nand the Sales Order internal to the seller.\n\nOne consequence of having two resources is that their states are \nlogically connected, that is, you need state-alignment transactions \nfor subsequent interactions.  (This is not a killer requirement, you \nneed a protocol for agreement on changes in a single-resource model, \ntoo.)\n\nAnother aspect of Seairth&#39;s approach that I like is that it starts to \nfollow the Offer-Acceptance business protocol that we&#39;ve discussed \npreviously on this list.\n\nOrders are contracts and there are rules and customs for contract \nformation that need to be re-interpreted slightly for electronic \nbusiness, but still apply.  One of them is that a contract must be \nexplicitly agreed to by both parties.  (Same for changes.)\n\nThe submission of a PO in any form is an Offer to buy.  It is not the \nend of the conversation.  The seller may or may not accept it, for \nany of many reasons.\n\nSee also PurchasingBusinessRequirements on RestWiki:\nhttp://internet.conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/PurchasingBusinessRequi\nrements\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n\n"}}
