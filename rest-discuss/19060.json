Why create unnecessary URI coupl=\r\ning?\n\nBookmarking is an inherent aspect of RESTful systems. Bookmarking is =\r\nnot coupling. It is the other way round: because clients will bookmark, ser=\r\nvers pretty much have an implicit obligation to maintain URIs over time onc=\r\ne they &#39;got out&#39;.\n\nMay question was circeling around the issue whether this=\r\n ws more true for some URIs than for others.\n\nJan\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In rest-discu=\r\nss@yahoogroups.com, Jan Algermissen &lt;jan.algermissen@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; one of the obligations a server has in a RESTful system (IMHO\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; anyway) is to keep those URIs stable that make good bookmarks.\n&gt; &gt; (as in=\r\n &quot;Cool URIs don&#39;t change&quot;).

And hen=\r\nce, what URIs the\n&gt; &gt; clients might consider to be bookmarks?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Or i=\r\ns it as simple as\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Bookmarks are resource identifiers from a prior=\r\n interaction.\n&gt; &gt; They are bread-crumbs.
