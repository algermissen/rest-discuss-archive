I spent some time working through their\n&gt;&gt; API document, and it doesn&#39;t really seem all that\n&gt;&gt; complicated.  Or at least, it doesn&#39;t *have* to be.\n&gt; Did you look at any update APIs? Or just the query interfaces?\n\nOkay, you make a good point.  If a user is uploading/updating a  \ncomplex data structure, it is much easier to POST it One Fell Swoop,  \nthan have to send a bunch of key-values with hyperlinks to toMany  \nrelationships.\n\nAmazon is actually the exception that proves the rule: a well-defined  \ncommunity with good governance and a well-defined problem space,  \nwhich allows it to define and promulgate a formal XML Schema.\n\nI still stand by my earlier statement with regards to their query  \nAPI: if they had defined it with a unique non-query URI for each  \nresource, I think it would be clearer and easy to discover.

Take the example of the Yahoo REST\n&gt; service for video search whose response schema is at\n&gt; http://api.search.yahoo.com/VideoSearchService/V1/ \n&gt; VideoSearchResponse.xsd\n&gt;\n&gt; A typical request for this looks like below.\n&gt;\n&gt; http://api.search.yahoo.com/VideoSearchService/V1/videoSearch? \n&gt; appid=YahooDemo&query=madonna&results=1\n\nFor a query-type API, I think key-value inputs are sufficient, and  \nthus can (and should!) be represented by forms.\n\n&gt; While requests are simple URIs in REST services and dont really need a\n&gt; desciption,what about the responses? Most of them need an xml schema\n\nI disagree.  I actually think most responses can be represented  \nsufficiently well using XOXO (XHTML Outlines):\n\nhttp://microformats.org/wiki/xoxo\n\nAt the very least, I think that captures the 80% case.  It obviates  \nthe need for any parsing (or design!) of XML schemas, and allows  \ntrivial inspection of the relevant keys.\n\n-- Ernie P.\n\n------------\nErnest N.
