Then the PHM&#39;s \nwill come into play, reading an article on how good REST is (same as what \nhappened with CASE, EJB, SOA, ad nauseum) and how you can just layer an \nautomated tool to RESTify existing legacy systems (J2EE classes as legacy \nnow, doesn&#39;t it? ;-)  ), and then REST gains a bad rep, just like every other \nsilver bullet has in the past.\n\nI would prefer not to see that happen, though it may be unavoidable. ;-(\n\n&gt; I think this is the real issue; you can&#39;t just go around exposing all\n&gt; objects, you are going to have to make some conscious decision on what\n&gt; to expose and pick some way of controlling that. Whether this is via a\n&gt;  facade, annotations or something as simple as hacking package names\n&gt; won&#39;t really matter, but the work will still need to be done if such\n&gt; an approach is to be successful.\n\nExactly the point I was trying to make.  I think that this will be rarer than \nmany people think, and the temptation to &quot;retrofit&quot; REST onto older OO models \nthat lack such conscious design decision making will lead to disaster.\n\nIn the world of integration where I play, the back end object models are of \nlittle interest. What is of keen interest are the common data representations \nthat lie in the interfaces between such systems.  And it&#39;s been my experience \nthat in the longer term, those representations need a lot of design, thought \nand decision-making that is greatly independent of the participating systems.\n\n\nAndrzej Jan Taramina\nChaeron Corporation: Enterprise System Solutions\nhttp://www.chaeron.com\n\n\n"}}
