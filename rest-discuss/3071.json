But that said, it&#39;s a\ngood idea for the server to send chunks that are optimally sized for\nincremental processing/rendering to reduce effective latency as seen by\nthe client application.\n\nThis is what KnowNow does, as I understand it, where each chunk is an\nevent notification.  I have no problem with it whatsoever, though from\nan XML POV, it&#39;s slightly flawed because the composite stream (what you\nget when you concatenate all the chunks) is not well-formed XML because\nthere&#39;s no &quot;root container&quot;, like &lt;event-stream&gt; .. &lt;/event-stream&gt;.\nBut I&#39;m ok with that.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.
