In each framework, anywhere.\n&gt;\n&gt; You can *use* any of the frameworks in a stateless manner.  But in\n&gt; PHP, it is built-in.  And this appears to be significant not only for\n&gt; RESTfulness but also for hosting companies.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\nBob,\n\nThat property of PHP has little to do with Restfulness. Of all things\nto compare frameworks on, the fact that it runs like a CGI script is\nabout the least relevant.\n\nAnyway, the shared state of web apps lives in e.g. MySQL or on the\nlocal filesystem, so it&#39;s plenty easy to make a stateful session in\nPHP, just as easy and no harder than doing it in Django or JSPs.\nYou&#39;re just talking about another kind of shared state, the kind that\nlives in process memory. That&#39;s maybe the least interesting kind.\n\nNo matter what technique you use to subvert statelessness ... memory,\nfile system, rdbms... you have to set a cookie or decorate hyperlinks\nto connect that shared state up properly. PHP makes it just as easy to\ndo that as any other framework.\n\nWhat&#39;s a lot more relevant is how the framework divides up the URI\nspace. Most people use PHP, JSP/servlets, ASP, and CGI the same way:\nthe script lives at a given URI. That&#39;s the default, easiest way to\nuse these technologies. IOW the URI designates code, not a resource.\n\nDjango has a nice framework for dispatching based on Regexps. If you\nfollow this technique it&#39;s a lot more natural to identify resources\nwith a URI and attach the one script that takes some parameters, to a\nbunch of URIs.. .e.g. http://server.com/(&#92;w+)/(&#92;w+) could map the\nregex matches to variables like userName, pageId... or catalogId,\npartNumber... whatever.\n\nYou can do the same thing in the other frameworks, you just have to\nwrite the  code to dispatch based on the PATH_INFO. Django did this\nfor you.\n\nHugh\n\n"}}
