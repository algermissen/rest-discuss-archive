We have a Restfull (almost)\ninfrastructure that we use in order to put our different software\nmodules communicating with each other, sometimes using HTTP, other JMS\nor IMAP...\n\nAnd the rest of your post is similar to this quote, and I don&#39;t\nunderstand what it has to do with &quot;application&quot; and &quot;application\nstate&quot; in the realm of a RESTfull based system (not a HTTP based\nsystem).\n\nThere are things that we can extrapolate from HTTP to a more general\nlevel in order to fit other protocols, like we did with some HTTP\nheaders that we use generically, but not concepts like &quot;browser\nhistory&quot;.\n\nSo maybe I&#39;m contradicting myself regarding the conceptual/practical\ndichotomy I referred in other post, but concepts like &quot;application&quot;\nand &quot;application state&quot; have to be formally defined at the most\nabstract level as possible, so they can be applied on the ground.\n\n(and I&#39;m not saying they are not defined, for sure they are, I&#39;m\nreferring to the formal enunciation of the definition, but that is\nanother issue).\n\n"}}
