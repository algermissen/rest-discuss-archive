The good thing about\n&gt; doing that is that an intermediary would know that /search has changed\n&gt; state due to the POST, whereas if it went to /add, the state change\n&gt; would be transparent and the intermediary wouldn&#39;t know.\n\nhmm. Individual searches are separate resources; i.e., they have\ndifferent query strings, so this wouldn&#39;t necessarily work, no? (It\nwouldn&#39;t make sense to POST a query, obviously).\n\n\n&gt; Also, search may not be the best name if you&#39;re posting to it. \n&gt; /What about\n&gt; this?\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.example.org/database\n&gt; \n&gt; or, if the database is a list of employees;\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.example.org/employees\n\nYes. I knew that that was a problem, just didn&#39;t have a good\nmechanism; perhaps it would be good to have a DN-&gt;resource mapping,\nso that\n\nhttp://www.example.org/addresses\n\nmaps to &#39;dc=example,dc=org&#39; (if that&#39;s the DN being used for\naddresses. Then, individual entries could be maped to\n\n  http://www.example.org/addresses/Bob%20Smith\n\nor somesuch.\n\nThis might be a horrible abuse of LDAP, but hey, I&#39;d\nrather abuse it than the Web ;)\n\n\n&gt; An &quot;edit&quot; should be done with a PUT interface, no?  I know that this\n&gt; is problematic given that browsers/HTML only support GET/POST, but if\n&gt; you can afford it (development time, extra code to maintain, performance\n&gt; hit with another layer), I&#39;d solve that problem after exposing the PUT\n&gt; interface, perhaps by having a separate Wiki-looking URI that accepts\n&gt; POSTs and treats them as PUTs.\n&gt; \n&gt; e.g.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.example.org/employees?id=234343?pap=true\n&gt; \n&gt; (&quot;pap&quot; =&gt; &quot;post-as-put&quot;)\n\nSure. Perhaps start with pap and then backport. I&#39;m doing this with\npython&#39;s BaseHTTPServer, so I can do anything fairly easily ;)\n\n\n&gt; You can use them with URI refs;\n\nYes. What I&#39;m getting at is that the WIKI-like mechanisms such as \n\n  http://www.example.com/theThing\n  http://www.example.com/theThing?pap=true\n\nare a complete kludge; from a resource standpoint, these might as\nwell be\n\n  http://www.example.com/theThing\n  http:/www.example.com/someOtherThing\n\nbecause of opacity; the only person who knows that ?pap=true does\nsomething special is the publisher.\n\nP.S. it would be interesting to see an analysis of the RESTyness of\nWIKIs.\n\n\n-- \nMark Nottingham\nhttp://www.mnot.net/\n \n\n"}}
