First my assumption:\nPeople don&#39;t get REST, because one of the main ideas is that you need common \nstandard media types for REST. But people don&#39;t know about media types.\nI&#39;ve done web sites for 6 years but only now, while doing research for my \nbachelor thesis, I discovered how many great media types are there and could \nbe reused.\n\nAnd there is no advertisement for good media types. Where can I go and browse \n/ search / filter a list of media types and look whether there is already \nsomething registered for my need?\n\nRegards,\n\nThomas Koch, http://www.koch.ro\n\n"}}
