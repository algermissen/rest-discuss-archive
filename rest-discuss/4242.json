The COMMIT request\nincludes the etags of all the resources whose\nstate needs to be guaranteed by the transaction\nsystem.  Nice.\n\nMy suggestion for avoiding stateful transaction\nsession cookies is:\n\n1. Post a request to create a new transaction\nspace and get back a 201 CREATED with a location: transactionURI.\n\n2. Post URIs of resources you want involved with\nthe transaction to the transactionURI and get\nback 201 CREATED with location: scopedURI\nwhere scoped URI is the version of the resource\nwithin the scope of the transaction.\n\n3. When you are done POST COMMIT to the\ntransactionURI.\n\nNote: If you create transaction spaces this way,\nthe client also doesn&#39;t need to manage etags.\n\nThe big bonus of public transaction spaces is that\nthey have URIs!\n\n-Alex-\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nS.

Fielding wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Standard stuff, and stateful either way.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Huh? It is only stateful (by the common meaning in\n&gt; &gt; architecture) if the server is tracking what requests the\n&gt; &gt; client makes and answers accordingly. The transaction resource\n&gt; &gt; is building state on the server and the client is holding state\n&gt; &gt; in the form of entity tags, but the individual interactions are\n&gt; &gt; stateless.\n&gt;\n&gt; Fair enough. If the server always returns entity tags, then the\n&gt; client can remember for itself the tags of the entities that its\n&gt; actions have depended on, and can pass a list of URI/ETag pairs\n&gt; in the final COMMIT request (and optionally in earlier requests).\n&gt; As Alex pointed out, If-Match doesn&#39;t support matching on other\n&gt; resources, but as long as we&#39;re adding a Transaction-URI header\n&gt; we can add an If-Match-URI header.\n&gt;\n&gt; I still think a transaction header sounds like a stateful\n&gt; session cookie, though. :)\n&gt;\n&gt; Justin\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
