I&#39;m of the opinion that the main reason we use the word &quot;resource&quot;\n&gt; rather than the word &quot;thing&quot; is that using the former makes us seem a\n&gt; bit smarter than if we use the latter. However the nuances of &quot;thing&quot;\n&gt; are probably more apposite than the nuances of &quot;resource&quot;.\n\nWe use the term resource because &quot;thing&quot; includes those that have yet\nto be named or described, and thus cannot be individually considered\na resource by any system.\n\nShort terminology may lessen universal understanding, but at least\nit saves me from typing too many phrases.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
