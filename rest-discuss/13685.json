If it does, then you can think about  \nstandardising it.\n\nCheers,\n\nOn 06/10/2009, at 1:24 AM, Bill Burke wrote:\n\n&gt; Mark Nottingham wrote:\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m confused. Your site says:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; When our first specifications get released we will be submitting  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; them to the IETF.

Should we bake  independently, then move to  \n&gt; IETF or OASIS or something?
