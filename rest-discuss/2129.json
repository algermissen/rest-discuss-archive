Possibly. I think the discussion would be more\n&gt; interesting\n&gt; &gt; if someone would present a workable proposal how to implement\n&gt; this, without\n&gt; &gt; losing the PROPFIND/depth 1 functionality of WebDAV.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there any chance of the proposal making its way into software within\n&gt; our lifetimes or is it just for intellectual interest? ;)\n\nWell,\n\nI&#39;d imagine that this would just introduce a second way to access/modify\nmetadata, so it could be introduced in a backwards-compatible way. I&#39;m sure\nthat if the model is sound and has real benefits over PROPFIND,\nApache/moddav would adopt really fast...\n\n&gt; One could imagine combining the proposal with an idea unifying WebDAV\n&gt; properties with the RDF model.\n\nInteresting. Could you elaborate?\n\n\n"}}
