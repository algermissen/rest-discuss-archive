But it&#39;s not really asynchronous. It&#39;s just client\n&gt; polling.\nI think an order processing system wouldn&#39;t be sending data to a user\ninterface client like a browser. Without a browser involved, then\nsending a notification is almost equivalent to simply transfering the\nstate of a resource. With HTTP you could just use the known verbs and\nthe &#39;notification sender&#39; would be an http client sending\nput/post/delete and the &#39;subscribers&#39; are the http servers handling\nthose messages. There is no common approach to indicating these\ncallbacks (setting up subscriptions), but there have been several\ninformal proposals over the years. I&#39;m guessing hypertext is at the\nheart of any real solution.\n\nAnd if you truly want to get notifications to a web browser, there are\nseveral mechanisms - commonly called &quot;Comet&quot; (you know, like Ajax, but\na differnt cleanser...).\nThere are different approaches with browser based notifications\nregarding polling, piggybacking other requests, etc. Essentially these\nput a &#39;server on the client&#39;.\n\nI did a simple example that took the approach of having the server\nholding the connection open until a message arrives at the &#39;server&#39; -\nwhen that happens the server sends the message to the client (some\njavascript xmlhttprequest running in the background). Easy to bang out\nin a couple hours or days and gives very low latency delivery. Making\nit scale would be most interesting though (for example, keeping many\nconnections open would probably require a special server or using\nerlang).\n\nHere&#39;s a running example:\nhttp://www.dierken.com/xmlrouter/events/chat.html?topic=rest-discuss\n\nThe same approach would work for non-browser applications too.\n\n"}}
