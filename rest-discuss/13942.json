HTML supports the &quot;type&quot;\nattribute for link elements, but this is not passed as the accept\nheader by HTML browsers when resolving the link. XInclude introduced\nthe &quot;accept&quot; attribute for link elements and that _is_ passed as the\naccept header when resolving the link. It&#39;s a bummer that browsers\ndon&#39;t act the same way, but that&#39;s the way it goes.\n\nThere are other work arounds including minting URIs that give the\nserver enough info to override any accept header from the client:\n\n&lt;a href=&quot;/my-blog/rss&quot;&gt;RSS Feed&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;/my-blog/feed.atom&quot;&gt;Atom Feed&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;/my-blog;pdf&quot;&gt;PDF View&lt;/a&gt;\n\netc.\n\nTo paraphrase a man well-known for explaining somewhat unpleasant\nsituations, &quot;You go to the Web with the clients you have...&quot;&lt;g&gt;\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Oct 26, 2009 at 17:34, Will Hartung &lt;willh@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; On Mon, Oct 26, 2009 at 2:18 PM, Mike Kelly &lt;mike@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; An HTML document wishing to provide links to the blog &#39;page&#39; and the blog\n&gt;&gt; &#39;feed&#39;.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/blog&quot;&gt;My Blog Page (HTML)&lt;/a&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/blog&quot;&gt;My Blog Feed (Atom)&lt;/a&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Sure, but clearly, for a &quot;normal&quot; web browser, that fact that &quot;/blog&quot;\n&gt; replies in HTML is sufficient, right?\n&gt;\n&gt; If someone actually wanted an Atom feed, they&#39;d set the Accept header\n&gt; correctly, right? And there&#39;s no expectation that a web browser would\n&gt; do that, is there?\n&gt;\n&gt; With Firefox, if you use the in built RSS feed tool, it gives you a\n&gt; choice of which format to read. I don&#39;t use it, but since you, the\n&gt; user, are telling the browser what format you want, ideally it will\n&gt; ask for that format. (I have no idea what it does to try and\n&gt; subscribe).\n&gt;\n&gt; But when I see what you have above, identical URLs with different\n&gt; titles, clearly as a user if I click on either, I&#39;d get the same\n&gt; result since the actual client (the browser in HTML link click mode)\n&gt; will be pretty much mostly be interested in HTML, and that&#39;s what it\n&gt; will ask for.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you were building an automated client, then observation of the\n&gt; payload by a you (as human) will tell you where you can get an Atom\n&gt; feed (it says so, documented in English), and ideally you&#39;ll ask for\n&gt; that type explicitly.\n&gt;\n&gt; Do you want to add type information to the link to coerce the client\n&gt; to change its type?\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/blog&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot;&gt;My Blog Page (HTML)&lt;/a&gt;\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/blog&quot; type=&quot;application/atom+xml&quot;&gt;My Blog Page (Atom)&lt;/a&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Do you think that if you clicked on the second that the browser would\n&gt; view, or subscribe?\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Will Hartung\n&gt; (willh@...)\n&gt;\n\n"}}
