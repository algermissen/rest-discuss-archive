The view of that resource (i.e. the list of book=\r\ns returned) may vary based on the age of the reader (or any other criteria)=\r\n. Should I consider one ETag for the library as a whole or should I create =\r\nan ETag for each representation returned to each reader?\n\nMaybe another way=\r\n to ask the same question: should the ETag management solely be based on th=\r\ne resource or also influenced by other factors surrounding requests for it =\r\n(e.g. policies etc.)?\n\nCheers,\nHubert\n\n\n\n"}}
