Not enough\n&gt; &gt; to through out the baby with the bathwater though.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are a bunch of missing pieces.  WSDL for HTTP resources needs to\n&gt; happen.  Work on event models needs to get finished.  Maybe store and\n&gt; forward (the email workalike we discussed here a few months ago) needs to\n&gt; happen.\n\nWSDL for HTTP is -- as far as I can tell -- exactly as functional as\nWSDL for SOAP. That doesn&#39;t mean that WSDL is REST-ful, but it does mean\nthat your next sentence is misleading:\n\n&gt; SOAP-RPC already offers solutions to all of the above. \n\nHow does SOAP-RPC handle &quot;event models&quot;????\n\n&gt; ... They&#39;re not as\n&gt; good as HTTP solutions could be but at least they&#39;re out there.  Until the\n&gt; REST stack gets filled out to the same degree as the XML RPC stack, we are\n&gt; in ivory tower land.\n\nWe are already more filled out. WSDL is broken for HTTP but just as\nbroken for SOAP. UDDI is entirely useless for both. Our rough ideas at\nevent models are better than what I&#39;ve seen for SOAP. We have *some*\nform of authentication. Most important: we have an addressing and\nresource manipulation model. They don&#39;t even know that they lack one yet\n(despite that I&#39;ve been telling them for six months!).\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
