It&#39;s not* the routers and other lower-layer\ninfrastructure that will cause problems, it&#39;s HTTP application-layer\nintermediaries. They&#39;re unwilling to keep a persistent connection open for\nany period of time, because of the resources that it consumes, and their\nsensitivity to performance.\n\nMost common implementations will only keep a connection open for a few\nseconds; more radical approaches use an event loop instead of\nselect()/poll(), enabling them to hold many thousands of connections open,\nbut they&#39;ll still be closed if the workload is high.\n\nWhile it&#39;s true that you can use a separate HTTP connection to get the\nresponse back to the client, this leaves you with a sub-optimal choice; a)\nexpose an HTTP server on the client, and hope that it is accessible and\naddressable (in many of the situations where there is an HTTP\nintermediary, this isn&#39;t the case), or b) have the client poll the server\nfor the response. Icky.\n\n\n* Mostly. Firewalls also have resource limitations, especially if they&#39;re\ndoing NAT.\n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Ramin Firoozye&quot; &lt;ramin@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, July 23, 2002 10:35 AM\nSubject: RE: [rest-discuss] HTTP can&#39;t support web services\n\n\n&gt; Personally, I have never seen this happen and I suspect it&#39;s a little\nbit of\n&gt; a head-fake. The theory is that a TCP socket opened from client to\nserver,\n&gt; if inactive for an extended period of time, might be timed out by\nrouters\n&gt; that are doling out scarce resources. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a\n&gt; three-minute limit though.\n&gt;\n&gt; *If* that happens AND you have a (very badly designed)\ntransaction-oriented\n&gt; web-service, the request will be dropped from the client side before the\n&gt; server side has had time to respond, so the client might have to reissue\nthe\n&gt; request again and that will screw up the transaction. Again, I&#39;ve never\nseen\n&gt; this happen and I&#39;ve never heard of anyone complain about this, but\nmaybe I\n&gt; don&#39;t hang around the right people (:-)\n&gt;\n&gt; In practice, any reasonable transaction-oriented web-service will have\n&gt; multiple states, so you could have it go through an &#39;initialize -&gt;\ninvoke -&gt;\n&gt; commit&#39; cycle and if it doesn&#39;t finish all the way, you don&#39;t get the\nmoney\n&gt; deducted from your bank account.\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s a little like saying &#39;because some web-servers return error 404\nthey\n&gt; should not be used for serious purposes.&#39; HTTP is very useful for\n&gt; web-services. Just about any application that can do HTTP can become a\n&gt; client. An easy solution to Don&#39;s problem is to design proper stateful\n&gt; web-services (but I&#39;m guessing Don and Microsoft already knew this (;-)\n&gt;\n&gt; Ramin\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Ramin Firoozye -  Wizen Software\n&gt; ---\n&gt;   -----Original Message-----\n&gt;   From: Jeffrey Winter [mailto:j.winter@...]\n&gt;   Sent: Tuesday, July 23, 2002 9:54 AM\n&gt;   To: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;   Subject: [rest-discuss] HTTP can&#39;t support web services\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   A while back, Don Box (of Microsoft) gave a talk in which he stated\nthat\n&gt;   HTTP couldn&#39;t support\n&gt;   long-term transactions, one specific reason was because of issues with\n&gt;   intermediaries.\n&gt;   An article about his talk is here:\n&gt;\n&gt;      http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1105-845220.html\n&gt;\n&gt;   The specific comment from the article is:\n&gt;\n&gt;   &quot;...when Web services start running transactions that take some time\nto\n&gt;   complete over the protocol, the model fails. &quot;If it takes three\nminutes\n&gt; for\n&gt;   a response, it is not really HTTP any more,&quot; Box said. The problem,\nsaid\n&gt;   Box, is that the intermediaries--that is, the companies that own the\n&gt; routers\n&gt;   and cables between the client and server--will not allow single\n&gt; transactions\n&gt;   that take this long.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;   What exactly is it about the intermediaries that wouldn&#39;t allow for a\nlong\n&gt;   transaction time?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;         Yahoo!
