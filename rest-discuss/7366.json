My operation has succeeded. Whatever else the\n&gt; server chooses to do with my submission is up to it. I don&#39;t see any\n&gt; need to redirect a client to a specific new document version in order to\n&gt; allow their PUT operation to proceed.\n\nIt does seem to be a bit of a bone of contention. If we assume that\n/mydocument *does* change, i.e. that it is equivalent to\n/mydocument;current or maybe /mydocument?revision=current , and always\nreflects the state of the last change, then the PUT to /mydocument is\nonly idempotent with respect to /mydocument and not to the entire\nnamespace. This is a problem since RFC 2616 defines an idempotent method\nin terms of its side-effects not its direct effects, if you see what I\nmean.\n-- \nChris Burdess\n\n"}}
