Thanks in advance.\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n[1] For example consider an intermediary that sends out a bunch of requests\nper URI that it finds in RDF documents running through it, leading to maybe\nhundreds or thousands of requests triggered by a single one through the\nintermediary. Oh, and of course the intermediary is likely to send its own\nrequests through intermediaries of the same kind...\n\n\n-- \nJan Algermissen                           http://www.topicmapping.com\nConsultant & Programmer\t                  http://www.gooseworks.org\n\n"}}
