For one thing, it won&#39;t be of any use to anyone but this particular \n&gt;&gt; user.  Sort of like if I print out the web page -- that piece of paper is a \n&gt;&gt; new resource, but it need not have a URI since (aside from being a physical \n&gt;&gt; object, and not network-addressable) it only matters to me here & now.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; If someone needs to know about it, then it needs a URI. There are many \n&gt; servers and many clients, and one machine may be both in its life. There are \n&gt; also semantic web and other applications that use URIs for identification \n&gt; rather than location and resolution. Even if a URI is only of use to one user \n&gt; (a supposition I suspect is very limiting in itself) it still needs a URI. \n&gt; Most obviously, that one user may still want to bookmark it.\n&gt; \nI suspect that we will see more and more pages that are &quot;composed&quot; of various \nservices accessed by a page asynchronously (usually w/ XHR) and although my \nexample happens to get all of the data from the same server, that needn&#39;t \nalways be the case (same-origin policy aside...).  You can just say AJAX is not \nRESTful and leave it at that, but that&#39;d be a shame, since REST has plenty of \ngood design principles to offer such a design.\n\nFor me it comes down to this:  The CLIENT needs to know &quot;who&quot; the user is \nacross multiple requests (application state, which is A-OK as long as it lives \non & is controlled by the client) so it can fire XHRs which are asking for THIS \nuser&#39;s data.  The two choices are a cookie (which I contend is not unRESTful if \nused in this way) OR always including the user-id in the page URL so that the \nserver can encode that user-id in the hypertext which the client can then use \nto get more (personalized) data.\n\nI can imagine a page that offers a user a menu of services, and as each is \nselected, a cookie is set (by the CLIENT, using javascript) that causes that \nservice & the data it offers added to the page by way of XHR.  As long as the \ncookie is still there, the user always sees their own &#39;view&#39; of the page. And \nthe server knows nothing of the cookie(s) -- they are totally controlled by the \nuser.  My contention is that this a RESTful use of cookies -- I fear that the \nanti-cookies p.o.v. throws out some baby w/ the bathwater.\n\nBy leveraging the intelligence of the client (the ability to set/keep/expire \ncookies) the application that sits on the server can be dramatically simplified \nas compared to the application that needs to keep track of all of the different \n&quot;resources&quot; that represent user preferences. The application is essentially a \n&quot;services engine&quot; that the client mixes & mashes as they wish....\n\n-peter\n\n\n\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\n&gt; Java I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\n&gt; http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\n&gt; http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n&gt;\n\n"}}
