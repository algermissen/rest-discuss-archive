Mike Dierken &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This model seems to introduce some incidental complexity (see\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.computer.org/proceedings/icre/0565/05650130abs.htm).\n&gt; Instead\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of just representing an account as a single abstraction, we now \nhave\n&gt; an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; account resource, an account-credit abstraction and an account-\ndebit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; abstraction.\n&gt; &gt; Would you consider that the account-credit abstraction is just\n&gt; transfering\n&gt; &gt; complexity of the &#39;deposit()&#39; concept to a different place in the\n&gt; design?\n&gt; &gt; So it&#39;s not so much an addition as a transfer?\n&gt; \n&gt; I think it does add complexity, though.  With a new resource you \nhave a\n&gt; new URI to keep track of, and you have to know which methods are \nvalid\n&gt; for it (what happens if I &quot;get&quot; from this resource?), the \nparameters it\n&gt; accepts, what each of the methods returns, etc.  \n\nI intend to revert to the human-understandable version here, that is, \ndeposits and withdrawals.  (Debit and credit require me to buy into \naccounting jargon.)\n\nI want each of my deposits and withdrawals to have its own identity.\nIf I am working with my account (like balancing my checkbook), I want \nto be able to work with each item individually.\n\nI think it is the same with any other composite object model:  each \nof the sub-objects in the composite has its own identity. \n\nFor example, in orders, I want to be able to work with each line item \nindependently sometimes.  Likewise each delivery and payment.  \n\nWhether modeled as resources or objects or database tables, each \nelement will have its own identity as well as being represented in \nrepresentations of &quot;the whole&quot;, e.g. the state of the account or \norder.\n\nI can&#39;t think of any business object models I&#39;ve worked with, where \nthe sub-objects were not also first-class objects with their own \nidentity.\n\nAnd with objects, using the Composite pattern, every object in the \ncomposite has the same set of methods.\n\n\nIn other words, I don&#39;t see such a great divide between objects and \nREST resources.  I see a much bigger divide between REST and RPC-\nstyle SOAP, which reminds me more of C.\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
