I&#39;ll be\n&gt; hosting it, though due more to my own desire to learn more rather\n&gt; than to any particularly deep knowledge of REST lore on my part. The\n&gt; precise time hasn&#39;t been set yet, but as soon as it is, I&#39;ll post it\n&gt; here (assuming that I&#39;m still able to.) The conference will be in\n&gt; Boston from November 18-22.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m really hoping that this will be a chance for REST advocates to\n&gt; get their message a little further into the industry mainstream.\n&gt; Please make a note if you&#39;re planning to attend the conference or if\n&gt; you&#39;ll be in the Boston area in that timeframe.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-explore-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
