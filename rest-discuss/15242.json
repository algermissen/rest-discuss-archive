I&#39;m still on the &quot;G&quot; of Grokking it myself :)\n\nAnd I agree with Eric in that, apparently in spite of how much or well\ngrok&#39;d REST is, for many transactions the effort involved isn&#39;t\nnecessarily worth it. As has been said, REST is designed for large,\nlong living systems. Most systems don&#39;t even fall under that banner.\nOr, typically, you don&#39;t recognise the new system as being large and\nlong lived until 5 years later where it has morphed and snowballed in\nto some monstrosity underneath the mutating forces of business needs\nwith very short schedules. But even then, it&#39;s not necessarily worth\nthe up front effort to do a full boat REST system for such an,\ninitially, small system.\n\nWhen REST is better grok&#39;d, when the patterns of implementation and\nsolutions of business cases get better documented and propagated, then\nREST systems will be, ideally, easier to develop. I still need to get\nthe Cookbook, but I think efforts like that are a good start.\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n(willh@...)\n\n"}}
