A fixed URL scheme is essentially\n&gt;&gt; the same as baking the first representation into each client.\n&gt;\n&gt; Right. I think some people, when thinking about bootstrap problems\n&gt; (which is what we&#39;re talking about here), end up in logical knots and\n&gt; fallacies, or worse, invent pointless discovery technologies to solve a\n&gt; non-problem. The first link is always out of band, get over it.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Is that surprising?\n&gt;\n&gt; Obviously not, but it seemed fair to point it out.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bill\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
