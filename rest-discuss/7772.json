The answer is clearly &quot;no&quot;.\n\nNow, when we consider the other rule about &quot;If the request would, \nwithout the If-Match header field, result in anything other than a 2xx \nor 412 status, then the If-Match header MUST be ignored.&quot; this means \nthat if the request is GET we will get a 404, but with PUT we will get a \n412 (I&#39;m simplifying my assuming that there are no other factors \naffecting the status code returned).\n\n\n"}}
