Yes the user just discovers at\n&gt; runtime the representation-types and possible next application states\n&gt; and always uses the same uniform interface and so on etc pp. For him\n&gt; _everything_ is just a resource (representation).\n&gt;\n\nYes.\n\n&gt; It&#39;s a different thing when we talk about the design of the system.  \n&gt; The\n&gt; developer view. Clearly in any RESTful application you _will_ have\n&gt; different types of resources, no matter how you call it: A resource of\n&gt; type &quot;article&quot; _will_ have different underlying business logic /\n&gt; properties / behaviors etc than for example a resource of type\n&gt; &quot;customer&quot;. These different resource types must be implemented in  \n&gt; _some_\n&gt; way. What representations does it serve? What methods does this  \n&gt; resource\n&gt; type allow? With which adressing-schema (URI-templates) is it  \n&gt; adressable?\n&gt; For example you might use a java-class ArticleResource to implement a\n&gt; resource of type article. At runtime these class can manifest  \n&gt; itself in\n&gt; many different resource instances. Anyways - however you do it, you  \n&gt; have\n&gt; to have some notion of resource types. I don&#39;t see why not just  \n&gt; call it\n&gt; &quot;resource types&quot;?\n&gt;\n\nBecause those implementations behind the interface are not the same\nas the resources exposed through the interface.  Even in the simple\ncase, where an http URI template maps to a filesystem hierarchy, we\ndo not say that the individual files are the resources.  (They are\nresources of their own accord, but they are not the resources exposed\nvia HTTP.)  They are just storage mechanisms that supply representations\nwhen mapped from a URI.\n\nI think I misunderstood Stefan&#39;s original question, though.\nURI templates describe a naming pattern, not a resource type\nor even set of resources.  Templates define a set of names.\nAnd, yes, RDF (or anything that defines link relations) could\ndescribe an assertion that some resource has some defined type, and\nmight even be extended some day to support templates in place\nof URIs, but it is wrong to think of RDF descriptions as being\ndefinitive of resources.  They are usually wrong in the long run.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
