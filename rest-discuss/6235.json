I was just having a conversation with my\n&gt; coworker (we run a big e-commerce site) about how torn we are about\n&gt; having to use cookies. It seems like a necessity. We used to do\n&gt; sessioning in the url but users would copy and paste their url to their\n&gt; friends. Now their friends would jump into their session and potentially\n&gt; be able to buy things on their credit card (yeay one click shopping) and\n&gt; cause all kinds of problems. Does ReST address this?\n&gt; \n(I read all of the posts and decided to reply to the original)\n\nI like to think that cookies and HTTP authentication are means used to \ngive access to a resource, not provide information about the resource. \nMetamorphically speaking, on a computer everybody sees the same file, \nbut whether or not you are allowed to access it depends on your security \nidentifier. Cookies and HTTP Authentication should be used in the same \nway. Everybody sees the same resource identifier, but the cookie or HTTP \nauthentication identifier says whether or not you are allowed to access \nthe resource.\n\nIf you use cookies in that fashion I don&#39;t see anything wrong with cookies.\n\nNow about security and privacy...  At SD me and Alan Holub had a really \nlong discussion about this. The answer is that only by using hardware \nbased security (client and server side) can you ensure who is accessing \nwhat data and when. Whenever you are using software you are creating a \nweakness that can be exploited.\n\nThough one thing that struck me in this conversation was that Alan kept \nsaying, &quot;Don&#39;t do this yourself many smart people have already thought \nabout this&quot;. For example you could use SSH, STunnel (SSL Tunneling) or \nOpenVPN (virtual private network) to keep things private. There are a \nhost of solutions and developers should use them, and not create new ones.\n\nChristian\n\n\n\n"}}
