Whether you choose to view a\n&gt;&gt; document in a PDF or HTML or perhaps even as a PNG has no bearing on the\n&gt;&gt; application. The application state is always the same for the same URI\n&gt;&gt; irrespective of the content type.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; Hi Dhananjay,\n&gt;\n&gt; Why would application state always be the same for all representations of a\n&gt; resource?\n\n\nAn application state reflects where the user is in the overall workflow\nsupported / managed by the application. It is therefore not dependent upon\nthe representation. eg. if I am being shown an itinerary for my approval\nprior to a final booking, I am in the state of reviewing the itinerary -\nirrespective of whether the itinerary was being rendered as XHTML, JSON,\nXML, PDF or PNG.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  b) How is a bookmark adequately defined ? This is really a question for\n&gt;&gt; the author of a browser to answer. If we had a browser which say allowed you\n&gt;&gt; to also describe the accept headers before making the URI, then let us for a\n&gt;&gt; moment suggest that such a browser the bookmark perhaps could contain the\n&gt;&gt; accept header. However we don&#39;t have such browsers (I haven&#39;t seen one at\n&gt;&gt; least). But it is likely that programmatic clients may want to choose to\n&gt;&gt; store such URIs for say resuming later. Such a browser is again unlikely to\n&gt;&gt; &#39;break&#39; if it is able to accept and parse various content types with equal\n&gt;&gt; capability or works with only one content type which it always specifically\n&gt;&gt; requests. However it could break if in a particular situation it has\n&gt;&gt; requested a particular resource with a non default accept headers and that\n&gt;&gt; is specifically needed to resume further. In such a situation, perhaps the\n&gt;&gt; bookmark could store the accept header.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; That is, essentially, what I was suggesting\n\n\nYes, thats what I had assumed you were referring to - I was on the other\nhand attempting to separate the notion of the bookmark and the application\nstate - ie. they are not one and the same.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  But even in this case the accept headers imo are not an attribute of the\n&gt;&gt; application state - they are an application of the conversation state\n&gt;&gt; (though I am open to be challenged since I myself am not so terribly\n&gt;&gt; convinced about it).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t know if I understand what you mean by &#39;application of the\n&gt; conversation state&#39; - but there is no room for a state between application\n&gt; and resource, given communication in RESTful systems is (supposed to be)\n&gt; stateless.\n\n\nSorry, made a mistake there - should&#39;ve stated &quot; the accept headers imo are\nnot an attribute of the application state - they are an *attribute* of the\nconversation state&quot;. Though reading it again I feel a little lame. I\nshould&#39;ve been more specific and should&#39;ve said &quot;the accept headers imo are\nnot an attribute of the application state - they are merely the influencers\nof a representation as a part of a given conversation&quot;\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Mike\n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------\nblog: http://blog.dhananjaynene.com\ntwitter: http://twitter.com/dnene\n\r\n--000e0cd53b1c2277a7046fac4c07\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Mon, Jul 27, 2009 at 2:29 PM, Mike Ke=\r\nlly &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:mike@...&quot;&gt;mike@mykanj=\r\no.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; style=3D=\r\n&quot;border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padd=\r\ning-left: 1ex;&quot;&gt;\nDhananjay Nene wrote:&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;blockquote cl=\r\nass=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); mar=\r\ngin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOn Wed, Jul 22, 2009=\r\n at 6:39 PM, Mike Kelly &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:mike@...&quot; target=3D=\r\n&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mike@...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;mailto:&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:mike@mykanjo.c=\r\no.uk&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mike@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n =\r\n=A0 =A0Is a state transition adequately defined by:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0GET /r=\r\nesource&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0or is it more appropriate to include the entire of=\r\n the message? i.e.:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0GET /resource&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0Accept: appl=\r\nication/pdf&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0Accept-Language: en-us&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0.... etc&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n =A0 =A0If browsers treated each state as the full HTTP message, bookmark=\r\ns&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0and page refreshes would not &#39;break&#39;.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =\r\n=A0As it stands; if a browser refreshed or bookmarked the latter&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =\r\n=A0state, the Accept header would revert back to default (text/html,&lt;br&gt;\n =\r\n=A0 =A0etc..) because the only part of the state transition stored is the&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n =A0 =A0URI/Verb combination.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0- Mike&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n =A0 =A0Dhananjay Nene wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0Not sure if I am th=\r\ne only one .. but couldn&#39;t really&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0understand the qu=\r\nestion.
