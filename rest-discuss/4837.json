This fundamentally subverts the reason for having different\n&gt; &gt;  HTTP methods in the first place...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  REST as realized by the Web is (thankfully) about more than GET and\n&gt; &gt;  POST.\n&gt; \n&gt; These resources would *only* be used by crippled HTML browsers.\n&gt; Programmatic access by developers not using a browser could use the\n&gt; appropriate HTTP methods on the actual resources.\n\n&gt; Sandeep said that he &quot;interpreted&quot; POST-s to these &quot;browser specific\n&gt; resources&quot; as PUT-s to the actual resources. In fact, theres&#39; no reason\n&gt; why you can&#39;t actually implement code that does an actual PUT or DELETE\n&gt; or whatever to the &quot;real&quot; resource when a POST is made to one of the\n&gt; &quot;fake&quot; resources.\n&gt; \n&gt; This isn&#39;t a limitation of the REST architectural style but a limitation\n&gt; of some of the tools we have to deal with (I&#39;m considering the browser a\n&gt; tool).\n\n\nExactly! You can PUT/GET/POST/DELETE on the real resource and this is\nwhat programmatic clients would do and depending on conneg they would\nget the appropriate representation. This means that the handling on\nthe server side is based on uniform semantics and the hacks can be\ntaken out anytime without affecting its behaviour which is RESTful. I\narrived at this solution after seeing countless implementation when a\nweb-based server would need new wrapper code around it to make it a\nweb-service. With my approach (that uses conneg appropraitely) there\nis just one codebase that is based on uniform semantics and as a\nweb-service developer/modeller you think only in terms of REST.\n\nSandeep Shetty\n\n"}}
