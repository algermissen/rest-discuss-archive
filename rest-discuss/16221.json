Some developers would like to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; go direct to the status to avoid the hop. One way to do this is have the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; URLs prepared in advance. The argument is that a way to balance these\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; concerns is to allow the server to publish a document that client can\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; cache and from which the client can pull the status url directly and so\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; short circuit the traversal without being very strongly coupled to the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; server&#39;s uri space. This kind of tradeoff seems reasonable to me, hence\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t understand the level of objection in some quarters to approaches\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; like WADL.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Why use WADL for that? Seems unnecessary when can achieve the same\n&gt; &gt;&gt; thing with just a Link header.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; How?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bill\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; By serving a cacheable representation that includes the appropriate\n&gt; &#39;short circuit&#39; link (and relation) in its Link header.\n\nOh so for every related resource I serve a Link header with relations? A\ncouple of things come to mind\n\n- I can&#39;t compress headers. This actually matters in mobile systems.\n\n- I need to do a ton of testing to see whether Link will go through\ngateways and proxies on mobile systems. \n\n- I now have a management problem as to where to put relations (headers\nor document? both? This kind of thing drives developers insane.\n\n- I know have even more indirection due to Extension Relation Types to\ngo off and read the document that &#39;explains&#39; the link type.\n\n - I can&#39;t cache the Links and representation independently (cue lots of\nHEAD requests).\n\nNo offence, but Link in this scenario seems like a way to avoid RDF at\nany cost (or avoiding admitting documents with actual semantics are\nimportant). Which brings me back to interlingua and just serving a\ndescription document (WADL or otherwise). \n\nI&#39;m not seeing a clear win, theoretically or practically.\n\nBill\n\n\n\n\n"}}
