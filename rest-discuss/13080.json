(This doesn&#39;t seem like an uncommon case;\n&gt; I would think that navigation links, for example, would typically not be\n&gt; modifiable in a PUT.)\n\nIMO, you seem to be confusing between the state of the resource and\nits representation. GET and PUT allow you to retrieve and set the\nstate of the resource. The data format used for transferring that\nstate is the media type. &quot;Navigation links&quot; are specific to the media\ntype and not the state of the resource. I could PUT\napplication/atom+xml or application/x-www-form-urlencoded and GET\ntext/html.\n\n-- \nSandeep Shetty\nhttp://sandeep.shetty.in/\n\n"}}
