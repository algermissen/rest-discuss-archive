This is my first time\n&gt; posting to the group.  In our lab we are trying to go with a web-based\n&gt; approach to expose some of the image processing functionality being\n&gt; developed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some examples of what the processing would output are transformations\n&gt; on the images themselves and some sort of feature extraction.  There\n&gt; seems to be a high need to have a mechanism that will allow multiple\n&gt; image processors operate on an input in a chain.  \n&gt; \n&gt; As an experiment I wanted to build a JSON-formated, RESTful image\n&gt; resize service.  Can you guys suggest what it would look like?  I am a\n&gt; little confused on how something that is very verb based like resizing\n&gt; can be modeled as nouns.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I would like to use multipart/mixed to bundle JSON data with multiple\n&gt; binary images.\n&gt; \n&gt; I wanted to use CID&#39;s, to reference files from the JSON, but I am not\n&gt; sure how to make web-browsers support that.  To compensate I am just\n&gt; referencing files in order of the message...\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s what I am thinking: \n&gt; \n&gt; POST /resizedImages/ HTTP/1.1\n&gt; Content-Length: 550818\n&gt; Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=BbC04y\n&gt; --BbC04y\n&gt; { &quot;entries&quot;: [ \n&gt;   { &quot;image&quot;:1, &quot;resized-width&quot;:&quot;640&quot; },\n&gt;   { &quot;image&quot;:0, &quot;resized-width&quot;:&quot;480&quot;, &quot;resized-height&quot;:&quot;640&quot; },\n&gt;   ]\n&gt; }\n&gt; --BbC04y\n&gt; Content-Disposition: form-data; name=&quot;image&quot;; filename=&quot;file2.gif&quot;\n&gt; Content-Type: image/gif\n&gt; \n&gt;    ...contents of file2.gif... \n&gt; --BbC04y\n&gt; Content-Disposition: form-data; name=&quot;image&quot;; filename=&quot;file1.jpg&quot;\n&gt; Content-Type: image/jpeg\n&gt; \n&gt;    ...contents of file1.jpg... \n&gt; \n&gt; Any suggestions will be appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Joe\n&gt; \n\nHi Joe,\n\nBy coincidence, I brought up a related issue this morning on a GIS \ndiscussion list:\n\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/geo-web-rest/t/7a2aec463ae4a2cb\n\nHere&#39;s the way remote processing (vector or raster) is done now in the \nGIS industry:\n\n- Post data to a RPC endpoint, along with processing instructions \nencoded in XML;\n- Get transformed data in response.\n\nThe alternative is a to take an approach that is a bit like Yahoo Pipes. \nCreate a processing resource at a URL like\n\nhttp://example.com/processing/resize\n\nand then pull imagery through it like\n\nGET \nhttp://example.com/processing/resize?image=http://zcologia.com/images/kirok.jpg&width=200&height=200\n\nCheers,\nSean\n\n\n"}}
