Since the\n&gt; &gt; resource the PUT is applied to is not changed in your example, the\n&gt; &gt; PUT does not succeed.\n&gt;\n&gt; I disagree.....the Put succeeded based on the definition of what the\n&gt; application expected to happen. Which is to create a new version of the\n&gt; resource, in the scenario we&#39;ve been discussing.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think you are reading the specs a bit too literally.\n\nThat depends: if the versioning is visible on the URI, then you must\nbe strict with the HTTP specs - that is to say, if the client is\nexpected to provide /foo{version-number}\n\nIf however, the versioning is private and thus not visible on the URI\nthen you can send a 201 and be correct.\n\nI suspect that your problems lie in not being clear about the URI\nsemantics of what you provide.\n\nMy vote goes for:\n\n--&gt;\nPUT /foo\n\n&lt;--\n302 Found\nLocation: /foo{version-number}\n\n--&gt;\nPUT /foo{version-number}\n\n&lt;--\n201 Created\n\nYes, I know it involves an extra roundtrip, but it preserves the HTTP\nsemantics - therefore the client can choose if the follow the 302 and\ncan use the If-xxx headers as desired.\n\nAlan Dean\n\n"}}
