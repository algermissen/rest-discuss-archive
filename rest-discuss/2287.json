I think a lot of the current discussion focuses on &quot;how to do \n&gt; &gt; &gt; RPC in REST&quot; rather than &quot;use cases for which REST is a clear \n&gt; &gt; &gt; advantage&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yep.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think this mischaracterisizes the original discussion a \n&gt; bit.  The underlying issue was more along the lines of how \n&gt; to *avoid doing* RPC in REST.\n&gt; \n&gt; If there are &quot;use cases for which REST is a clear advantage,&quot; this \n&gt; would imply that there are cases where it isn&#39;t.  What are those\n&gt; cases?\n\nWell? What are some use cases where REST should not be used? Since I&#39;m\nadvocating a RESTful implementation of Linda tuple spaces, I&#39;d like to\nknow if my use cases falls into this category!\n\n&gt; Understanding what those boundaries are (and I can&#39;t think of any) \n&gt; would be very illuminating.\n\nHmmm... No cases where REST should not be used? This sounds like religious\nenthusiasm to me....\n\nSam Hunting\neTopicality, Inc.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&quot;Turn your searching experience into a finding experience.&quot;(tm)\n\nTopic map consulting and training: www.etopicality.com\nFree open source topic map tools:  www.goose-works.org\n\nXML Topic Maps: Creating and Using Topic Maps for the Web.\nAddison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-74960-2.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}}
