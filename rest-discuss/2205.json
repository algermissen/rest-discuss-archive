I recognize that you are\ninterested\nin a business-level contract, i.e., &quot;contract as REST resource&quot;.  When I\nsaid there was\nno contract, I meant at the application protocol level inside POST.  In\nother words, you\nmight compose hypertext entity C and POST it to some business resource as a\ncontract\nwork in progress, and that resource may\n \n    a. declare itself on vacation and do nothing with your submittal except\nto\n        notify you that no action is being taken\n \n    b. take your contract proposal and publish it as a resource to be\nmodified\n        collaboratively until both sides are ready to sign it.\n \nThe contract I assert does not exist is the contract to recognize another\ncontract\nand host it.  And in business, this is also the case, is it not?\n \nBy the way, I think the problem here is one of HTTP, not REST.  REST says\nthere\nare generic methods, i.e, methods that conceivably apply to all resources.\nHTTP says\nthere is a POST method, and then makes some statements for us to interpret.\n \n    If REST, by calling for generic methods, implies in the meaning of\n&#39;generic&#39;\n    that method semantics are clearly defined and understood, then the POST\n    method of HTTP may violate REST a little.  The generality of POST is so\ngreat\n    that the semantic visibility of POST requests to intermediaries is\nhighly\n    questionable, and hence the desired &quot;induced&quot; architectural property is\npartly\n    missing.  Another way of saying this is that POST is a built-in tunnel\n    for doing RPC over HTTP.  The exception being that you really shouldn&#39;t\n    use it for data retrieval (GET).\n \nIf you want explicit, reliable sub-resource creation through the protocol,\nyou can\ndefine a method with those semantics, and that would violate neither REST\nnor\nHTTP as far as I know.  Heck, what&#39;s to stop you from extending HTTP methods\nwith the set from SQL?  Then you know precisely what INSERT means.\n \nWhat do you think?\n \nWalden\n \n \n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: bhaugen32 [mailto:bhaugen32@...]\nSent: Friday, August 23, 2002 7:49 AM\nTo: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [rest-discuss] Re: PUT, POST, authorization and purchase orders\n\n\n\nWalden Mathews wrote:\n&gt; First of all, I don&#39;t recall telling you you were wrong, and if I \ndid, you should probably\n&gt; attach no significant to that at all.  Right now I&#39;m experimenting \nwith holding up an impossibly\n&gt; strict interpretation of REST to see what happens to my \nunderstanding, with apologies\n&gt; to all innocent bystanders.\n\nDon&#39;t mind me, I&#39;m just flailing about trying to get unconfused.\nWe&#39;re pretty much in the same boat, trying different ways to \nunderstand what seem to be powerful ideas that are a different from \nwhat (at least I&#39;m) used to.\n\n&gt; On this issue of data-accepting resource types, Mark has created \nthe taxonomy in order\n&gt; to help us understand the range of possible responses w.r.t. \nresource creation and so\n&gt; forth, but there can be no such thing as &quot;knowing a resource is \nthis type or that&quot;, \n\nI thought that&#39;s what RDF was for.\nI also wonder if anybody has bent HTTP Header content-type in this \ndirection?  (Can&#39;t get to Mark&#39;s articles right now to see if he \nmentioned this possibility. I think I remember somebody doing so in a \nprevious message in this list, but can&#39;t find that, either.)\n\n&gt; because\n&gt; the resource is free to handle POST as it sees fit.  In other \nwords, &quot;IdentityPreservingResource&quot;\n&gt; may be what it&#39;s doing sometimes, but it&#39;s not a contract with \nyou.  At least that&#39;s the\n&gt; understanding I&#39;ve come away with.\n\nI want to be able to negotiate legally binding contracts \nelectronically.  I am sure it is possible to do that.\nIt requires some kind of predictability of response.\nIt might be predictability of the same type as Mark describes on ws-\narch for getting reliable coordination without reliable messaging.\n\n&gt; I thought the only (minor) slip in your description of the POST \nwhere a sub-resource is\n&gt; created is that you say the client can *request* creation (or \nexpect creation).  You can expect\n&gt; whatever you want, but as I said there&#39;s no contract*.  And you&#39;re \nnot really requesting that\n&gt; a resource be created.  You&#39;re trusting the wizard (behind the \nresource curtain) to do the right\n&gt; thing.\n\nI want a contract.  I don&#39;t need to start with a contract.\nI expect some kind of predictability to emerge from conversation.\nI think it will involve stereotyped conversational patterns.\nI think they can be described via RDF or XML.\n\n&gt; * I guess you could negotiate a contract like this, but what I \nmeant is that it&#39;s not REST\n&gt; or HTTP baseline stuff.\n\nI expect it will require something like an RDF contract for \nconversational behavior, which could also be a REST resource.\n\n&gt; PS - thanks for trying to understand my esoteric ramblings, and \nyes, every bit does help.\n\nI appreciate your ramblings because I sense that you are another \nperson who is honestly trying to get it.  If we can help each other, \nI&#39;m happy.  If we just confuse each other more, well, par for the \ncourse I guess, and we&#39;ll get over it.\n\n-Bob\n\n\n\nYahoo!

forth, but there can be no such thing as &quot;knowing a resource is \n  &lt;BR&gt;this type or that&quot;, &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I thought that&#39;s what RDF was for.&lt;BR&gt;I also \n  wonder if anybody has bent HTTP Header content-type in this \n  &lt;BR&gt;direction?&nbsp; (Can&#39;t get to Mark&#39;s articles right now to see if he \n  &lt;BR&gt;mentioned this possibility. I think I remember somebody doing so in a \n  &lt;BR&gt;previous message in this list, but can&#39;t find that, either.)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  because&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the resource is free to handle POST as it sees fit.&nbsp; In \n  other &lt;BR&gt;words, &quot;IdentityPreservingResource&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; may be what it&#39;s doing \n  sometimes, but it&#39;s not a contract with &lt;BR&gt;you.&nbsp; At least that&#39;s \n  the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; understanding I&#39;ve come away with.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I want to be able to \n  negotiate legally binding contracts &lt;BR&gt;electronically.&nbsp; I am sure it is \n  possible to do that.&lt;BR&gt;It requires some kind of predictability of \n  response.&lt;BR&gt;It might be predictability of the same type as Mark describes on \n  ws-&lt;BR&gt;arch for getting reliable coordination without reliable \n  messaging.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I thought the only (minor) slip in your description of \n  the POST &lt;BR&gt;where a sub-resource is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; created is that you say the \n  client can *request* creation (or &lt;BR&gt;expect creation).&nbsp; You can \n  expect&lt;BR&gt;&gt; whatever you want, but as I said there&#39;s no contract*.&nbsp; \n  And you&#39;re &lt;BR&gt;not really requesting that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; a resource be created.&nbsp; \n  You&#39;re trusting the wizard (behind the &lt;BR&gt;resource curtain) to do the \n  right&lt;BR&gt;&gt; thing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I want a contract.&nbsp; I don&#39;t need to start \n  with a contract.&lt;BR&gt;I expect some kind of predictability to emerge from \n  conversation.&lt;BR&gt;I think it will involve stereotyped conversational \n  patterns.&lt;BR&gt;I think they can be described via RDF or XML.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; * I \n  guess you could negotiate a contract like this, but what I &lt;BR&gt;meant is that \n  it&#39;s not REST&lt;BR&gt;&gt; or HTTP baseline stuff.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I expect it will require \n  something like an RDF contract for &lt;BR&gt;conversational behavior, which could \n  also be a REST resource.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; PS - thanks for trying to understand my \n  esoteric ramblings, and &lt;BR&gt;yes, every bit does help.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I appreciate your \n  ramblings because I sense that you are another &lt;BR&gt;person who is honestly \n  trying to get it.&nbsp; If we can help each other, &lt;BR&gt;I&#39;m happy.&nbsp; If we \n  just confuse each other more, well, par for the &lt;BR&gt;course I guess, and we&#39;ll \n  get over it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;-Bob&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/TT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;TT&gt;To \n  unsubscribe from this group, send an email \n  to:&lt;BR&gt;rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/TT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;TT&gt;Your \n  use of Yahoo!
