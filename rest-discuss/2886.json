It also might hurt the ability to do\n&gt; streaming responses if the metadata affects the processing of the streaming\n&gt; data.\n\nPossible.  But I&#39;m more concerned with implementation complexity, both\nof a library, and of applications using the library.  Not all of the\ncomplexity can be isolated from the app.\n\nAre there enough application protocol library developer gurus around\nthat would know how to build such a library?  I&#39;d guess there would be\nan order of magnitude less people qualified to build such a beast.\nWould that hurt Waka&#39;s chance of success?  I think it could, even if\nRoy does lead a libwww-waka project.\n\nKnowing Roy, I&#39;m sure he&#39;s considered all this.  Either he feels that\nthe pros will outweigh the cons, or he&#39;s got something in mind for to\naddress the cons.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.
