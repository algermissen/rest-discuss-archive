Should one\n&gt; discourage people to create cool URIs\n&gt; (http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI) with the result that they are\n&gt; more likely not to hard-code / deep-link them?\n\nThere is nothing unRESTful about deep-linking.  URIs are how you\nidentify resources in a REST/HTTP system.  It is perfectly reasonable\nfor clients want/need to store references so some resources.  A\nclients that does so needs to understand redirections when\ndereferencing stored URIs, though.\n\n&gt; It somehow feels better to encourage people to create cool URIs,\n&gt; with the benefit that if clients hard-code / deep-link the URIs, the\n&gt; URIs are less likely to change (because of their &quot;coolness&quot;) and\n&gt; hence they are in a sense more loosely coupled. But of course, this\n&gt; may result in people never learning HATEOAS as some of you have\n&gt; pointed out.\n\nURI construction is something that should be avoided for all the\nreasons already mentioned in this thread.  However, giving up &quot;cool\nURIs&quot; as a way to reduce the possibility of URI construction would be\na very unfortunate choice.\n\n--\nPeter Williams\nhttp://barelyenough.org\n\n"}}
