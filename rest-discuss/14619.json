Following all REST-re=\r\nlated development on the WWW is somewhat a hassle since there&#39;s a lot to fo=\r\nllow: this discussion group, a lot of blogs covering both REST and non-REST=\r\n stuff and a lot of other pages (projects, frameworks, news articles, scien=\r\ntific papers...) which are hard to search for since &quot;REST&quot; is not a very go=\r\nod query. \n\nWhat I&#39;d like is a brief overview of only and all things REST t=\r\nhat happened in the last week and to be able to receive that overview throu=\r\ngh my feed reader. A blog feels right for delivery, but raises the question=\r\n of who would maintain it and how. A collaborative approach where everyone =\r\nwould send links to a single person which would compile the blog post would=\r\n work. An alternative would be creating a wiki page for collaborative link =\r\ngathering, but leaves the question of how the overview would be delivered o=\r\nn a weekly basis. Another alternative would be to use this group for both g=\r\nathering links (as replies to a single request-for-links weekly post) and p=\r\nublishing the weekly overview (as a new weekly post).\n\nAnyway, what do you =\r\nthink? \n\nCheers,\nIvan\n\n\n"}}
