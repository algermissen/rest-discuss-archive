No need to learn a new media type.\n\n4) You can do content/capabilties negotionation using the &quot;profile&quot; \nparameter of the mediatype. For instance &quot;Accept: \napplication/xhtml+xml;profile=e-procurement&quot;. See section 8 of \nhttp://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3236.txt This should be equivalent to \napplication/e-procurement+xml albeit with XHTML instead of XML.\n\nThe downside is:\n\n1) It cannot do everything - like for instance telling the client to use \nPUT/DELETE in forms or use URL templates. So it *does* have a more \nrestricted set of capabilities than a custom made media type.\n\n2) The client must look into the returned XHTML for something similar to the \nprofile parameter (for instance the doctype). As per \nhttp://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3236.txt it says &quot;It is intended to be used only \nduring content negotiation. It is not expected that it be used to deliver \ncontent&quot;. So it requires a bit of tunneling as you call it.\n\n3) Visibility: the API documentation may be visible but the capabilities are \nnot visible in the returned data (see above).\n\n4) Well known media type: yes, it is well known, but my client still needs \nto learn how to extract the M2M payload embedded in the HTML. So I don&#39;t \ngain that much from this.\n\nHopefully I didn&#39;t get the original arguments completely wrong.\n\nSo there is a lot that can be done with existing media types like XHTML (and \nRDF). Personally I like the benefits you get in terms of a self documenting \nAPI with HTML directly embedded in it. On the flip-side I really dislike the \ntunneling aspect of it.\n\nBut if I want documentation directly in the API I could as well use link \nheaders to embed links to the API documentation - it would although be a bit \nhidden. I have also had success with providing an XSLT link in the XML such \nthat browsers will render the raw XML as nicely formated HTML. All in all \nspeaking in favor of new media types.\n\n/J�rn\n\n[1] http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/18126 : &quot;each \ntime a dev spits out custom XML or JSON serializations of internal objects, \na &quot;new media type&quot; is born (and i think someone kicks a cat, too)&quot;.\n\n\n"}}
