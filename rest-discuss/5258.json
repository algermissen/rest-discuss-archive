It&#39;s a protocol for apps that transfer hypertext messages\naround. TCP is a transport. The Soap/WS-* folks, too, finally recognize that\ndistinction.  \n\n&gt; While I understand that REST is an\n&gt; Architectural Style, and not a specific implementation, it maps well\n&gt; to the GET/PUT, etc. of the HTTP headers, and most people seem to\n&gt; leave it at that.\n&gt; \n&gt; Are the two inextricably tied?  Have people built real applications\n&gt; using different, e.g. MQ or other MOM type async transports, than\n&gt; HTTP?\n&gt; \n\n[hvw] Roy Fielding reverse-engineered the way the web worked and called that\nthe REST style. You could design other RESTful systems using MOMs. You&#39;d\nbuild in these characteristics\n\no You&#39;d pass around hypertext documents that maintain the application state.\no These documents would be the representations of some resources you could\nidentify by some identifier ( ideally, URI)\no The message processor would have a pretty limited number of verbs (could\nhave just &quot;process this&quot;). The verbs don&#39;t have to be limited to just the\nfab four, either.\n\n\nBut yeah, web apps are the archetypal REST apps, so that&#39;s where most of the\ndiscussion lies. \n\n\nHugh\n\n\n\n\n"}}
