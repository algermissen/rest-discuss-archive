I did not make the list to diminish people,=\r\n but to point to uses or understandings or REST that I think are not totall=\r\ny correct. Since I&#39;m not in the last group, it may be that one, several or =\r\npartially some of the categories are right. \n\nReading it again, yes, it sou=\r\nnds humorous! Probably because I tend to write that way (look at some other=\r\ns posts I have). But I assure you that it was not my intention to make ridi=\r\nculous observations of people to make fun of them. No sense. \n\nLet me take =\r\nsome of the phrases you pointed out:\n&quot;They like buzz words, so they follow =\r\nREST just because it is cool and all people talk about it.&quot; This is BuzzWor=\r\nders. Let me tell you there is an antipattern called &quot;Jumping the Bandwagon=\r\n&quot;. It refers to people and organizations that follow buzzwords just because=\r\n they are buzzwords. Thousands of companies bought tools and platforms to h=\r\nave SOA in their systems. It is hard to find a tool that does not offer som=\r\ne kind of REST solution. And it is hard to find a company now that is not t=\r\nhinking on adding a REST API to their offerings. For some reason Roy explod=\r\ned last time someone was marketing their new &quot;RESTFul API&quot;. REST should be =\r\nfollowed if it makes sense in your system. Is it suddenly that all systems =\r\nin the world are networked systems on the web that need REST? See the point=\r\n? Humorous or diminishings of a particular person?\n\nNow, &quot;someone told them=\r\n REST is a way to do services without SOAP. So they follow...&quot;. What can I =\r\nmention about this one? Look for all the discussion on the web, thousands o=\r\nf them, where the two antagonistic sides are WS (SOAP) and REST. As if REST=\r\n was actually a replacement for web services. And Web Services was another =\r\nBuzzWord (I had clients asking to add WS where they didn&#39;t fit, simply beca=\r\nuse they wanted WS!). \n\n&quot;someone told them REST is easy, so they follow doi=\r\nng easy things with URIs&quot;, &quot;so they follow REST doing whatever they want.&quot;.=\r\n REST is not easy, if it is then why are there so many questions in this fo=\r\nrum? Hundreds of APIs were not more than RPC composed in URIs (did they rea=\r\nd anything to keep them away of doing the most dreaded RPC? If so why do th=\r\ney keep doing it?). Clients ask me to do it REST because it would be easier=\r\n that web services. And WS are a right away. \n\n&quot;They believe REST is HTTP. =\r\nDeep enough.&quot; Actually, deep enough. I had just read one post here trying R=\r\nEST without HTTP. I&#39;m not sure if all the rest of the world knows that is p=\r\nossible. Pleas tell me what is humorous about this one.\n\n&quot;They think REST i=\r\ns a web api for CRUD. Simple.&quot;. Please search google for CRUD and REST disc=\r\nussions. And these are very interesting indeed, for the mapping is quite cl=\r\nose, and Roy may come and tell me that is ok to think of a CRUDable REST. \n=\r\n\nSo, can you see now that what you think of my intention may be correct, bu=\r\nt not quite? At least I made you think about the option, think of some of t=\r\nhem as not correct, analyze yourself to see how you fit it, and maybe make =\r\nyou aware of what things not to approach. If it helps, good. If you think I=\r\n mock up people, then I&#39;m sorry.\n\nWilliam Martinez Pomares.\n\n\n--- In rest-d=\r\niscuss@yahoogroups.com, Ant=F3nio Mota &lt;amsmota@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I though yo=\r\nur initial post was something like a &quot;humorous&quot; post, that \n&gt; the intention=\r\n of it was to put a smile in everybody faces.

But now you \n&gt; say tha=\r\nt this is not a &quot;humorous&quot; post but it should be taken literally, \n&gt; becaus=\r\ne &quot;the intention is to identify how is the REST term used and \n&gt; understood=\r\n.&quot; And we have to identify ourselves in one of the groups you \n&gt; mention, m=\r\nost of them &quot;because it&#39;s cool&quot;, because &quot;someone told then&quot; \n&gt; and &quot;so the=\r\ny follow&quot;, practically all of them described in terms that \n&gt; are either hu=\r\nmorous or (xor) diminishing...\n&gt; \n&gt; I myself think I can fall in more than =\r\none group, but I prefer to think \n&gt; that is because I&#39;m in a early stage of=\r\n working with REST and I have \n&gt; lot&#39;s of things yet to grasp and little ti=\r\nme to do it, and not just \n&gt; because I found REST cool and all people talk =\r\nabout it., or because \n&gt; someone told me something and I just follow, or be=\r\ncause I&#39;m shallow \n&gt; enough to believe REST is HTTP, or naive enough to thi=\r\nnk is simple \n&gt; CRUD... That would be to dismiss a person as of little inte=\r\nlligence, not \n&gt; to say other harsh words...\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, do you really be=\r\nlieve there is only a person that knows REST as \n&gt; it actually is and under=\r\nstands it, being that person Roy, or is that \n&gt; part irony/humorous? Becaus=\r\ne I don&#39;t belong to that particular group for \n&gt; sure, but to some people o=\r\nn this list that wrote lot&#39;s of good articles \n&gt; in blogs from which I lear=\r\nned a lot that is, at least, unfair...\n&gt; \n&gt; Not that I think your intention=\r\n was that, of course.\n&gt; \n&gt; William Martinez Pomares wrote:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He=\r\nllo Bill.\n&gt; &gt; Not sure of your intention with the comment.

Not even sure of your idea of my idea by writing the list.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Let =\r\nme state it again:\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I love doing so sometimes (Naming things) to know w=\r\nhat am I referring to&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I guess it helps understand where are we standi=\r\nng in terms of REST \n&gt; &gt; usability and knowledge.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I had been in hu=\r\nndreds of discussions. Most of the time, two people \n&gt; &gt; discuss about diff=\r\nerent things that are named the same. So, my first \n&gt; &gt; action is to clarif=\r\ny what I mean by that name. Just as I did now with \n&gt; &gt; my idea in the line=\r\ns above.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ok, let&#39;s start again: I&#39;ve created a classification of th=\r\ne common \n&gt; &gt; understandings people that I&#39;ve read and discussed with, had =\r\nshown \n&gt; &gt; related to REST. The intention is to identify how is the REST te=\r\nrm \n&gt; &gt; used and understood. It makes no sense to put a face on each class,=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; when we want common behavior for analysis.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sorry if taken as =\r\na bad thing.

Someone suggested naming things is not so =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; good, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I love doing so somethings to know what am I referri=\r\nng to.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, having all of you as REST fans, I wanted to pres=\r\nent a \n&gt; &gt; classification\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I did two days ago while riding the bus t=\r\no work. Silly? It may be, \n&gt; &gt; but I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guess it helps understand wher=\r\ne are we standing in terms of REST\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; usability and knowledge.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *API Makers*: I find them everywhere. They have a system, usually =\r\nnot\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; built thinking on REST, and they want an API created. They usua=\r\nlly \n&gt; &gt; think\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; REST is an API making technique or recipe, for the w=\r\neb.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; /Subcategories:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; / - *URI Jugglers*. This are the ones t=\r\nhat think REST is all about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; creating URIs, and nothing more. So the=\r\nir discussions are solely \n&gt; &gt; focused\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on URIs, and their presentat=\r\nions are about URIs definitions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - *RPCers*. Bad group that think R=\r\nEST is a way to map RPC in disguise\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; using URIs in a web API. The mo=\r\nst of them don&#39;t know they speak \n&gt; &gt; RPC at all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - *Exposers*: Thi=\r\ns type is repeated below. Those are the guys that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think you need to=\r\n expose things in REST using resources. So REST \n&gt; &gt; is an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; API for =\r\nexposing things on the web.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - *CRUDers*: Another repeated group. Th=\r\ney think REST is a web api for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CRUD. Simple.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Mappe=\r\nrs*: This other category may use the API idea, but they \n&gt; &gt; actually\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; thing REST is a representation type and the work to be done is to map\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; all that is know used to that new type. Interesting?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - *CRUDe=\r\nrs*. Again, the idea is that CRUD can be mapped naturally to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; HTTP o=\r\nperations, and that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; makes it RESTful.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - *HTTPers*. They bel=\r\nieve REST is HTTP. Deep enough.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - *Exposers*. Again too. They usual=\r\nly try to map all classes, data\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; entities, elements into resources, =\r\nand then call their systems \n&gt; &gt; RESTful.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; FAD followers?*=\r\n: This is a group of t he reminders of the types.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Usually, they ten=\r\nd to follow a lead.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - *Standard Haters*: Here you have all those th=\r\nat think Standards are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evil and that REST is an anarchy where you h=\r\nave the freedom to do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whatever you like, so they follow REST doing =\r\nwhatever they want.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - *KISS lovers*. This are the ones that like th=\r\ninks to be simple. And\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; someone told them REST is easy, so they foll=\r\now doing easy things with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; URIs. There are lots of URI jugglers in t=\r\nhis group.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - *Servicers*. They think Services is good, and someone =\r\ntold them \n&gt; &gt; REST\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is a way to do services without SOAP. So they f=\r\nollow.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - *BuzzWorders*. This is a vast majority. They like buzz wor=\r\nds, so \n&gt; &gt; they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; follow REST just because it is cool and all people=\r\n talk about it. \n&gt; &gt; There\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are some Buzz creators too, with thinks =\r\nlike ROA and REST in WOA. \n&gt; &gt; No pun\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; intended on REST-*\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Is there some one I&#39;m missing? Well, yes, probably the group that \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; knows\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; REST as it actually is and understan ds it. That may be a o=\r\nne person\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; group (yes Roy).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m may not be saying al=\r\nl those believes up there are wrong. I&#39;m NOT\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; saying they are good, =\r\nat all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What do you think?
