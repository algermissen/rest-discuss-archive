I would agree that, for example, an SMTP\n&gt;&gt;message isn&#39;t visible to an HTTP intermediary.  But there&#39;s shared\n&gt;&gt;knowledge on application semantics in the HTTP/HTTP case.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;If the _whole_ content of the application and it&#39;s semantics can be \n&gt;derived from RFC 2616, then yes. HTTP semantics are visible to HTTP \n&gt;intermediaries.\n&gt;\n&gt;But as acres of earlier mail should have made clear, I don&#39;t believe \n&gt;that the semantics of Web services can be fully captured at the level \n&gt;of HTTP.\n&gt;\n&gt;Let&#39;s face it, HTTP isn&#39;t even enough for plain hypertext ... the HTML \n&gt;REC isn&#39;t an appendix of RFC 2616 ;-)\n&gt;\n&gt;Cheers,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Miles\n&gt;\n&gt;----- End forwarded message -----\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
