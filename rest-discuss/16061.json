Same goes with\n&gt; supporting mobile devices, client or server can generate some sort of\n&gt; tiny app with XSLT, in fact Xforms has come out of nowhere to start\n&gt; looking like a viable mobile markup, and I&#39;m a big fan of Xforms.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t see REST becoming less relevant as mobile proliferates or the\n&gt; Web evolves towards being more m2m. \n\nREST is useful for mobile, a couple of on the ground issues come to mind\n\n - Fat web formats consumes energy and bandwidth.\n\n - Hypertext traversal increases latency and network hops over\nconstrained radio networks (even the packet switched ones defined by\nLTE).\n\nThe former is mitigated by allowing partial data or less fat formats\n(decompression is not pue for a mobile device and there is no law far\nbattery improvement developers can free ride on). The latter is\nmitigated by allowing clients to consume a &#39;discovery&#39; document that\ndescribe the resources available and their URIs. I note that performance\nis not an explicit goal of REST, but as things stand today I would\nprefer the option of discovery than throwing out the system benefits of\nREST. Fwiw, a forms document fits in my notion of discovery.\n\nFinally push is very useful for mobile but that is outside REST&#39;s design\ngoals. I suspect there are some concepts from ARRESTED  or P2P that may\nbe useful in mobile systems.\n\nBill\n\n\n\n"}}
