It is therefore not dependent upon\n&gt;&gt; the representation. eg. if I am being shown an itinerary for my approval\n&gt;&gt; prior to a final booking, I am in the state of reviewing the itinerary -\n&gt;&gt; irrespective of whether the itinerary was being rendered as XHTML, JSON,\n&gt;&gt; XML, PDF or PNG.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure if I understand the distinction you make between application\n&gt; and resource state\n\nXHTML / JSON formats are an attribute of the resource representation - they\ncannot be an attribute of the application state, since from an application\nperspective, the user is exactly at the same place in the overall workflow\nirrespective of the resource representation.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;        b) How is a bookmark adequately defined ? This is really a\n&gt;&gt;        question for the author of a browser to answer. If we had a\n&gt;&gt;        browser which say allowed you to also describe the accept\n&gt;&gt;        headers before making the URI, then let us for a moment\n&gt;&gt;        suggest that such a browser the bookmark perhaps could contain\n&gt;&gt;        the accept header. However we don&#39;t have such browsers (I\n&gt;&gt;        haven&#39;t seen one at least). But it is likely that programmatic\n&gt;&gt;        clients may want to choose to store such URIs for say resuming\n&gt;&gt;        later. Such a browser is again unlikely to &#39;break&#39; if it is\n&gt;&gt;        able to accept and parse various content types with equal\n&gt;&gt;        capability or works with only one content type which it always\n&gt;&gt;        specifically requests. However it could break if in a\n&gt;&gt;        particular situation it has requested a particular resource\n&gt;&gt;        with a non default accept headers and that is specifically\n&gt;&gt;        needed to resume further. In such a situation, perhaps the\n&gt;&gt;        bookmark could store the accept header.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    That is, essentially, what I was suggesting\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yes, thats what I had assumed you were referring to - I was on the other\n&gt;&gt; hand attempting to separate the notion of the bookmark and the application\n&gt;&gt; state - ie. they are not one and the same.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; If a bookmark is not a stored reference to a given application state, what\n&gt; is it?\n\nIn this context it is a stored reference to an application state + a\npreferred format.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;        But even in this case the accept headers imo are not an\n&gt;&gt;        attribute of the application state - they are an application\n&gt;&gt;        of the conversation state (though I am open to be challenged\n&gt;&gt;        since I myself am not so terribly convinced about it).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    I don&#39;t know if I understand what you mean by &#39;application of the\n&gt;&gt;    conversation state&#39; - but there is no room for a state between\n&gt;&gt;    application and resource, given communication in RESTful systems\n&gt;&gt;    is (supposed to be) stateless.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, made a mistake there - should&#39;ve stated &quot; the accept headers imo\n&gt;&gt; are not an attribute of the application state - they are an _*attribute*_ of\n&gt;&gt; the conversation state&quot;. Though reading it again I feel a little lame. I\n&gt;&gt; should&#39;ve been more specific and should&#39;ve said &quot;the accept headers imo are\n&gt;&gt; not an attribute of the application state - they are merely the influencers\n&gt;&gt; of a representation as a part of a given conversation&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; If they are influencing the representation transfered, they are impacting\n&gt; on the application state. I can agree that there is no difference between\n&gt; the resource state, but that is desired behavior from negotiated\n&gt; representations of the same resource.\n\n\nI would just suggest the following hypothetical scenario. If I received a\nXHTML version of my itinerary and it had a link to obtain a PDF version, and\nthen I click it - would it mean that the I would do a state transition from\none state to another or would it be from a state to itself. I am arguing\nthat both are same states ie. the transition is back to the same state, from\nwhat I presume you&#39;ve been stating the user does a state transition to a\ndifferent state. If I am correct in that assessment, then we differ in the\nessential understanding of application state and may have work to do to\nfigure out which is the more appropriate interpretation.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; - Mike\n&gt;\n\nDhananjay\n\r\n--000e0cd1e7e659517a046facf3ec\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nMike,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Mon, Jul 27, 2009 at 3:15 PM, Mi=\r\nke Kelly &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:mike@...&quot;&gt;mike@m=\r\nykanjo.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex;=\r\n padding-left: 1ex;&quot;&gt;\nDhananjay Nene wrote:&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;blockquo=\r\nte class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204)=\r\n; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOn Mon, Jul 27,=\r\n 2009 at 2:29 PM, Mike Kelly &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:mike@...&quot; targ=\r\net=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mike@...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;mailto:&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:mike@myka=\r\nnjo.co.uk&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mike@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0Hi Dhananjay,&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0Why would application state a=\r\nlways be the same for all&lt;br&gt;\n =A0 =A0representations of a resource?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAn application state reflects where the user is in the overall work=\r\nflow supported / managed by the application.
