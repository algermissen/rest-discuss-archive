Their  \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; purpose is\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; discovered by inspection.  Of course, there are expectations when\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; following a link and breaking these may cause confusion in the user\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; agent even for humnas (for example, following a &quot;pay now&quot; link and\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; arriving at a recipe for chocolate cake).  Furthermore, encoding  \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nature of the document in the content type, means that this\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; information will be out-of-band, which may cause other  \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; complications.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; That is a misinterpretation.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, but can you clarify if you simply don&#39;t agree with my  \n&gt;&gt; interpretation or if you *know* that my interpretation is wrong?\n&gt;\n&gt; See RFC 2616#7.1 and 14.17. Entity headers like Content-Type provide  \n&gt; metadata about the entity. What a given media type means is  \n&gt; something clients and servers learn out of band. This is true for  \n&gt; existing IANA media types as well as new media types.\n\nYes, and that&#39;s not a good thing.  It means that user agents,  \nintermediaries, and servers must be revved simultaneously.  The cost  \nof &quot;educating&quot; end-points is so enormous that it should only be done  \nas a collective effort (I did a post on this some weeks ago showing  \nthe information theoretical justification for this).  It also means  \nthat there is no graceful degradation since either a MIME type is  \nknown or it&#39;s not.  And it doesn&#39;t set the stage for serendipitous  \nengineering, imo.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; The moment you start overloading media types, that visibility  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; would be gone. Also note that this is a problem with any payload  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; format, including Atom.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Would the web really have scaled as well as it did if we had &quot;text/ \n&gt;&gt; login+html&quot;, &quot;text/checkout+html&quot; instead of only &quot;text/html&quot;?   \n&gt;&gt; What if a page allows both operations, does it become &quot;text/login \n&gt;&gt; +checkout+html&quot;?  I&#39;m a bit wary about manifesting the intent at  \n&gt;&gt; that level.\n&gt;\n&gt; The answer is simple. Are clients required to apply special  \n&gt; processing rules to any of these?\n\nMaybe yes, maybe no... that&#39;s the point.  A server cannot and should  \ntry to anticipate everything the client wants to do.  Instead, it  \nshould package up the information into a &quot;document&quot; that is self- \ndescriptive and not application specific (i.e. application/xhtml+xml  \nvs. application/vnd.xyz+xml).\n\n&gt; IMO, there is no binary answer to the question of whether you should  \n&gt; always use some well-known media type or not. Either approach could  \n&gt; bite back if not well-thought out. There were instances where some  \n&gt; format-designers &quot;forgot&quot; to assign media types and created mess.  \n&gt; Apart from visibility, consider interoperability and compatibility.\n\n\nFirst off, let me make clear that I&#39;m discussing this to learn.  I&#39;m  \nproponent, not a zealot. So I appreciate your point of view, even if I  \nprobe its reasons.  :)\n\nTo provide context: the API for our wiki application relies heavily  \ntoday on custom XML types.  It has its benefits (time to market).  But  \nalso cost (time to educate).  However, ever since I started digging my  \nteeth into WOA, I&#39;ve been putting on a &quot;what-if&quot; hat.  For instance,  \nwhat if one were to rely on semantic annotations of HTML instead of  \ncustom XML types?  What if a user agent had to interpret a submit form  \ninstead of solely relying on built-in knowledge?\n\nPreliminary experimentation with using XHTML as standard MIME type for  \nweb-services has been quite positive, but I haven&#39;t applied to a  \nproduct yet.  And I know from my write up about the cost of custom  \nMIME types, that using this approach is awfully expensive in the grand  \nscheme of things.  Hence, using established hypermedia formats should  \nbe preferred.  However, since cost is bound by the total population of  \nuser agents which need to know about it, it&#39;s negligible for private,  \nin-house, custom made applications.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I agree with you that the answer varies, but I  \nbelieve the outcome is not driven by the application, but its reach  \n(which you may have alluded to already by stating interoperability and  \ncompatibility).  The more user agents there are interacting with your  \nAPI, the more driven you should be to fit it into an established MIME  \ntype.\n\n- Steve\n\n--------------\nSteve G.
