Specifically, my web\n&gt; service &quot;accepts&quot; resources (its job is to collect information). Thus, a\n&gt; client POSTs a resource to my web service.  How would a client know what\n&gt; resource format my web service will accept?\n&gt; \n\n\n&gt; Note that I am concerned here with Machine-to-Machine processing (not\n&gt; Human-to-Machine processing).  Let&#39;s suppose that my web service accepts\n&gt; resources in the form of XML documents.\n&gt; \n&gt; Client --------------&gt; Web Service\n&gt;            POST\n&gt;          XML-payload\n&gt; \n&gt; How would a client Machine know the format of the XML document that should\n&gt; be sent to my web service?\n&gt; \n&gt; Client: &quot;what do I sent to the web service???&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Must the client Machine be preprogrammed to know the correct format?\n&gt; (Clearly, this is not extensible.)  Is there a RESTful way for clients to\n&gt; dynamically discover the correct format?  /Roger\n&gt; \n\n[hvw] By analogy to web browsers and HTML: In the human-to-machine case,\nnobody ever POSTS out of thin air. You POST based on information you\npreviously received in an HTML form. Mark Baker proposed RDF Forms\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca/2003/05/RDF-Forms/ and that is one way you could\npromote similar discovery in machine-to-machine processing. The RDF form\ntells the invoker the media type(s) to POST.\n\nHugh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
