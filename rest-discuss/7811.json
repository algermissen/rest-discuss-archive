The more complex behaviour of the trainer  \nmight even be =\r\npretty much predictable when one knows the exact  \nalgorithm hidden here, b=\r\nut at the same time might appear to be  \ncompletely random to a user lookin=\r\ng from the outside. As far as I  \nunderstand REST deals with what is visibl=\r\ne from the outside.\n\n&gt; That means that the list of what has been\n&gt; complete=\r\nd has to be included explicitly or implicitly in the url.\n&gt;\n&gt; Explicitly (c=\r\nlient keeps track of which are completed):\n&gt; http://example.com/thetrainer?=\r\ncompleted=3D1+2+3+4\n&gt;\n&gt; Implicitly (server keeps track of which are complet=\r\ned):\n&gt; http://example.com/thetrainer?student=3Dfoo\n&gt; (add authentication de=\r\ntails here?)\n&gt;\n&gt; In the client-side case you would likely need to be rewrit=\r\ning hrefs in\n&gt; pages your return to the student to include the list of comp=\r\nleted  \n&gt; items.\n&gt; In the server-side case you would likely need the client=\r\n to PUT or  \n&gt; POST\n&gt; information about completed courses, possibly in the =\r\nform of completed\n&gt; exam papers for example.\n\nYes, absolutely.\n\nI&#39;ve starte=\r\nd implementing this having the server keeping track of the  \nstate.\n\n-- \nsv=\r\nen fuchs\t\t\tfon:  +49 (58 45) 98 89 58\nartweb design\t\t\tfax:  +49 (58 45) 98 =\r\n89 57\nbreite stra=DFe 65\t\twww: http://www.artweb-design.de\nde-29468 bergen\t=\r\n\tmail: svenfuchs@...\n\n\n\n"}}
