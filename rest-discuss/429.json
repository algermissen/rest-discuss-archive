Send me email\n&gt; &gt; (or an HTTP call, or a .NET Alert?) when any page in such and such a\n&gt; &gt; wiki changes.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s a good idea. Our radical idea is that for applications that do\n&gt; not already have a client UI, you could just use HTTP itself for the\n&gt; events. But a bridge to SMTP and .NET alert makes sense for legacy\n&gt; reasons.\n\nI understand that.  But I believe that radical ideas don&#39;t amount to a\nhill of beans in this world of ours without prototypes, rough drafts and\nworking code =).\n\nOne of the software efforts I was involved with involved radical ideas\nclashing against legacy systems.  While working for Brown University&#39;s\nIT department, we had a &#39;grand vision&#39; of a campus wide PKI focused\naround Kerberos (not sure why -- I think it mostly had to do with legal\nliability concerns).  What it boiled down to on a daily basis was adding\nKerberos support to NNTP, SMTP, Gopher and other clients. We were\nsupposed to add this support to all the widely used &quot;open source&quot; (this\nis before the term =) clients on campus.\n\nT&#39;was hell, and it was a failure.  Kerberos logins ended up being used\nonly for manipulating contact info in the central database through\nspecial-purpose clients, but we never could get enough clients\nconverted, and the world wasn&#39;t standing still.\n\nMoral of that story?  Not sure yet -- I&#39;m still ramping up on REST and\nHTTP events =).\n\n--david\n\nPS: Possibly silly question -- HTTP is allowed through firewalls over\nport 80 in many organizations, which is why it&#39;s a good idea for things\nlike WebDAV.  However, many of the applications for HTTP Events that I\ncan think of are _personal_, and in the radical vision I&#39;d expect my\npersonal computer to have several apps listening to and sending HTTP\nevents.  How do you envision port allocations to work?  Would I run a\n&quot;main event dispatcher&quot; on my port 80, and the apps would register with\nit?  Put concisely, how do you deal with the &quot;Port 80 already in use&quot;\nproblem?\n\n"}}
