Good point. I&#39;d like to avoid new methods if I can, just on \n&gt; principle.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; More than just good principle: best practise. New HTTP methods dont go\n&gt; through firewalls, and arent supported by all the various http client\n\nThat&#39;s not my experience. Any examples?\n\n&gt; libs out there. In particular, if javascript in IE/firefox/webkit\n&gt; doesnt support the method, it aint going to be used in AJAX land.\n\nIE6 and Firefox support arbitrary methods. The fact that XHR in IE7 \ndoesn&#39;t (right now) has been reported (and I think accepted) as a \nregression.\n\n&gt; If someone were to start a REST design patterns doc, &quot;inventing new\n&gt; verbs&quot; would be the antipattern, one that has just surfaced again in\n&gt; Web3S.\n\nI strongly disagree.\n\n&gt; I know that its &quot;PATCH&quot; may have appeal, but once you try and have a\n&gt; complete sequence of operations in a single verb, you have to worry\n&gt; about whether the sequence is atomic, what its rollback on failure\n&gt; mode is, whether it is partially visible, etc. WS-RF&#39;s bulk get/set\n\nYes. That&#39;s a feature, not a problem.\n\n&gt; had this problem: they didnt spec the atomicity/isolation so you have\n&gt; no way of knowing if you are doing atomic or non atomic ops. Whereas\n&gt; if you have to make a set of operations, well, your expectations are\n&gt; set nice and low.\n\nI do agree that promising too much atomicity can be a problem. But that \nonly means you need to be careful when defining the method. For \ninstance, I don&#39;t see how requiring a PATCH operation to be atomic would \nbe a problem. If all goes wrong, a server still return 5xx.\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n\n"}}
