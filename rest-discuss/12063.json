Is the client required to understand  \nthat it needs to pass &quot;/view&quot; in the URI to &quot;view&quot; this document, and,  \nperhaps, add &quot;/edit&quot; in the URI to &quot;edit&quot; this document? If so, that  \nis not RESTful as it violates the uniform interface. If, on the  \notherhand, the server is providing URIs for these actions within the  \nhypermedia, that will then drive the client to use GET and POST/PUT to  \ndo these actions, then it may not be violating the uniform interface.\n\nTo be more specific, the HTML might contain a link to &quot;/edit? \ndocid=...&quot;, a GET to which would render a HTML page with a form, and  \nform submission would do a POST to &quot;/edit?docid=...&quot;. Some may argue  \nthat this is incorrect (since the URIs to get and edit the resource  \nare not the same), but that is where we are with HTML.\n\nSubbu\n\nOn Feb 2, 2009, at 8:32 AM, Ramamoorthy Subramanian wrote:\n\n&gt; OpenSocial REST API - http://docs.google.com/View?docid=dcc2jvzt_37hdzwkmf8\n&gt;\n&gt; If I understand it right, the above URL is not RESTful as it&#39;s not  \n&gt; denoting a resource rather an action (view).

After all, HTTP is really the RESTful protocol being used, so  \n&gt;&gt; the verbs\n&gt;&gt; are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., and even though the URL has verbs  \n&gt;&gt; in it,\n&gt;&gt; it&#39;s still just the address for the resource, right?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I can, however, see the argument against verbs in the URL (I  \n&gt;&gt; think), since\n&gt;&gt; the implication is that the URLs then become the API to the  \n&gt;&gt; application,\n&gt;&gt; causing a diversity of actions, rather than a diversity of  \n&gt;&gt; resources. Is\n&gt;&gt; this the main argument against using verbs in the URL?\n&gt;\n&gt; Yep. If your URLs describe a suite of actions, with parameters in the\n&gt; query string, then you&#39;re just building a RPC application. You&#39;re\n&gt; defining a custom interface for making your app do things, rather than\n&gt; sticking to the uniform interface defined by HTTP.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; -Ben\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n---\nhttp://subbu.org\n\n\n"}}
