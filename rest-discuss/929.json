The answer is that, if both mechanisms were equally expressive, we\nwouldn&#39;t need both.  But the fact is that navigation and naming aren&#39;t equally expressive in all\nsituations or for all purposes.  There are things you can do --- particularly in dense,\nhighly-structured information spaces --- which are not possible via traversal of graph structures from\nopaque entry points.\n\nImagine if, whenever I wanted to run &quot;ls&quot; for the first time in a shell process, I had to &quot;crawl&quot; the\ndirectory structure from the root in order to locate the executable.  This would be awful, wouldn&#39;t it?\n\nI&#39;ve provided many examples of how generative naming can be and is used in various contexts to\naccomplish things that aren&#39;t or are not easily accomplished via navigation from some well-known\nstarting point.  To recap some of these examples:\n\n  * discovery of &quot;unlinked&quot; but named objects in a namespace\n  * creation, maintenance, and access of dense, regular namespaces\n    * logging\n    * archiving\n    * collections of non-hypermedia\n  * avoiding user interface navigation\n  * programatic use of regular namespaces\n    * log managers\n    * debuggers -w- /proc\n    * system management tools\n    * location of executables, libraries, etc. by other programs\n\nEtc. etc. etc.  All of these things benefit from having a priori understanding (via filesystem\norganization &quot;standards,&quot; conventions, grammars or rules for generating names, etc.)  of namespace\norganization and rules for generating names of interest.  All of them operate by de novo synthesis of\nsemantically-meaningful names in structured namespaces.  None of these operate solely by traversal of\ngraph structures, even trivial graph structures such as single-rooted filesystem DAGs --- and many (such\nas the debugger example) *require* structured name generation.\n\nThe value of generative naming and structured namespaces simply can&#39;t be questioned, given the ubiquity\nof the technique in everything we do with software.  It&#39;s preference to navigation *for certain\npurposes* should be clear.  Insistence otherwise is, really, pretty silly.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
