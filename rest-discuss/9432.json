It looks like you&#39;re referring to the XSS\n&gt; attacks on JSON that resulted in information disclosure... of course,\n&gt; these were services that were &quot;secured&quot; by cookies.\n\nXSS is only one problem. There&#39;s a much more fundamental one with \nevaling JSON as JavaScript. Shipping executable code around and then \nevaluating it without security checks is dangerous. Again, the Google \nsearch I recommended will lead you to plenty of deatils on these attacks \nif you&#39;re interested.\n\n&gt; The possibility of executing JSON with a script tag does make some\n&gt; attacks easier, but it doesn&#39;t make anything new possible. There are a\n&gt; variety of technologies available that will preserve confidentiality\n&gt; and prevent replay attacks. The payload format doesn&#39;t matter that\n&gt; much.\n\nHowever the parser matters a great deal. Of course you can use a real \nparser on JSON, but many programs don&#39;t. That JSON can be and is treated \nas executable code is a major flaw in its design, one XML doesn&#39;t share. \nJSON, by design, encourages poor security and a variety of attacks.\n\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
