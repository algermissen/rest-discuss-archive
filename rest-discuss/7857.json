The question is are the REST community (us) and \n&gt; software designers who are prepared to work under the REST style &quot;ready \n&gt; for success&quot;? I&#39;d say no.\n\nHey. I&#39;m a smug lisp weenie.\n\n\n&gt; &quot;Where are the REST toolkits&quot; is one of my favorite quotes of the last \n&gt; few years, partially because it&#39;s so right and so wrong. Perhaps it is \n&gt; the wrong way to think about things, but you could *never* persuade me \n&gt; that there is adequate technical support for building in the REST style \n&gt; today. Most frameworks are RPC/Gateway driven which results in bad hard \n&gt; to maintain web software - you develop in the REST style on most popular \n&gt; frameworks and you&#39;ll ship late. That&#39;s without even getting into arcana \n&gt; like rolling your own etags and figuring out where to leave them.\n\nCertainly there are better HTTP toolkits that need to be written.\n\nI was doing some openid hacking the other day with python&#39;s urllib2 -\nsupposedly quite a modern HTTP tool. Frankly I&#39;d rather have slammed\nmy fingers in a door. It was a deeply unpleasant experience.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
