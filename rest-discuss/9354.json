The 2nd DELETE should be\n&gt; &gt; directed to said trashcan and the file could then be\n&gt; &gt; completely purged (204). Explicitely DELETING the same\n&gt; &gt; resource twice is counter-intuitive and IMO breaks\n&gt; &gt; idempotence.\n&gt; \n&gt; I make the same objection to giving DELETE the semantics of\n&gt; &quot;move&quot; by having subsequent GET requests respond with a\n&gt; redirect, as I make for using PUT to implement &quot;remove&quot;\n&gt; semantics.\n\nYou are not supposed to return a redirect on subsequent GET, only\nin response to DELETE.\n\n&gt; To clarify, I am not implementing a trashcan. I am implementing\n&gt; a method whereby users of the service can toggle an URL between\n&gt; &quot;used to exist&quot; and &quot;not known to have existed&quot; and I have done\n&gt; so with an absolute minimum of complexity.\n\nThat’s fine. You don’t have to have a trashcan. You just have to\nexpose the deletedness of a resource as a separate resource.\n\n    &gt; GET /foo/bar\n    &lt; 200 OK\n\n    &gt; DELETE /foo/bar\n    &lt; 301 Moved Permanently\n    &lt; Location: /deleted/foo/bar\n\n    &gt; GET /foo/bar\n    &lt; 410 Gone\n\n    &gt; DELETE /foo/bar\n    &lt; 301 Moved Permanently\n    &lt; Location: /deleted/foo/bar\n\n    &gt; DELETE /deleted/foo/bar\n    &lt; 204 No Content\n\n    &gt; GET /foo/bar\n    &lt; 404 Not Found\n\nNote how DELETEs to either resource are effortlessly idempotent\nin this protocol design, with no concurrency issues. This is\nclearly even less complex than what you have now.\n\nIt also doesn’t require DELETEs to 4xx resources, which feels\nvery strange from an interface uniformity point of view anyway.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
