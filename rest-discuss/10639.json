As I \n&gt; understand the comments, the problem is not the use of PUT to make a \n&gt; copy per se, merely the use of an HTTP header to provide the URL for \n&gt; source of the copy instead of using an &quot;enclosed entity&quot; (as RFC 2616 \n&gt; calls it) containing the URL for the source of the copy.\n&gt; \n&gt; What threw me off a bit was Julian&#39;s question about why Amazon didn&#39;t \n&gt; use COPY or POST. As I understand it, simply substituting POST for PUT \n&gt; in the example I posted earlier in the thread wouldn&#39;t really solve the \n&gt; problem since POST, like PUT, requires that an enclosed entity be used \n&gt; -- not an HTTP header.\n&gt; ...\n\nWell, I didn&#39;t recommend using the *same* message with POST. What I \ntried to say is that Amazon is inventing something new that will only \nwork with clients written for that service, so it seems strange using \nPUT for it (which has well-defined semantics that IMHO aren&#39;t compatible \nwith what they&#39;re doing).\n\nThe right thing to do would be to use COPY which seems to do *exactly* \nwhat they want.\n\n&gt; Specifically, the section on PUT (9.6) says: &quot;The PUT method requests \n&gt; that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI.&quot; \n&gt; While the section on POST (9.5) says: &quot;The POST method is used to \n&gt; request that the origin server accept the entity enclosed in the request \n&gt; as a new subordinate of the resource identified by the Request-URI in \n&gt; the Request-Line.&quot;\n\nThat&#39;s RFC2616. In practice, POST nowadays is used for *anything* that \ndoesn&#39;t fit anywhere else, and the description in RFC2616bis has been \nadjusted accordingly:\n\n&quot;The POST method is used to request that the origin server accept the \nentity enclosed in the request as data to be processed by the resource \nidentified by the Request-URI in the Request-Line.&quot; -- \n&lt;http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics-02.html#rfc.section.8.5&gt;\n\n&gt; So this leads me to a follow up question: Using just GPPD (not COPY), \n&gt; what would be the most restful way of implementing a COPY operation? \n&gt; Would it simply be, as Jon Hanna suggested, to provide an app specific \n&gt; minimal XML wrapper around the source URL as the &quot;enclosed entity&quot;?\n\nI don&#39;t see how COPY is not &quot;restful&quot;. Could you explain?\n\nYes, it doesn&#39;t use representations to transfer state, but that&#39;s mainly \nbecause the whole point of copying things within a server is that the \nclient does not need to download and then re-upload the contents.\n\nBR, Julian\n\n"}}
