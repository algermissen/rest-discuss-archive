Bowman wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I think DELETE often gets overlooked as being self-explanatory. But it\n&gt; doesn&#39;t have to be the same as &#39;rm&#39;. Let&#39;s say I have a resource:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://example. org/foo.html &lt;http://example.org/foo.html&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; My implementation of GET responds 200 OK with a representation of foo.html,\n&gt; unless foo.html is zero bytes, in which case the response is 410 Gone.\n&gt; \n&gt; My implementation of DELETE will respond 200 OK with the string:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Set to 410 Gone, DELETE again to remove.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; After setting foo.html to zero bytes, unless foo.html already was zero\n&gt; bytes, in which case foo.html really is deleted. This second DELETE will\n&gt; respond 204 No Content, subsequent GET requests will be 404 not 410.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Eric\n\nHm.\n\nI don&#39;t think this is how 404 and 410 are meant to work. From \n&lt;http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2616.html#rfc.section.10.4.5&gt;:\n\n&quot;The server has not found anything matching the Request-URI. No \nindication is given of whether the condition is temporary or permanent. \nThe 410 (Gone) status code SHOULD be used if the server knows, through \nsome internally configurable mechanism, that an old resource is \npermanently unavailable and has no forwarding address. This status code \nis commonly used when the server does not wish to reveal exactly why the \nrequest has been refused, or when no other response is applicable.&quot;\n\nSo my understanding is that 410 is a stronger variant of 404: &quot;there&#39;s \nnothing here, and it&#39;s going to stay that way&quot;.\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n\n\n"}}
