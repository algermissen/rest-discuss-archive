Between OO-RPC - which is basically the Web\nservices style - and REST, there&#39;s definitely a *lot* of overlap.\n\n&gt; For example if under REST &quot;hypertext\n&gt; is the engine of application state&quot;, a tuple-space application&#39;s state\n&gt; might well be determined by URIs being put up into the tuple space, with\n&gt; documents being taken down from the tuple space and returned to the larger\n&gt; system.\n\nI don&#39;t think that&#39;s a great example, but I&#39;m all for thinking about\nnew constraints which could be added to REST to induce new useful\nproperties, such as Rohit&#39;s work on ALIN.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
