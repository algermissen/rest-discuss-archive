Client state is opaque,\n&gt; except that it must have enough state to interpret a response.  Server state is\n&gt; exposed using HTTP methods.  Clients have always been less prone to security\n&gt; problems than servers, because they expose so much less state.  The only client\n&gt; resource exposed is the state machine that performs the request.  For a callback\n&gt; sink to be no less secure than a client request, the only resource the sink can\n&gt; expose is a similar state machine.\n\nWhy do you call this a state machine?\n\nNote that as soon as you do a callback you are exposing the fact that\nyou are running software that accepts HTTP connections. I could see that\nas having security implications if that software is poorly written but\nthere isn&#39;t much we can do about that.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
