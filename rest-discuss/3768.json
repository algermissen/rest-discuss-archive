When parsing the path, is it better to\n&gt; &gt; check authentication as soon as you encounter &#39;client&#39; or should you\nwait\n&gt; &gt; until you have parsed the entire path and confirmed whether the path\n(and\n&gt; &gt; therefore request URI) is valid or not?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you authenticate first, it would be possible to request\nauthentication\n&gt; &gt; for a URI that&#39;s not even valid.  On the other hand, authenticating only\n&gt; &gt; valid URIs would possibly allow a malicious user to &quot;discover&quot; valid\nURIs\n&gt; &gt; without being authenticated.\n&gt;\n&gt; If a valid URI does not convey any authority (ie: the client must\n&gt; be authenticated to use it), there is no need to worry about\n&gt; &quot;discovery&quot; of valid URIs. From a security point of view, you\n&gt; should assume that if your URIs are guessable, the attacker has\n&gt; already guessed them.\n\nHmm... I suppose that&#39;s true....\n\n&gt; Note that the type of URI you are proposing &#39;/client/xyz&#39; is\n&gt; exactly the type of RESTless URI we were discussing in the\n&gt; previous thread.\n\nActually, the example URI was a bit on the generic side to avoid discussions\nof URI construction...  In the case of the application I&#39;m working on,\nthere&#39;s a one-to-one relationship between the URI and the user (i.e. I don&#39;t\nhave multiple people logging in at the /client level).\n\nSeairth\n\n\n"}}
