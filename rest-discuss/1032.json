How much of a product is available to promise at a future time?\n&gt; For example, how many blue shoes can I get by tomorrow?\n&gt; The answer is a quantity.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. Is a specified quantity of a product at a specified time?\n&gt; For example, can I get 100 blue shoes tomorrow?\n&gt; The answer is a boolean.\n&gt;\n&gt; This query might be offered to a customer to use before they place an\n&gt; order, or it might be used by the order-taking Web resource before\n&gt; accepting an order.\n&gt;\n&gt; In REST terms, I assume this is a GET with parameters, and the Web\n&gt; resource to address is the Product (i.e. BlueShoe).\n&gt;\n&gt; How would you say it?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Bob Haugen\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
