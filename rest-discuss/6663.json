If the only way you\n&gt; will get to product 345 is via direct links from other web pages on your\n&gt; site and the sites of others, then the second form is fine and preferred\n&gt; by many. However, existing HTML forms technology prefers urls to have a\n&gt; query part. As such, if you want your user to type &quot;345&quot; into a form and\n&gt; get your URL you should use the first url.\n&gt;\n&gt; As a guess, I would think that this won&#39;t be a constraint for this\n&gt; particular case. It would usually only affect the URLs that a search\n&gt; form looks up. These are more likely to be something like\n&gt; &lt;http://example.com/search?terms=cuddly+bear+toys&maxprice=15&gt;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Benjamin\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n-- \nStelios Eliakis\n\n"}}
