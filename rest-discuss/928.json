I&#39;m interested\nin collecting more myths to add to this page, so let me have &#39;em\nif you&#39;ve got &#39;em. :-)\n\nI&#39;ve also got the rough outline of a page [2] on the different\nkinds and qualities of names.  It&#39;s barely an outline at this\npoint;  what I&#39;d like to do with it is ultimately construct a\ntaxonomy of different kinds of names and a table of the\noperations and characteristics each supports.  In my own\ninvestigation of opacity I&#39;ve concluded that the refusal to\nrecognize the differences between names and addresses by e.g. TBL\nis probably more of a historical / cultural response to the\ncontentiousness of discussing various ideas about naming and\nidentity in the early Web than it is a well-formed technical\nviewpoint.  I&#39;d like to clear out the fog of confusion a bit and\ngive us a vocabulary to use in discussing names and their\napplications.\n\n$0.02, and feedback welcome,*\n\njb\n\n[1] http://conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/OpacityMythsDebunked\n[2] http://conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/KindsOfNames\n\n* always welcome, though dogma discouraged. ;-)\n\n\n"}}
