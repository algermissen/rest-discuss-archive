Http has that\nunder control.  Even when used with novel media typ=\r\nes the interface is\nstill uniform.  Resources are still identified, resourc=\r\nes are still\nmanipulated through representations, the messages are still\nse=\r\nlf-descriptive, and (assuming the media-type is well defined)\nhypermedia is=\r\n still the engine of application state.  The uniform\ninterface section[1] i=\r\ns completely silent on how ubiquitous support of\nrepresentations needs to b=\r\ne.\n\nI fail so see how &quot;separation of concerns, scalability and independent\n=\r\nevolvability&quot; come into play regarding this particular design\ndecision.  Th=\r\ne client and server concerns are still separate; custom\nmedia types are jus=\r\nt cachable as any other media type; custom media\ntypes do not, innately, da=\r\nmage the evolvability of the system.  In\nfact, custom media types are just =\r\nyet another &quot;downloadable\nfeature-engine&quot; that help &quot;provide for a diverse =\r\nset of\nfunctionality&quot;.[2]\n\n&gt; Peter, sorry but the last thing I&#39;m going to d=\r\no is encourage J=F8rn, or\n&gt; anybody here, to go and invent a &quot;custom (vendo=\r\nr) media type&quot; for use on the\n&gt; internet without mentioning the massive cav=\r\neat that only they will\n&gt; understand it - the terms &quot;Universal&quot; and &quot;Custom=\r\n (Vendor)&quot; are far from\n&gt; complementary.\n\nWho said anything about encouragi=\r\nng the use of custom media types?  I\nam merely pointing out the statement &quot;=\r\nXML and JSON certainly aren&#39;t\nRESTful&quot; is false.  It might not be a good id=\r\nea in J=F8rn situation, but\nin some situations it is.\n\n&gt; I&#39;ll probably blac=\r\nk-list myself from the rest community with this next\n&gt; comment, but can thi=\r\ns whole culture of run to a custom media type whenever\n&gt; things get tricky =\r\nand label it as RESTful and &quot;a good thing&quot; culture please\n&gt; just stop, it&#39;s=\r\n a new year ahead, it&#39;s painfully obvious that it /doesn&#39;t/\n&gt; work (in real=\r\nity) and that it ensures the REST community is small and\n&gt; massively misund=\r\nerstood by almost everybody because it detaches from even\n&gt; the simplest lo=\r\ngic and reality. People put things on the web so they are\n&gt; universally acc=\r\nessible, people share things so they can be seen by others,\n&gt; that&#39;s the wh=\r\nole damn point.\n\nThe problem with your argument is that custom media types =\r\n*do* work\n(in reality).  They work on the corporate network.  They work on =\r\nthe\npublic internet.  They work in a box with a fox.  I know they work\nfrom=\r\n personal experience.\n\nCustom media types might be inferior to you preferre=\r\nd approach.  If\nyou believe that to be true please argue that.  Not that us=\r\ning custom\nmedia types is unrestful.\n\n[1]: http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding=\r\n/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_1_5\n[2]: http://www.ics.uci.ed=\r\nu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_2_1\n\nPeter\nbarelyen=\r\nough.org\n\n"}}
