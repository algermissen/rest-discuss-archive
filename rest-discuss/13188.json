For instance:\n\nPOST /api/v1/user/appliance=\r\ns/&lt;id&gt;/cmd/remove_package?name=3D&lt;name&gt;\n\nIs used to *remove* a package from=\r\n a virtual appliance.\n\nWouldn&#39;t a more restful approach be something like\n\n=\r\nDELETE /user/appliances/&lt;id&gt;/packages/&lt;name&gt;\n\nAny comments that will help m=\r\ny understanding of REST principles are greatly appreciated. Also, if you ca=\r\nn help me to understand why they would have chosen one way over the other. =\r\nThe site is built on Ruby on Rails (according to their twitter stream). \n\n\n"}}
