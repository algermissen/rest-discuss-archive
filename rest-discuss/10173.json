I like\nthis pattern because, along with making it relatively easy to support\npartial PUTs, it also has the potential to create a audit log of the\nupdates. i&#39;ve relied on this to create a simplistic change-log that\nadmins can review.\n\nHowever, a rather nasty side-effect of this kind of pattern is that it\ncan create problems with the data integrity of the underlying\nresource. I only allow partial updates on elements that are optional\nand do not directly affect flow control. that way, users can&#39;t change\nthe state of the object in a way that invalidates it (vis-a-vis other\npartial update elements from other parties). I have to take care to\nkeep the resource consistent and sometimes even have to create\nresources that require more than one element in the partial update:\n\n&lt;partial-resource&gt;\n  &lt;shipping-address&gt;\n    &lt;street /&gt;\n    &lt;city /&gt;\n    &lt;region /&gt;\n    &lt;postal-code /&gt;\n  &lt;/shipping-address&gt;\n&lt;/partial-resource&gt;\n\nFor flow-control items (i.e. change from &quot;pending&quot; to &quot;approved&quot;) I\nalmost always create a new resource anyway. These are most often\ncritical state changes that need to be atomic and isolated anyway.\nFinally, for relatively small or very dynamic resources, I find it&#39;s\nbetter to force a full PUT and take advantage of ETags to prevent the\n&quot;Lost Update&quot; problems.\n\nMikeA\n\nOn Jan 2, 2008 5:52 PM, Ebenezer Ikonne &lt;amaeze@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Is &#39;update&#39; a noun or verb?
