Here is an\nexcerpt from section 9.6[1] regarding the PUT/POSt contrast:\n\n&quot;The fundamental difference between the POST and PUT requests is reflected\nin the different meaning of the Request-URI. The URI in a POST request\nidentifies the resource that will handle the enclosed entity. That resource\nmight be a data-accepting process, a gateway to some other protocol, or a\nseparate entity that accepts annotations. In contrast, the URI in a PUT\nrequest identifies the entity enclosed with the request -- the user agent\nknows what URI is intended and the server MUST NOT attempt to apply the\nrequest to some other resource.&quot;\n\nTo paraphrase, POST identifies the resource that will handle your request,\nand PUT identifies the resource itself.\n\n-Philip\n\n1. http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.6\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Seairth Jacobs [mailto:seairth@...]\nSent: Thursday, August 22, 2002 12:20 PM\nTo: rest-discuss\nSubject: [rest-discuss] Just when I thought I had it...\n\n\nI thought I had finally figured out the POST vs. PUT thing, then this last\nthread (PUT and POST clarification) comes along and everything gets fuzzy\nagain.
