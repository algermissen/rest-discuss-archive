I want consumer of my web service to be able to post in\n&gt; localized version of string.\n\nI&#39;d really want to know a bit more about what you are doing before \nadvising. I&#39;m not clear exactly what you are doing from your examples.\n\n&gt; Which among the following is preferable:\n&gt; For eg.\n&gt; &lt;emotion culture=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Happy&lt;/emotion&gt;\n&gt; &lt;emotion culture=&quot;fr-fr&quot;&gt;Foobar&lt;/emotion&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Or\n&gt; &lt;emotion&gt;&lt;resource&gt;&lt;id&gt;45&lt;/id&gt;&lt;value&gt;happy&lt;/value&gt;&lt;/resource&gt;&lt;/\n&gt; emotion&gt;\n\nThe first is definitely clearer and semantically stronger, though if you \nare concerned only with language (as opposed to other cultural issues) \nthen xml:lang seems more sensible.\n\nI&#39;m not understanding where this fits into a REST interface though.\n\n\n"}}
