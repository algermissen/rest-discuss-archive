Namely:\n&gt;\n&gt; - What do you think of the idea of having an interface definition\n&gt; language for REST services ? It seems some people outright reject the\n&gt; idea, while others support it in the form of WADL.\n&gt; It seems to me something like that would be nice to have, allowing for\n&gt; example Yahoo, Google and Microsoft to agree on a unified API for\n&gt; searches, that would be published using the IDL of choice. Client\n&gt; could then switch fairly easily from an implementation to another.\n&gt; Which leads to my second question...\n&gt;\n&gt;\nhttp://bitworking.org/news/193/Do-we-need-WADL\n&gt; - Is there any ongoing attempt at establishing a standard for service\n&gt; registries ? If we were to have that kind of domain-specific\n&gt; standardized services, it would probably be interesting to have\n&gt; registries of interesting service interfaces along with running\n&gt; implementations. Which could be automatically tested for liveness by\n&gt; the registry, possibly using information from the IDL (testing\n&gt; published resources actually are there and respond to advertised\n&gt; verbs, etc).\n&gt;\n&gt;\nWe have one failed approach (with UDDI) already; not sure why we&#39;d  \nneed another one.\nFor enterprisey (governance) aspects, some thoughts here:\nhttp://www.innoq.com/blog/st/2007/07/26/governance_and_rest.html\n\n&gt; Sorry if this sound very naive, as I said, I&#39;m a newcomer. I did read\n&gt; the previous thread about WADL but it seemed to drift to a discussion\n&gt; of the merits of WADL itself and not IDLs for REST in general.\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Olivier Pernet\n&gt;\n&gt; We are the knights who say\n&gt; echo &#39;16i[q]sa[ln0=aln100%Pln100/snlbx]sbA0D4D465452snlbxq&#39;|dc\n&gt;\n:-)\n\n"}}
