If a human meets some unexpected state =\r\nduring shopping they  \n&gt; either give up or return to the home page and try =\r\nagain - something  \n&gt; you could make the computer do as well.\n\nYes, I agree=\r\n - in part. The situation is basically the same but human  \nusers are capab=\r\nle of following unexpected links to a certain extend,  \nsimply because they=\r\n can read and to some extend figure out what the  \nservice owner is trying =\r\nto say with the new link (or go and read  \ndocumentation). For example, Ama=\r\nzon can add &quot;1 click&quot; functionality  \nand a human user will pretty likely f=\r\nigure out what it means and , if  \ndesired, use it. This is where REST shin=\r\nes so bright because it is  \nreally the service that drives that client. Su=\r\nre, the overall goal of  \nthe client (e.g. buying a book) must be achievabl=\r\ne so if Amazon turned  \ninto a Site for taking your theretical drivers lice=\r\nnse test the human  \nclient fails, too.\n\nMachine clients canot take an unex=\r\npected transition. Never. (Assuming  \nany kind of AI is not part of the dis=\r\ncussion).\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The do not have their own state machine.\n&gt;&gt; The do not foll=\r\now an overall goal.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think the issue is just the same for humans as we=\r\nll as for  \n&gt; computers. A human usually have a goal - if I go to a shop I =\r\nwant to  \n&gt; buy something (or compare prices). I might just be bored and su=\r\nrf  \n&gt; around, but that&#39;s another situation - you don&#39;t program computers  =\r\n\n&gt; to be bored :-)\n\nAgreed.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Remember websites back in approx. year 200=\r\n0 - at that time most  \n&gt; people didn&#39;t know about webshops, all webshops w=\r\nere different,  \n&gt; there was no agreed-upon idea of the UI for a shop, and =\r\npeople  \n&gt; *really* had a hard time figuring out how to browse, shop and pa=\r\ny.  \n&gt; But over time we, as users, has learned, just like the webshops has =\r\n \n&gt; become more similar. We, the users, look for a search text field if  \n&gt;=\r\n we want to search by a text, or we look for a menu to browse by  \n&gt; catego=\r\nry. Then we figure out where the price is located, then we  \n&gt; look for the=\r\n &quot;buy&quot; button ... an so on. We keep looking for more or  \n&gt; less well defin=\r\ned markers (relations) of how-to-do-what-to-do-next.\n&gt;\n&gt; We have *learned* =\r\nto recognize the &quot;webshop media type&quot; - it  \n&gt; consists of text/shop.catego=\r\nries+html, text/shop.item+html, text/ \n&gt; shop.order+html and so on. It&#39;s no=\r\nt exactly standardized, but as  \n&gt; humans it&#39;s good enough for us.\n\nExactly=\r\n. &quot;It&#39;s good enough for us&quot; is what really enables the service  \nto evolve =\r\nwithout breaking the whole interaction. Humans can follow  \n(for the most p=\r\nart).\n&gt;\n&gt; If you were to program a computer such that it could by a book, t=\r\nhen  \n&gt; you would teach it how to behave when presented with a text/ \n&gt; sho=\r\np.categories+html (or rather application/shop.categories+xml)  \n&gt; document.=\r\n In all of the shop media types there would be a general  \n&gt; &quot;navigation&quot; p=\r\nart and this would be used to navigate to the place  \n&gt; where the program c=\r\nould do what it wanted.\n&gt;\n&gt; First your program would be looking for an appl=\r\nication/ \n&gt; shop.categories+xml ressource: given the root URL, it would bro=\r\nwse  \n&gt; around until it found it, exactly like any human would do. Then it =\r\n \n&gt; would browse for a category, or search for a word etc. until it  \n&gt; fou=\r\nnd a suitable application/shop.item+xml ressource with attributes  \n&gt; enoug=\r\nh for the program to recognize it as the item it was looking for.\n\nFull agr=\r\neement until this point. Works fine.\n\n\n&gt; Then it would look for the &quot;buy&quot; r=\r\nelation,\n\nHere is the point, though. &quot;Looking for the &quot;Buy&quot; relation manife=\r\nsts  \nthe assumption that it will be available from an item in a serach  \nr=\r\nesult.&quot; If the service stops providing it at this point the client  \nbreaks=\r\n. The service cannot insert extra hops with human readable  \ndocumentation =\r\nto direct the cliet to a place where it finally finds  \nthe &quot;buy&quot; relation.=\r\n\n\nThis might not sound so unexpected or bad after all, but it is  \nequivale=\r\nnt to specifying this:\n\n&quot;Representations of items provide a &quot;buy&quot; relation&quot;=\r\n and if you do this  \nin a spec, you do effectively two things:\n\n- make use=\r\n of a resource &#39;type&#39; named item\n- assert a minimal guarrantee about the re=\r\npresentation of an item\n\nBoth violate REST&#39;s hypermedia constraint because =\r\nthe enable an  \nassumption about the state machine at design time instead o=\r\nf making  \nthe state machine discoverable.\n\nIt might not look like a big de=\r\nal, but if you apply the situation to  \nintra-enterprise services you reach=\r\n a point rather quickly where your  \nmedia type specifications look like OO=\r\n class definitions with regard  \nto the contract they impose. And then you =\r\n(at least I) wonder how much  \nevolvability is really left on the server si=\r\nde that is guarranteed not  \nto break any of your clients, never.\n\n(And aga=\r\nin: I am all for REST inside the enterprise, I just want to do  \nmy homewor=\r\nk :-) Suppose you are asked this: &quot;Fine then. Seems that  \nsearches MUST re=\r\nsult in lists of items and that items MUST be  \nrepresented by media type X=\r\nY. So, what&#39;s this independent evolvability  \nthingy about? Tell me, *what*=\r\n in fact am I allowed to change in my  \nserver that makes REST systems any =\r\nmore decoupled than others?)\n\nYes, there are substantial other benefits (vi=\r\nsibility, simplicity, no  \nvendor lock in, decade-proven technology with bi=\r\nllions of users  \nprotecting the investment in HTTP), but if I am going to =\r\nstress  \nindependent evolvability, I&#39;d better have a hands on answer to tha=\r\nt one)\n\n\n&gt; and this would lead it to a application/shop.orders+xml ressourc=\r\ne  \n&gt; and so on and so on.\n&gt;\n&gt; I see no difference between the human&#39;s or t=\r\nhe computer&#39;s way of  \n&gt; interacting with the shop, except for one thing: s=\r\ntandardization - a  \n&gt; human is extremely more flexible than a computer whe=\r\nn trying to  \n&gt; recognize a thing. But besides that it&#39;s same same.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; So=\r\n in my point of view everything is fine. The human web is RESTful,  \n&gt; comp=\r\nuters can work in same way, ergo the computer web is RESTful to.\n\nSo then, =\r\nyou&#39;d say that it is perfectly RESTful that AtomPub  \neffectively says &quot;a G=\r\nET on a collection MUST at least return  \napplication/atom+xml&quot;?\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; What=\r\n did I miss?\n\nNothing really. For one, I seem to be very bad at getting thi=\r\ns across  \n(or maybe I am plain dumb) on the other hand I&#39;d just add to you=\r\nr  \nthoughts that it is exactly the human flexibility that is the  \ndiffere=\r\nnce.\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards, J=F8rn\n&gt;\n\n--------------------------------------\nJ=\r\nan Algermissen\n\nMail: algermissen@...\nBlog: http://algermissen.blogspot=\r\n.com/\nHome: http://www.jalgermissen.com\n-----------------------------------=\r\n---\n\n\n\n\n"}}
