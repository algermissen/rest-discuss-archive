I doubt we disagree, but I think your wording leads the\nwrong direction; taken out of the context of the thesis, &quot;the presence\nof application control information&quot; may be easily misconstrued to also\napply to javascript, when Roy meant it as linking/posting.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 1 - &quot;A Hypermedia Client supports advancing it&#39;s own application\n&gt; state based on application control information supplied in server\n&gt; responses.&quot;\n&gt;\n\nImplies that the server controls the application state, first by using\n&quot;client&quot; instead of &quot;user-agent&quot;.  It&#39;s the user who chooses which\napplication state to transition to; one option is a return to the\nprevious state (back button), which isn&#39;t supplied in server responses.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; 2 - &quot;A Hypermedia Client supports advancing application state by\n&gt; sending requests to servers based on application control information\n&gt; supplied in server responses.&quot;\n&gt; \n\nUser-agents are supposed to follow their noses, this sounds like servers\nleading user-agents about by the nose.  What I mean is, the server can\nonly supply state-transition *options* (control information), not state-\ntransition *control* (control directives).  It violates REST to use HTML\nmeta-redirection.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 3 - &quot;A Hypermedia Client supports advancing application state by\n&gt; sending requests to servers based on application control information\n&gt; embedded within, or as a layer above, the presentation of information\n&gt; supplied in server responses.&quot;\n&gt; \n\nStill doesn&#39;t account for that pesky back button; nor does it account\nfor state transitions derived from user input, IP address or REFERER\nheader.  Your wording makes it sound like the user-agent has knowledge\nof what application state will result from following a given transition.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
