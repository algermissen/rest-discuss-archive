To some extent,\nREA is incorporated in the &quot;standards&quot; of each of those organizations.\n Explicitly so for ISO:\nhttp://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=40348\n\nebXML and UN/CEFACT also tried to &quot;standardize&quot; an application\nprotocol for exchanging business messages using a somewhat-REA-based\nvocabulary.\n\nThe reason I put quotes around &quot;standardize&quot; is that all three of\nthose groups claimed to provide &quot;standards&quot;, all three coming from the\nsame background sources (EDI and REA), and all three are slightly\ndifferent.\n\nLikewise OASIS Universal Business Language (UBL)\nhttp://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=ubl also\nspun off from ebXML, and claims to provide yet another &quot;standard&quot; B2B\nvocabulary, derived mostly from X12 and EDIFACT EDI without any REA\ninfluence.\n\nAnd then there&#39;s OAG http://www.openapplications.org/ which also\nclaims to provide &quot;standard&quot; business document formats.\n\nAnd some large supply chain heads use their own proprietary vocabularies.\n\nAnd the old EDI formats - ANSII X12 and UN EDIFACT - are probably\nstill used more than any of the above.\n\n"}}
