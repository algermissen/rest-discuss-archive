The important part is that the state of the resource after the\n&gt;&gt; PUT does only depend on the payload, not the previous state.\n&gt; \n&gt; The server is free to use the state represented in the PUT request *as\n&gt; well* as the current state if it wants to.  For example, the resource\n&gt; may include a counter that tracks how many PUTs it received.  The\n&gt; important part from a REST perspective is that the meaning of the PUT\n&gt; message is independent of the state of the resource.\n\nHmm, is that not independent of other the state of the resource though, \nsurely that&#39;s just another resource which tracks that state of &quot;this&quot; \none? Similarly when it comes to defining additional resources, for \ninstance on might PUT to http:// which also exposes on https://, or one \nmight PUT to /latest whereupon the server also defines an additional \narchived version at another URI.\n\nBest,\n\nNathan\n\n"}}
