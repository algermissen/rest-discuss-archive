I&#39;m certainly not dismissing Atom yet a=\r\nnd I hope I&#39;m learning a lot from it and this discussion. \n\nYou mention a f=\r\need of feed approach... would that be a &lt;feed&gt; element that represents the =\r\nparent resource, which then contained an &lt;entry&gt; for each &quot;collection&quot;? Wit=\r\nh the &lt;entry&gt; containing a link to the feed for that child collection (and =\r\npossibly also containing an &lt;inline&gt; to provide a high level view of the ch=\r\nild feed&#39;s content)?\n\nI think what I&#39;m missing is some good examples of usi=\r\nng Atom outside of the basic scenario. So given a resource that has propert=\r\nies of its own, and perhaps is linked to at least one possibly two collecti=\r\nons of other resources... how would you represent it? What XML would you en=\r\nvisage being returned when the parent is requested?\n\nThanks everyone for yo=\r\nur time!\n\n\n\n"}}
