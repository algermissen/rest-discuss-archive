In particular I see the first two\nsteps as being unnecessary extra coordination headache. Listeners are\nnot files. Practically speaking the component that implements a listener\nis a CGI-alike. It looks like:\n\nhttp://intermediary.com/listener.cgi?user=paulp\n\nNow without any further coordination with the intermediary, I can go all\nover the Web registering URIs like:\n\nhttp://intermediary.com/listener.cgi?user=paulp&site=http://www.slashdot.org\nhttp://intermediary.com/listener.cgi?user=paulp&site=http://www.news.com\nhttp://intermediary.com/listener.cgi?user=paulp&site=http://www.slate.com\n\n...\n\nThe listeners are dynamically created. Or they are in theory &quot;always\nthere&quot; like every possible Google query is a resource that is always\navailable.\n\nI configure these by fiddling with listener.cgi, maybe through a web\npage. For instance I might tell it to reject notifications from\nparticular domains or the opposite, reject notifications from domains I\nhaven&#39;t told you about. Or reject notifications that don&#39;t have a magic\ncookie header. Generally you would manage subscriptions in bulk, not\nper-URI, although you could of course do that too if listener.cgi\nhappens to support it.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
