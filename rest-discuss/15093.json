I hadn&#39;t read anything else about it.. ju=\r\nst that it was basically a much easier way of doing xml-rpc using http.\n\nTh=\r\nen I learned about Jersey almost 2 years ago or so.. and started to underst=\r\nand the use of the various methods for CRUD like operations. I still used i=\r\nt much like HTTP RPC, only now it was to resources and I avoided query para=\r\nms except for filtering results on a GET call to a collection resource.\n\nLa=\r\ntely, as Jan and others can testify to, I&#39;ve been asking a lot of questions=\r\n to try to grasp the real REST meaning, and I&#39;ve struggled with a few remai=\r\nning concepts of it, but I have learned a lot from this forum and the jerse=\r\ny forum, a few books, and such. \n\nI tend to think most developers read a li=\r\nttle bit about REST and come away with much the same thing I did.. an easie=\r\nr RPC like mechanism using HTTP methods and headers. Even the use of media =\r\ntypes is not very common as those I talk to just use application/xml or app=\r\nlication/json for request and response types.\n\nI&#39;ll be honest.. learning th=\r\ne &quot;true&quot; RESTful API style has put me off a little bit. For example, while =\r\nworking on a service that you would make a REST call to enable/disable some=\r\nthing, it seemed less likely that REST was the proper architecture to use, =\r\nyet I wanted to provide a single API, not two disjointed APIs. I am still n=\r\not 100% clear on if such things are within the realm of using REST to chang=\r\ne application state to turn something on or off for example, I think it&#39;s f=\r\nine, but I do see how it can be quite confusing trying to learn about resou=\r\nrce state and application state, especially with many of us coming from the=\r\n servlet/httpsession stateful side of things and trying to grasp this conce=\r\npt of the client maintains the state (when there are two states) and so for=\r\nth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- On Wed, 3/31/10, William Martinez Pomares &lt;wmartinez@acoscomp=\r\n.com&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom: William Martinez Pomares &lt;wmartinez@...&gt;\nSubje=\r\nct: [rest-discuss] What do you think about REST being a synonym of Service =\r\ncreation technique?\nTo: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Wednesday, March=\r\n 31, 2010, 6:25 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      Hello all=\r\n.\n\nI got the newsletter from InfoQ this week, and suddenly I noticed someth=\r\ning that has been there since long, but till now I didn&#39;t realize it.\n\n\n\nIn=\r\n the SOA channel articles and news, there were only one of each.
