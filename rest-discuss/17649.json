The difference between that and\n&gt; an equivalent specific XML format for representation is, really, hair\n&gt; splitting. Even the size is likely not dramatically different.\n&gt; \n\nThere&#39;s one difference that isn&#39;t splitting hairs -- incremental\nrendering / user-perceived performance.  Or, if we&#39;re talking about\nmachine users as opposed to humans, stream processing -- can the\napplication start doing useful work before the document has finished\ntransferring?\n\nAs Roy says in Chapter 2.3.1, &quot;[S]oftware cannot avoid the basic cost\nof achieving the application needs; e.g., if the application requires\nthat data be located on system A and processed on system B, then the\nsoftware cannot avoid moving that data from A to B.&quot;  Being stream-\nprocessable compensates for this basic cost, which is why I still prefer\nXHTML as application/xhtml+xml -- see the very end of Chapter 6.5.4.2,\nthis approach avoids the lazy HTML parsing problem.\n\nAll too often, I shudder when reviewing media types, as no thought has\nbeen given to incremental rendering.  Designing markup languages is\neasy; designing them to drive application state while allowing stream\nprocessing is hard.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
