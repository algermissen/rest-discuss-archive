I&#39;m normally a lurker but I have a quetion for the group.\n: \n: Let me paint the scenario for you:\n: \n: I have a Resource. If the User is anonymous, when they GET the\n: Resource, the Representation returned displays one set of information.\n: However, if the User if of the type Admin, the Representation returned\n: displays the same information, but with additional information\n: relevant to the Admin User.\n: \n: My question is this: should the decision to display this different\n: response data rest with the Resource, or the Representation: that is,\n: should the Resource always return ALL the information, regardless of\n: the User type, and let the Representation determine this information\n: to be returned based on User type, or should the data the Resource\n: returns be limited based on User type? The latter would, in effect\n: create two Resources, whereas the first would call the same Resource,\n: and filter the response based on rules defined in the Representation.\n: \n: I feel that the Resource should return all the information and that it\n: is the responsibility of the Representation to determine what is\n: displayed. What do you guys think?\n: \n: Cheers!\n: \n: Ben\n: \n: \n: \n: \n: __________ NOD32 1975 (20070113) Information __________\n: \n: This message was checked by NOD32 antivirus system.\n: http://www.eset.com\n: \n:\n\n"}}
