In general, you would POST your query to the (opaque!)\n&gt; URI of the collection you&#39;re querying.\n\nI disagree.\n\nSomewhere the client will have to have it &quot;explained&quot; to it how to \neither construct the URI or how to construct the representation it will \nPOST to the URI (and will have to be told that URI as well).\n\nIf the information comes from a representation (an HTML form is an \nexample of how this could happen for either GET or POST) then the \nconstraint of hypermedia as engine is fulfilled, otherwise it isn&#39;t.\n\nThis is orthogonal to reasons for chosing GET or POST.\n\n"}}
