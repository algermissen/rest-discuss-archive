I said it&#39;s only *designed* fo=\r\nr the common case of\n&gt; &gt; the Web, taken directly from Dr. Fielding&#39;s disser=\r\ntation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; And however said dissertation title refers to &quot;Design of N=\r\network-based\n&gt; Software Architectures&quot;. Now, is the Web the only &quot;Network-b=\r\nased\n&gt; Software Architectures&quot; we have? Isn&#39;t a enterprise-wide architectur=\r\ne\n&gt; a network-based one? Or a extranet-based architecture? Certainly the\n&gt; =\r\nprevious work of Dr. Fielding on the web is the foundation for his\n&gt; disser=\r\ntation, but my understanding of it, it encompasses far more than\n&gt; &quot;the Web=\r\n&quot;...\n&gt; \n\nYes, it does.  Re-read the summary at the end of Roy&#39;s dissertatio=\r\nn.\nIt lays the groundwork for understanding network-based software\narchitec=\r\nture, then applies that knowledge to describe a new\narchitectural style opt=\r\nimized for the &quot;common case of the Web&quot;.  The\ninsight contained in the diss=\r\nertation could be used to devise a new\narchitectural style called &quot;FEST&quot; wh=\r\nich takes into account the\nspecialized needs of an enterprise-wide architec=\r\nture, if those needs\nare significantly different from the common case of th=\r\ne Web.  The\nresulting design could optimize PUT, for example, but this may =\r\nvery\nwell require de-optimizing GET.  It may even be a uniform interface.\nI=\r\nt wouldn&#39;t be REST, but would qualify as &quot;inspired by REST&quot;.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
