But no, I have the same\n&gt; issue with either, a) expecting the query results in the POST response,\n&gt; and b) expecting the query results in a GET on the returned Location\n&gt; URI.  The issue is not the mechanism, it&#39;s the additional expectation,\n&gt; since it&#39;s not one that can be met by other resources and therefore\n&gt; neither uniform nor RESTful.  \n\nBut in this case it&#39;s not being handled by a single\nresource but a set of resources, each that behaves\nuniformly with respect to the methods used.\n\nSaid another way, I couldn&#39;t POST a query\n&gt; document to any old resource and expect it to understand that I expect\n&gt; back the results, nor could I assume that anything I got back from an\n&gt; arbitrary resource was the results of the query document being processed\n&gt; as a query.\n\nSo what do you think would be the most RESTish way to handle this?\n\t\n\t-joe\n\n-- \nhttp://BitWorking.org\nhttp://WellFormedWeb.org\n\n"}}
