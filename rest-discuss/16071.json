In this system I would like the client to be able to set the sta=\r\nte of a particular resource, but if the normal representation of that resou=\r\nrce has handy hypertext links - wouldn&#39;t the client need to send content wi=\r\nth those exact hypertext links? If so that seems fragile as the links typic=\r\nally are determined by the server and this implies the client also needs to=\r\n be able to determine those.\n\nSpecifically, I&#39;m working on system to manage=\r\n two-party contracts (really, just orders) and would like to support indivi=\r\ndual &#39;contributions&#39; from each party and a master &#39;reconciled&#39; contract tha=\r\nt is composed from the two contributions based on business rules. I would l=\r\nike the master &#39;reconciled&#39; contract to link to the composite contracts and=\r\n also for the composite contracts to have a link back to the final reconcil=\r\ned contract that results from rules being enforced. How would a client use =\r\nPUT to modify a &#39;contribution&#39; resource if that resource is supposed to hav=\r\ne a link somewhere that the client doesn&#39;t know about?\n\nI know I can just u=\r\nse POST to modify resources so that the entity submitted doesn&#39;t have to be=\r\n exactly the same as the hyperlink-annotated representation of that resourc=\r\ne, but I was wondering if there&#39;s a common or better way to do this?\n\n\n\n"}}
