Sudden=\r\nly you\n&gt; impose having an xml parser and other semantics in a container for=\r\nmat and\n&gt; get dragged into wrapping your content-types within yet another c=\r\nontent-type\n&gt; to manage.\n&gt;\n&gt; The so-called reuse of content-types that atom=\r\n provides is an illusion as\n&gt; your entities will still need to exist in a f=\r\normat you have to define.\n&gt;\n&gt; Saying the complexity is being absorbed by th=\r\ne frameworks is like saying\n&gt; transactions will magically all scale because=\r\n we have WS-AtomicTransactions.\n&gt; It&#39;s not true, it requires more and more =\r\nlayers of tools and toolkits and\n&gt; increase the price you pay for your firs=\r\nt shot.\n\nExactly.\n\nAssaf\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Be it in flash, XHR or plain Html forms, atom=\r\n is not supported, and it\n&gt; should probably never be. If you want to pass a=\r\ntom because the format makes\n&gt; sense and the client negotiated, that is qui=\r\nte fine. If you pass everything\n&gt; wrapped in ATOM saying that somehow putti=\r\nng an entity in an xml feed is\n&gt; fine, in the name of so-called commoditiza=\r\ntion of frameworks (something that\n&gt; companies that have been known to *cre=\r\nate* the WS-* mess are now pushing\n&gt; very hardly for), and not even providi=\r\nng other alternate content types that\n&gt; make sense, is going against the si=\r\nmplicity and capability discovery that\n&gt; REST support out of the box.\n&gt;\n&gt; W=\r\nould you wrap a jpeg file in an atom entry and base64 it? So why do it with=\r\n\n&gt; anything else but namespaced composable xml languages, of which very few=\r\n are\n&gt; actually composeable?\n&gt;\n&gt; Seb\n&gt;\n&gt; ----------------------------------=\r\n----------------\n&gt; From: &quot;Aristotle Pagaltzis&quot; &lt;pagaltzis@...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: T=\r\nuesday, August 05, 2008 11:25 AM\n&gt; To: &quot;Rest List&quot; &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [rest-discuss] Re: forms for web APIs\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * Assaf Arkin =\r\n&lt;assaf@...&gt; [2008-08-05 10:40]:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; You&#39;re right, I don&#39;t do polit=\r\nics. I judge protocols on their\n&gt;&gt;&gt; merit. If a protocol is the best soluti=\r\non for the use cases it\n&gt;&gt;&gt; was designed for, it will surface to the top. B=\r\nut I won&#39;t\n&gt;&gt;&gt; recommend unnecessary complexity to promote a spec.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nIn the long term, that does more harm than good. I&#39;m actually\n&gt;&gt;&gt; surprised=\r\n that we&#39;re not looking at the WS-* agenda games as a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; lesson learned. I=\r\n&#39;m not convinced the answer is more politics,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and I&#39;m very worried abou=\r\nt cargo culting.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#39;s our job to recommend the best technology we k=\r\nnow is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sufficient to solve the problem at hand. And sometimes that\n&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nmeans saying &quot;No. Not for this use case. Use your head, use\n&gt;&gt;&gt; [that] inst=\r\nead.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Hammering is something WS-* has suffered from, and I&#39;d hate t=\r\no\n&gt;&gt;&gt; see the same happen to REST, because once the false claims turn\n&gt;&gt;&gt; i=\r\nnto broken promises, all that&#39;s left is backlash, and backlash\n&gt;&gt;&gt; has a wa=\r\ny of diminishing the value of even the best\n&gt;&gt;&gt; technologies.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You see=\r\nm to have lost the plot. Do you accept that having fewer,\n&gt;&gt; more generical=\r\nly useful media types is good REST design? Is that\n&gt;&gt; for political reasons=\r\n, too? If you find it acceptable, why do you\n&gt;&gt; accept the technical reason=\r\ning there but characterise it as\n&gt;&gt; despicable politics in protocols?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; I&#39;m seeing too many people enveloping everything they send with\n&gt;&gt;&gt; AtomP=\r\nub, for no reason other than it&#39;s AtomPub, so it might be\n&gt;&gt;&gt; good, right? =\r\nI see people who don&#39;t bother to learn REST, they\n&gt;&gt;&gt; just envelope with At=\r\nomPub =97 enveloping is easy, architecture\n&gt;&gt;&gt; style is hard. They&#39;re not e=\r\nven using it right, but they marked\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the checkbox, and yes, there&#39;s one =\r\ncase involving wrapping RPC\n&gt;&gt;&gt; calls inside AtomPub.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; So when the t=\r\nime comes and we get to see SOAP passing over the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; wire, except the enve=\r\nlope is called AtomPub, would we stand\n&gt;&gt;&gt; back and smile and think to ours=\r\nelves &quot;mission accomplished&quot;?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; AtomPub is a good solution, just not =\r\nthe best solution to every\n&gt;&gt;&gt; problem. Using it like a hammer would be wor=\r\nse than not using\n&gt;&gt;&gt; it enough, possibly the worst thing that could happen=\r\n to it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; HTTP has been suffering from a massive case of hammering for =\r\na\n&gt;&gt; decade.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; We need to teach developers how to engineer the right s=\r\nolution,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; that&#39;s the only way they could rise to the problem, not help\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; them cargo cult the next shiny spec or the next best whatever.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I=\r\n don&#39;t see enough of that, and quite frankly it saddens me and\n&gt;&gt;&gt; in some =\r\nway even scares me.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Cargo cult happens. You cannot stop it. All you c=\r\nan do is design\n&gt;&gt; for surviving it. The technologies that succeed in the l=\r\nong term\n&gt;&gt; are those that have been so designed.
