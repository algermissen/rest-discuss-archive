In production systems, things have to be \n&gt;&gt; well planned out and predictable or it will just be a disaster.\n&gt; \n&gt; I certainly agree with you that there are very, very few apps that *do*\n&gt; approach integration in this manner, but I don&#39;t agree that you can&#39;t\n&gt; have apps that *can* approach integration in this manner, even in highly\n&gt; structured, regulated and mission-critical deployments.\n&gt; \n&gt; You bring up a great point:  &quot;if things aren&#39;t well planned out and\n&gt; predictable...things will be a disaster.&quot;  However, if you stop and\n&gt; think about it, do you know why this is true?\n&gt; \n\nIts true because stable systems are well tested.  You can&#39;t test \nvariability.\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve been doing both large & small system integration for over 10 years,\n&gt; and I&#39;ve both lived through the reality you described, and also been\n&gt; trying to find ways to make systems less brittle and more resilient to\n&gt; change because there&#39;s two core axioms of large systems development:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Things are going to change between when you start the system and when\n&gt; you get it &quot;finished&quot;, if ever....\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) The system is likely to live far longer than you expect it to\n&gt; \n&gt; If your integration is based on lots of out-of-band shared knowledge\n&gt; about the system state transitions, you do need a lot of formal planning\n&gt; and predictability in the way they work, because you code the endpoints\n&gt; based on those assumptions.  It&#39;s really a self-fulfilling prophecy,\n&gt; actually.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, if you take the approach that you need to identify and expect a\n&gt; particular number of states and transitions, each of which are specified\n&gt; well rather than working from an API reference manual and system user\n&gt; guide (or functional specification), then you can potentially have more\n&gt; scalable, flexible and long-lived systems.  You can also end up with a\n&gt; big mess if you don&#39;t manage it properly...\n&gt; \n\nFYI, I wasn&#39;t bashing HATEOAS.  I think it is extremely useful to have \nrelationship links embedded in your messages and to traverse these \nlinks.  I just don&#39;t think its realistic to think that a client is going \nto be able to make state transition decisions dynamically based on \nlooking at a self-describing message.  Machines aren&#39;t humans.\n\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
