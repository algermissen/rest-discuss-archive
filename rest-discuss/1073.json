What constraints do you have?\nBringing up the problem domain may result in someone with experience with\nevent systems and another with HTTP/REST and we may get some collaboration\ngoing.\n\nIn general REST and event notification go hand in hand. When applied to\nHTTP, I take the point of view that &quot;events are messages about changes to\ninformation&quot;. The &#39;about&#39; part implies a reference or URI. The &#39;changes&#39;\npart implies a set of operations. The message part doesn&#39;t necessarily imply\nwho initiates the message - which means you can poll for messages or receive\nthem spontaneously.\n\nMy view on events is that they allow talking &#39;about information&#39; across a\nlifetime of a resource - before it exists and after it is gone. I also think\nthe &#39;changes&#39; that are broadcast should be restricted to the methods of the\ngeneric interface you are using.\n\n\n"}}
