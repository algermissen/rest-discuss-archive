The &#39;reply-to&#39; is the \nauthoritative\n&gt; status of the &#39;business response&#39; to the business request. \n\nI can go along with that, depending on what you mean by status.\nThe chain of standards I alluded to in a previous message (UNECE-ISO-\nRosettaNet-ebXML) makes a similar distinction.  ebXML calls the \nbusiness content &quot;Business Documents&quot; and the status \nmessages &quot;Signals&quot;.  \n\nThe status signals tend to be simple ACKs but depending on agreement, \nacceptance could also be a signal.  (Simple cases.)\n\nIn more complex cases, acceptance would be a substantive business \ndocument.  If I understand your proposal correctly, you would always \nmake acceptance a substantive response, which works fine for me.\n\n&gt; Knowing where to put the response is a generic\n&gt; concept to request/response message exchanges. In a typical \nsynchronous\n&gt; request/response, you just send it in the response (in http the \ncorrelation\n&gt; between req/resp happens because of the single connection, a wicked \ncool\n&gt; simplification). \n\nSeems like a good slot for a simple receipt ACK.\n \n&gt; In the sample the status is updated with PUT - but if the server \nwants to\n&gt; keep a history, perhaps it should be POST. But I don&#39;t want the \nclients\n&gt; needing to know what the server intends to do. I&#39;d like to expose \nthe\n&gt; resource as the &#39;current status&#39; - no assumptions about &#39;extending&#39; \nan audit\n&gt; trail - and so I used PUT.  If the server chooses to keep history, \nthen I\n&gt; suppose a new resource is needed for the audit trail - which would \nbe a\n&gt; collection of previously PUT entities.\n\nThe above paragraph seems to imply that you are thinking of something \ndifferent for status than simple ACKs.  \n\nAre you thinking of Delivery and Payment as statuses?  If so, I got \nan argument for you...\n\nBut so far, moving forward.\n\nThanks,\nBob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
