Joe pointed out some examples where clients inspect urls \n(I&#39;d forgotten about https: :&#92;). I think it would depend on the \napplication involved. Or for general purposes, URI templates would need \nto extended to become dictionaries and have named segments:\n\n{base=&quot;http://example.com/&quot;}{id=&quot;myuniqueid&quot;}\n\nie, like a real template/binding language. Which I think is getting \ncomplicated and EPRish.\n\nThe last time this got interesting was when Jon Udell started \nintegrating libraries and amazon by scraping ISBNs out of Amazon URLs. I \nnever head of anybody directly criticizing what he was doing; maybe it \nwas because it was an insanely useful integration, despite the means.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n\n\n\n"}}
