I&#39;ll also assume the converse, that anything \nidentified by a URL is a resource.  It should also be noted that a \nclient also has to be authorized to access a resource.  So, even if a \nresource is identified by a URL, the client may not have permission to \nread/write it.\n&gt; * Clients use HTTP GET to retrieve a useful Representation of that \n&gt; Resource\nGot it.\n&gt; * Client requests should *only* depend on (and affect) the Resources \n&gt; explicitly listed\nWhat does it mean for a request to &quot;depend&quot; on something?  I think you \nmean that the result of a request is functionally dependent on the \ncontent of the request and the state of the resource.\n\nBut &quot;resource&quot; is a fuzzy boundary.  If I retrieve a page with \ninformation about a book, and that page includes the current date at the \ntop, is that un-RESTful, because that date was the resource I was \nrequesting, and is not accessible by a separate URL?\n&gt; To be sure, there are &quot;dynamic&quot; resources which are changed as a side \n&gt; effect, e.g. &quot;cgi/last-modified&quot;.  But, that Resource is expected to \n&gt; change unpredictably, and should presumably indicate as much in its \n&gt; headers, so that proxy servers et al can respond appropriately.\nI&#39;m unfamiliar with what you&#39;re saying.  Are you talking about a \nresource like &quot;http://www.example.com/cgi/lat-modified&quot;?  What would \nthat represent?  The last time the &quot;cgi&quot; folder was modified?\n&gt; From this perspective, Cookies are bad to the extent that they move \n&gt; server state *outside* the explicit naming hierarchy of URLs, and thus \n&gt; outside the usual ecosystem of servers and proxies.  Yeah, it works, \n&gt; but its a bit of a kludge; I suspect that -- with what we know now -- \n&gt; we would&#39;ve been able to design something that better fits the \n&gt; existing architecture of the web.\n&gt;\nI think I see what you are saying.  The server state to which the cookie \nrefers has no corresponding URL.  Perhaps the cookies would be OK, if \nyou could also access them by URL, e.g. \n&quot;http://www.example.com/cookies/AFK234lkjsD&quot;.\n&gt; At least thats my understanding. I&#39;m sure Roy himself weight in soon \n&gt; if we completely mis-Represent him. :-)\n&gt;\nThanks.\n\n-- \nLyle Kopnicky\nSoftware Project Engineer\nVeicon Technology, Inc.\n\n\n"}}
