May I summarize how it looks from\n&gt; here:\n&gt;\n&gt; HTTP GET, PUT, DELETE, and even POST realize uniform semantics. POST\n&gt; doesn&#39;t constrain the semantics very much, because the server can do a\n&gt; lot of things with the posted message. But ordinary HTTP clients don&#39;t\n&gt; assume anything more than that the result of the POST may be available\n&gt; in the returned entity or at the URI specified in the Location header.\n&gt;\n&gt; HTTP permits a certain class of client applications to operate against\n&gt; arbitrary servers in exactly the same way. When those clients POST, \n&gt; they\n&gt; would not presume that the server will return the Location of query\n&gt; results. They might, however, retrieve the representation from the 201\n&gt; created Location, should the server return that, and render it for the\n&gt; user. They could not process the response more intelligently than that.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you write a client application that presumes the resource returned \n&gt; in\n&gt; the Location header is a query result, and attempt to do further\n&gt; processing based on that presumption, your client will fail against\n&gt; arbitrary resources. Or rather, the server may happily respond with 200\n&gt; or 201 but your client will have to further process the response to\n&gt; determine whether the invocation really succeeded, before processing it\n&gt; as a query result.\n\nGood summary, but it should be clear that if such were true, it would\nbe unnecessary for REST to include the concept of hypertext as the\nengine of application state.  The above completely ignores the role\nof representations in determining the available set of actions,\nand describing their semantics, such that the user agent can know\nhow to interact with the identified resources.\n\nThe fact that an occasional in-line image request doesn&#39;t actually\nresult in an image typed representation is an error, but one that\nis easily detected by the client.  We would never consider disallowing\nsuch requests simply because the resource might not correspond to what\nthe browser expects.  The notion that REST-based user agents can&#39;t\nhave expectations of a resource is clearly false.\n\n&gt; Mark suggests a new interface, adding the QUERY-WITH-POST method to the\n&gt; usual HTTP methods. If you want to write a client that can operate\n&gt; against arbitrary resources, and presume the response will be a query\n&gt; result it can process, you would have to use that new method. If the\n&gt; server responds 200 or 201 in that case, you can process the response \n&gt; as\n&gt; a query. This interface exposes uniform semantics to all such clients.\n&gt; This approach seems the most robust way for Bud (the original poster on\n&gt; the thread) to implement his query.\n\nExcept that it has nothing to do with REST.  REST would say that the\n200 response can be processed however the client likes.  A 201 response,\nhowever, says that a new resource has been created as a result of\nprocessing the request -- a client will always use GET on that new\nresource and may process it however the client wants, provided that\nit understands the media type.  The client does not need anyone&#39;s\npermission to go from one state to the next.\n\nUsing a different method has no value here because the total semantics\nof the original request is &quot;process this&quot;.  GET would be a better\nchoice if the query is amenable to being translated into a URI, but\nwhen it is not there is no harm in using POST.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
