No  \nother email list I&#39;m subscribing to is this troublesome, and I&#39;m  \nsubscribed to quite a lot.\n\n\nI keep getting &quot;Your messages are bouncing&quot; notices unsubscribing me  \nfrom the group, but when visiting the &quot;bouncer&quot; page it doesn&#39;t tell  \nme which messages are bouncing (just a message number), so it&#39;s  \ndifficult for me to report this on to my email administrators. (those  \nmessages bounce because they get too high a spam score).\n\n\nHalf of the messages to the list contains quoted HTML with menu items  \nintended for the original recipient (&quot;Visit your group&quot; etc).  (even  \nif I&#39;ve set my format to &quot;Traditional&quot; - the problem is that not  \neveryone is on traditional, and when they reply they include the menus)\n\n\nThe web accessible archive I can understand gave some added value at  \nsome point, but these days the interface just feels extremely slow  \nand horrible to use compared to say Google groups, it doesn&#39;t even  \nunderstand threading properly.\n\n\nWhen people try to include code examples of XML/Java/Python their  \nindention is messed up, making the examples unreadable, and I think  \nthis is quite an important feature on a technical email list.\n\n\nWhy was Yahoo groups chosen for the REST discussions? Is it possible  \nto review that choice?\n\n\n-- \nStian Soiland\n\n\n\n\n"}}
