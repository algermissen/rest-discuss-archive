Mo&#39;bettah to have 1,000 folks work together to standardize new\ngeneric types which address general deficiencies from the m2m\nperspective, than to let 1,000 new custom types bloom.  The latter\nclearly goes against the whole point of REST, which is all about the\nbenefits of the former (network-based shared understanding).\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
