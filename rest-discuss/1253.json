Does anyone have any Java implementation\n&gt; experience to share?\n\nMake the point that EVERY web application development tool (Servlets,\nZope, WebLogic) has a strong RESTful component.\n\n&gt; 2) The SOAP proponents at work are proposing the use of Apache Axis\n&gt; as a SOAP server implementation. Does anyone have experience with\n&gt; Axis?\n\nNot really. I know Google used it. They reported success but at the same\ntime said they had to hack it to support all of their potential client\nlibraries.\n\n&gt; 3) The SOAP proponents think the extensible SOAP header adds\n&gt; flexibility, a place to put transaction metadata or security related\n&gt; information. Does REST have an answer to these requirements?\n\nAs Mark said: HTTP headers. But also XML itself is extensible whether\nyou use SOAP or not.\n\n&gt; 4) We need a way for an external application to store or modify a\n&gt; trade in our application. I would be interested in any feedback on\n&gt; the following resource modeling ideas:\n&gt; \n&gt; 4a) To store a new trade, either a two step communication:\n&gt;  -&gt; HTTP GET request\n&gt;       to //host/trades/newtradeuri\n&gt;       or //host/trades?newtradeuri\n\nBad, because non-idempotent GET.\n\n&gt;..\n&gt; Or perhaps do it in one step:\n&gt;  -&gt; HTTP POST request containing trade XML\n&gt;       to //host/trades/newtrade\n&gt;       or //host/trades\n&gt; \n&gt;  &lt;- HTTP response would contain server-generated URI:\n&gt;          //host/trades/123\n\nGreat!\n\n&gt;....\n&gt; 5) Given the requirements outlined in (4), which would you recommend:\n&gt; the REST approach above, or the use of SOAP with an API containing\n&gt; methods such as, storeTrade(tradeXml), modifyTrade(tradeXml), getTrade\n&gt; ().\n\nSounds like a perfect REST application to me! If you need consulting to\nhelp convince them I&#39;ll halve my normal rate. ;)\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
