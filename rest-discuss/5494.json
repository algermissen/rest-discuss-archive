API at a Web2.0 mini conference recently. Now, I like\nthe concept very much, and would like to start following it, and have the\nfollowing questions:\n\n- Are there any reasonably good PHP/Apache based REST solutions that you\nknow of? I&#39;ve read one tutorial based on Rails/Apache, which shouldn&#39;t be\ntoo hard to carry over, but why re-invent the wheel, if someone else, who\nprobably knows better about the concept than me, offers a solution.\n\n- What&#39;s your thoughts on REST in combination with Ajax? I mean, Ajax\nrequests XML, xmlhttprequest supports GET/POST/PUT/DELETE, REST takes and\ndelivers XML, and with a little bit of server trickery you can connect to\nany REST webservice you like. I had a little search in this lists archive\nand didn&#39;t find much.\n\n- I came across the idea of content negotiation, how does that work? I\nunderstand that depending on whatever the outcome of that negotiation is,\nthe webservice would deliver XML or XHTML. Is that reliable? Would Apache\njust check for &quot;Accept: text/html&quot; and deliver XHTML? (and, maybe a bit\noff-topic, how would I get bloody xmlhttprequest to send a different\nheader?)\n\nLots of questions, and I&#39;m happy if you could help me with some of them.\n\nCheers,\nMatthias\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
