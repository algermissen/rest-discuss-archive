Bowman &lt;eric@...&gt;\n\n&gt;\n&gt; No. REST absolutely requires self-descriptive messaging. Roy again:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Self-descriptive means that the type is registered and the registry\n&gt; points to a specification and the specification explains how to process\n&gt; the data according to its intent.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; If there&#39;s no other registry on the Web but IANA, how can any\n&gt; identifier not IANA-registered be in a registry, and therefore self-\n&gt; descriptive?\n&gt;\n&gt;\nNo, let me also quote Roy:\n\n&quot;Self-descriptive means that the type is registered and the registry\npoints to a specification and the specification explains how to process\nthe data according to its intent.&quot;\n\nNothing in Roy quote says that registry MUST be IANA.\n\nBoth RFC2046 and RFC4288 clearly say that there are IANA unregistered types\nthat start with X-\n\nThere&#39;s nowhere nothing to prevent thos X- types to be registered privatly.\n\nSo, if I register in my company the X-media-types I want and all the\ninterested parties agree with that, I have a registry that points to a\nspecification and the specification explains how to process the data\naccording to its intent. So I have self-descriptive media-types not\nregistered with IANA.\n\nIf you&#39;re going again to talk about the intermediaries and the slogans\n&quot;serendipity&quot;, &quot;anarchic-scaling&quot; and the like, let me remember that none of\nthose are *constraints* of a REST system. The only constraint that are\nrelated to the intermediaries is cache - and that is obtained by having the\nintermediaries treating\n\napplication/x.mytopic+xml\n\nas if it was\n\napplication/xml\nPlease note that things like pre-caching, accelarators and other features of\nintermediaries *are not* REST constraints, cache is.\n\nAlso, if you&#39;re going to object with what you called &quot;collisions&quot;, it is\ntrue that they can happen with regular, non-X-types if they are not\nregistered in IANA, but that won&#39;t happen if they are of X-type. Because the\nregistration of a X-type outside IANA assumes the pre-agreement between the\ninterested parties, so if they agree to use them they also know where they\nare registered. So, the only collision that couls eventually happen is on\nintermediaries, but if you&#39;re using a X-type that won&#39;t happen either\nbecause they will treat application/x.mytopic+xml as if it was\napplication/xml.\n\nAlso, if you&#39;re invoking the &quot;everibody&quot; or &quot;anybody&quot; argument, please let\nme state again that the Web is as much about &quot;everibody&quot; or &quot;anybody&quot; as is,\nlike Roy, RFC2046 and RFC4288 says, about &quot;participants in the\ncommunication&quot; (Roy), &quot;consenting systems&quot;(RFC2046) and &quot;parties exchanging&quot;\n(RFC4288).\n\nI hope you don;t feel that RFC are important for some things and not for the\nothers.\n\nFinnally, let me say also that I found very strange that you think that are\nsome REST/HTTP rules for the internet and others for the intanets, when\ntheir architecture is the same.\n\r\n--00163630ece502fd9d048fe9ff26\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;2010/9/10 Eric J.
