If what you want to accomplish\n&gt;     P&gt; is semantically equivalent to a PUT or DELETE then why not use\n&gt;     P&gt; the standardized method for doing it?\n&gt;\n&gt; Can I ask a really naiive question?  I&#39;ve thought about this, but I&#39;ve\n&gt; never found any method to actually implement this; is there something\n&gt; I should know about browsers?\n\nMost browsers aren&#39;t going to make it easy. Most of the discussion - at\nleast for me - is about non-browser systems. An &#39;automatable Web&#39; as it\nwere.\n\nIn any case, the ideal would be to use HTML FORM element. But that is\ndisallowed (so I suppose HTML is non-RESTful):\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.1\n===\nThe method attribute of the FORM element specifies the HTTP method used to\nsend the form to the processing agent. This attribute may take two values:\n  a.. get: With the HTTP &quot;get&quot; method, the form data set is appended to the\nURI specified by the action attribute (with a question-mark (&quot;?&quot;) as\nseparator) and this new URI is sent to the processing agent.\n  b.. post: With the HTTP &quot;post&quot; method, the form data set is included in\nthe body of the form and sent to the processing agent.\n===\n\nHere is what it /could/ have looked like.\n&lt;FORM method=&#39;DELETE&#39; action=&#39;reports.asp?report=99&annotation=27&#39;&gt;\n&lt;input type=&#39;submit&#39; value=&#39; Delete this comment &#39;&gt;\n&lt;/FORM&gt;\n\n\nThe legal workaround would be to use client-side programming via JavaScript\n& some component. On IE you could use the XMLHTTPRequest object.\n\n&lt;script&gt;\nfunction doDeleteComment(form,reportId,annotationId)\n{\n    // this ProgID request MSXML4.dll installed - use a different one to\nwork with older XML DLLs.\n    var http = new ActiveXObject(&quot;Msxml2.XMLHTTP.4.0&quot;);\n    var url;\n\n    url = &quot;reports.asp?report=&quot;+reportId+&quot;&annotation=&quot;+annotationId;\n    http.open(&quot;DELETE&quot;,url,false,username,password);\n    http.send();\n\n    // debugging code...\n    alert(http.status + &quot; &quot; + http.statusText + &quot;&#92;n&quot; + http.responseText);\n\n    return false;    // prevents page from refreshing\n}\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;FORM method=&#39;DELETE&#39; action=&#39;reports.asp?report=99&annotation=27&#39;\nonSubmit=&#39;return doDeleteComment(this,99,27);&#39;&gt;\n&lt;input type=&#39;submit&#39; value=&#39; Delete this comment &#39;&gt;\n&lt;/FORM&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
