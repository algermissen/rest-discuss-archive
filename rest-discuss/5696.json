Assuming that users can put documents at any location is\n&gt; unrealistic, many users have only a certain path prefix delegated to\n&gt; them eg: /~user/index.html\n&gt;\n&gt; It has a feeling of land grab by standard committee too. I don&#39;t like\n&gt; the idea that the W3C or whoever can suddenly tell me,\n&gt; retrospectively, that I can&#39;t put files in certain locations because\n&gt; those locations now have a special meaning.\n&gt;\n&gt; Some of the proposed solutions that I can remember were:\n&gt;\n&gt; * Use the MGET method to get metadata about a URL, which could contain\n&gt; pointers to appropriate locations.\n&gt;\n&gt; * Use Link headers in response to HEAD or GET.\n&gt;\n&gt; * Use link constructs in the representation, eg HTML &lt;link&gt; elements.\n&gt;\n&gt; * A quirky DNS lookup thing, that I&#39;ve forgotten the name of.\n\nI think content neg could contribute to solving this; eg: for\nrobots.txt:\n\nGET / HTTP/1.1\nHost: someplace.com\nAccept: robot/robot\n\nI think that would work for p3p and most other meta data requirements\nas well.\n\n\nAs for the favicon,  I never understood why that wasn&#39;t an HTML LINK\ntype.\n\n\nNic Ferrier\n\n"}}
