Indeed, I find it impossible to see how\n&gt; we cannot have partial PUTs allowed.\n&gt;\n&gt; When we put we transfer *a* representation of the resource from client\n&gt; to server, just like when we GET we transfer *a* representation of the\n&gt; resource from server to client.\n&gt;\n&gt; Since a resource can have more than one representation, and we can only\n&gt; ever PUT one representation, any PUT is potentially affecting an\n&gt; innumerable number of representations as these may all depend on the\n&gt; server&#39;s knowledge of the resource - which we have just changed.\n&gt;\n&gt; All PUTs are therefore partial in this way.\n&gt;\n&gt; Following from that there is no reason why one may not send a\n&gt; representation that omits some information (it is indeed very common for\n&gt; one representation of a resource to contain information another does\n&gt; not). There is nothing faulty with such a representation and therefore\n&gt; no reason why it may not be used.\n&gt;\n&gt; Therefore whether partial PUTs may or may not be used becomes solely a\n&gt; matter of whether partial knowledge of a representation may be expressed\n&gt; in a particular content type.\n&gt;\n&gt; One can also do partial PUTs using content-range but this either\n&gt; requires either the entity to be of a type where over-writing a fixed\n&gt; number of octets makes sense, or else the use of a custom range-unit.\n\nHmmm ... &quot;PUT and The Art of HTTP&quot;\n\nIf there is a representation that completely describes the resource,\nthen a PUT will be complete. An example might be a PUT of a text/html\ndocument.\n\nHowever, as Jon rightly points out, some representations are a subset\nof the resource, and so (by implication) even though the PUT is\n&#39;representation complete&#39; it is not &#39;resource complete&#39;. An example\nmight be a PUT to a system that supports resource metadata with an\nalternate representation format.\n\nRegards,\nAlan Dean\nhttp://thoughtpad.net/alan-dean\n\n"}}
