Whether or not this means that you can&#39;t build it in a RESTful fashion\n&gt; depends on how literally you want to interpret certain utterings of e.g. TBL. ;-)\n\nOk.  So idempotence is a red herring.  My general\njudgement of this is that I think you shouldn&#39;t\nrely on idempotence.  Every things should be\ninterpreted as a once-off (otherwise known as\nlinear types -- see\nhttp://linux.rice.edu/~rahul/hbaker/Use1Var.html)\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t, however, think this means that you have to ditch resource modeling (rather\n&gt; than procedural API exposure) or the HTTP protocol.  It just means you have to\n&gt; think about how to do it within the framework provided.\n\nOk.  I guess I&#39;m just not getting how posting two\nimages to a URL is resource modeling.\n\n&gt; There&#39;s no reason why the thing that checks terrorists can&#39;t be reified as a\n&gt; resource with a generic interface that obeys the semantics of HTTP methods.\n\nOk.  But that is true of every RPC server as well.\nYou send arguments to the server and it sends back\na result.\n\nSuppose there was another argument, that had one\nof two values: isTerrorist | isFed\n\nWould that make it non-Restful?\n\n&gt; Your *next* objection will be that polling is undesirable.  Well, that&#39;s certainly\n&gt; true.  Asynchrony of requests and responses from the perspective of a particular\n&gt; application is often desirable.  That&#39;s what we&#39;ve been talking about:  different\n&gt; mechanisms to build asynchronous communication patterns atop HTTP without breaking\n&gt; the semantics of HTTP.\n\nI don&#39;t understand why SMTP doesn&#39;t do what you\nwant.  In particular SMTP doesn&#39;t look all that\ndifferent than HTTP with some new methods (MAIL,\nRCPT, VRFY, etc.).  What do you get from replacing\nSMTP?\n\nIf the point is simply that you want HTTP clients\nto me able to talk to mail servers, why not simply\ndo the direct mapping described above?\n\n&gt; Your next objection will be that HTTP is unreliable (as in guaranteed delivery.)\n&gt; That&#39;s true.  But them&#39;s the hard facts, main.  If you really believe that our SMTP\n&gt; fabric is reliable in that sense, I want some of what you&#39;re smoking. ;-)\n\nHTTP is inherently unreliable.  SMTP is only in\npractice unreliable because the implementations\nsuck.  Talk to the folks at ironport about this.\nIf you want to know more.\n\n&gt; In any\n&gt; case, there&#39;s no reason to believe either is or can be absolutely more reliable\n&gt; than the other.  The main objection to duplicating SMTP&#39;s messaging functionality\n&gt; in HTTP is that it&#39;s redundant;  the best argument for it is that it unifies the\n&gt; space of addressable things and their interfaces, and that has positive\n&gt; implications for integration and Metcalfe-value.\n\nOk.  So the big bonus here is that my email\naddress is http://i2x.com/~alex rather than\nalex@....  GETting this URL would retrieve my\nhomepage or some form of status information and\nPOSTing to it would send me an email.\n\nInteresting, but I guess I just don&#39;t see so much\nvalue there.\n\n&gt; Per reliable ordered delivery, that&#39;s a Hard Problem in a distributed setting ---\n\nseparate issue.\n\n&gt; Bottom line, you&#39;ve been offered a variety of solutions, etc. to your\n&gt; &quot;terrorist-or-not&quot; problem and related issues;  whether you accept them is up to\n&gt; you.\n\nThey are all fine.  What I fail to get is what\nexactly you don&#39;t like about RPC.\n\n&gt;  I still haven&#39;t seen any single point you&#39;ve raised that addresses Mark\n&gt; Baker&#39;s fundamental challenge, which is\n&gt;\n&gt;    &quot;Show me an application that I can&#39;t do with HTTP.&quot;\n\nI answered this before.  My answer was show me\nan application that you can&#39;t do with SMTP.\nYou should use what makes you feel comfortable and\nmodel applications as messages sent between agents\n:-).\n\nAnd, you&#39;re right, transactional stuff is another\nanswer.  You don&#39;t really want to use HTTP to\ninteract with Oracle.\n\n-Alex-\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
