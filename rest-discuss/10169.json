For example, you could do  \nan order state change - let&#39;s say it goes from &quot;submitted&quot; to  \n&quot;shipped&quot; - by either doing a PUT to update the state, or a POST to  \ncreate a sub-resource (which has the benefit of creating an audit  \ntrail).\n\nSo e.g. I could do\n\nPOST /orders/4711/states\n&lt;shipped&gt;...&lt;/shipped&gt;\n\nand get back a Location of a state notification; the order itself  \nwould reflect the change as well (nothing prevents you from changing  \nresources other than the one specified in the URI). Alternatively, I  \ncould move the resource from one collection to another (discussed a  \nwhile back here).\n\nStefan\n--\nStefan Tilkov, http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/\n\n"}}
