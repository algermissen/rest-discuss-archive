And\n&gt; you probably want to give a *person* a clue about what&#39;s wrong -- the person\n&gt; might be an end-user that another application displays an error message to,\n&gt; or it might be a developer who pours thru error logs or runs debuggers to\n&gt; figure out what went wrong.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, when I&#39;m doing this, I always include a description of the error in the\n&gt; response body, typically just plain ol&#39; HTML that can end up displayed to a\n&gt; user. I can certainly imagine providing a smarter, machine-readable\n&gt; description for some remote non-human agent, but I haven&#39;t seen that in\n&gt; action.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Lee\n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;   From: Lucas Gonze\n&gt;   To: Walden Mathews\n&gt;   Cc: lucas@... ; rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;   Sent: Saturday, May 22, 2004 8:00 AM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] error numbers\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   Well, see, that&#39;s exactly why I&#39;m frustrated here -- 4xx is for client\n&gt;   errors, but there aren&#39;t any 4xx status codes that express that meaning.\n&gt;\n&gt;   On Sat, 22 May 2004, Walden Mathews wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Bad values in form arguments is client error: 4xx.\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;   &gt; From: &quot;Lucas Gonze&quot; &lt;lgonze@...&gt;\n&gt;   &gt; To: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Sent: Friday, May 21, 2004 5:20 PM\n&gt;   &gt; Subject: [rest-discuss] error numbers\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; :\n&gt;   &gt; : I&#39;m building a restful api, and am finding that the response error\n&gt; codes\n&gt;   &gt; : are all specific to http aspects of the transaction.
