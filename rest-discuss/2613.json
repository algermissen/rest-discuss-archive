Idempotency is only limited to the resource on\n&gt; the server. Regardless of what is returned to the client, the\n&gt; operation on the server is idempotent (assuming that the end state is\n&gt; the same after repeated identical requests).\n\nThis would also be my conclusion, but for one thing.\n\nIf we take this interpretation of idempotence, then RFC 2616&#39;s \ndiscussion of non-idempotent sequences of idempotent methods makes no \nsense at all, because on this interpretation *all* sequences of \nidempotent methods are idempotent sequences: see the proof I gave \nearlier ... which I&#39;m confident that Walden&#39;s model, if he puts it \ntogether, will verify.\n\nCheers,\n\n\nMiles\n\n"}}
