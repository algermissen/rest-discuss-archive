I guess this is an application-level decision.  You\nmay choose to do put the URI in a header, or you could put the URI in the\ncontent, or you may even wrap the URI inside of XML in the content.\nPersonally, I would go with the second option (mostly since that is how I\nthink of the format/layout of a POST).\n\n&gt; this also raises another issue; now the issuer needs to &#39;own&#39; a HTTP\n&gt; server where they didn&#39;t before.\n\nI would rather say &quot;now each party needs to &#39;own&#39; a HTTP server&quot;.  I see\nthis as no different than each party needing to own a phone.  Fortunately,\nwith the proliferation of inexpensive and dependable ASPs, this is not as\nmuch an issue as it used to be.\n\n&gt; one more point: because there are more resources involved i think it may\n&gt; take a while longer to &#39;grok&#39; this resource model if you were trying to\n&gt; explain it to somebody.  from a pedagogical perspective, i think maybe\n&gt; it would be better to show a simpler version first, point out the\n&gt; ambiguity, and then show this as a &#39;refinement&#39; of the simpler one.\n\nCertainly.  I think part of the reason that this may be more difficult to\ngrasp is that this requires thinking about URIs in a more REST-like manner,\nwhich it seems that most people using the web do not.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; either way, thanks for sharing the model; it&#39;s certainly food for thought.\n\nOf course, I don&#39;t see this model applying to all RESTful applications (not\nyet, anyhow).  The main reason for this is that, as you point out above,\nthis requires server-to-server interaction.  And while that may be\nincreasingly possible for the business sector, the consumer sector is still\na bit of a ways off from having always-on, broadband, static IP connections\nwith HTTP servers sitting at the end of them.  :)\n\nHowever, it may be possible to work around this problem with a hybrid\nsystem, where individuals follow a client-server model with an HTTP server\nthey have access to, then the server itself uses the peer-to-peer model\n(passing around URIs as discussed in the original post) with remote servers.\nFor instance, I may have access to the following server/URI space:\n\n    http://www.seairth.com/users/seairth/\n\nI have near unrestricted access to use PUT, POST, GET, etc to any URI within\nthat space.  I may install and map a messaging system to:\n\n    http://www.seairth.com/users/seairth/message/\n\n I would then be able to PUT messages there (since I have &#39;absolute&#39; control\nof that space).  For instance:\n\n    PUT http://www.seairth.com/users/seairth/message/out/12345\n\nThe internal messaging system would then turn around and POST the URI for\nthat message to the remote HTTP server of the user I am &#39;sending&#39; the\nmessage to (as discussed in the original post):\n\n    POST http://www.seairth.com/users/sjacobs/messages/in\n\nIn turn, the remote user would query their own server using GET:\n\n    GET http://www.seairth.com/users/sjacobs/messages/in\n\nwhich would return to them a list of new messages including my original URI.\nThey would then be able to directly access the message on my server using\nthe above URI.  All of the resources would stay &#39;local&#39;.  Then, when Bob\nHaugen had realized that he forgot RosettaNet in [1], he would have been\nable to do the PUT to correct it instead of posting [2].\n\n[1] http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/1990\n[2] http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/1991\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n\n\n"}}
