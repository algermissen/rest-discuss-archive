There is no way in \n&gt; a typical SOA system to pass references to objects around, while REST \n&gt; is all about passing around individual instances of resources via URI.\n&gt; That is a big difference.\n\nI claim this is a big deal because where a service-oriented interface \ntends to combine a bunch of separate things into one interface, REST \ntends to push towards very componentized resources.\n\nThis helps interoperability because it means that if you and I can agree \non the syntax for a purchase order across two domains we don&#39;t ALSO have \nto agree on (for example) the API for querying purchase orders (which \nmight be different because different people have different querying \nneeds), or even fetching purchase orders (because it is hard coded to be \nGET).\n\nI predict that there will be a movement against monolithic interfaces in \na few years, REST or not. It is very reminicent of the Windows 3.1 API, \nwhere the first function parameter is a handle for the thing you&#39;re \nsupposed to work on. Only problem is...there is no way to pass a handle \nto data+methods which is the essence of OOP.\n\nIs anyone brave enough to stand up for monolithic services? ;) Even as a \ndevil&#39;s advocate?\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
