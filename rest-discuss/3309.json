I agree!  The\n&gt; Meta-Locatio=\r\nn header provides the URL to the service&#39;s authoritative\n&gt; service descript=\r\nion.\n\nInstead of introducing a new header for this, couldn&#39;t you just stick=\r\n \nwith the standard OPTIONS method? If you have one authoritative bit of \nm=\r\netadata that you want to keep in a separate document, respond with \na &quot;303 =\r\nSee Other&quot;; and if there are multiple documents, that could turn \naround an=\r\n respond with either Content-Type specific documents, and/or\nfor\nfiner grai=\r\nned control, a &quot;300 Multiple Choices.&quot;\n\nSince any tool that would be lookin=\r\ng for a custom header would need to\nbe written with that in mind, it would =\r\nbe just as easy for it to \ncall the OPTIONS method and deal with the result=\r\ns appropriately.\n\n&gt;&gt; Other\n&gt;&gt; metadata, like making claims &#39;about&#39; the reso=\r\nurce (asserting that it\nis a\n&gt;&gt; member of some topic/subject/concept/etc.) =\r\nbenefits from being\nexternal and\n&gt;&gt; having multiple sources to varying trus=\r\nt.\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s more than that. Suppose that my shop is running RDF engines to\n=\r\n&gt; enable inductive reasoning, and suppose that the Web service that my\n&gt; co=\r\nmpany wants to use just provides an XHTML description.  Thus, my\n&gt; company =\r\ncreates an RDF description of the Web service - it tells the\nHOW\n&gt; of how t=\r\nhe use it, and it does it using RDF.  Thus, my company&#39;s RDF\n&gt; description =\r\nadds value to the Web service, and it does it in a\n&gt; distributed fashion. /=\r\nRoger\n\nIf a time comes when search engines are able to parse and understand=\r\n\nsemantically marked up documents, wouldn&#39;t it be easier to just have\na lin=\r\nk to the service right in the document itself instead of\nintroducing\na cust=\r\nom header?  Google is all about looking a links already.\n\n- Jeff\n\n"}}
