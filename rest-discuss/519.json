If you are doing this, then you should allow\nnotification messages to specify alternative\nservers (preemptive redirect).\n\n&gt; I guess I&#39;ll take it out and see if a need for it arises. My main\n&gt; concern is that while you are retrying one event you don&#39;t want to build\n&gt; up a larger and larger queue of events you are retrying for the same\n&gt; missing subscriber until you start to interfere with network\n&gt; performance.\n\nIf the client misses notifications, that is OK.\nWhy not just drop them?\n\n&gt; &gt; (4) It might be useful to require an appropriate validator\n&gt; &gt; (entity tag or last-modified header) in every notification.\n&gt;\n&gt; Require is a little strong. Remember that part of the genious of HTTP is\n&gt; that basic implementations are so simple. MUST&#39;s start raising the bar.\n&gt;\n&gt; Maybe it is a feature that clients may ask for along with minimized\n&gt; notification bodies and whatever else we come up with.\n\nPaul, this thing should be really easy to\nimplement.\nThe pure URI version with message dropping allowed\nmeans that each time a watched resource is changed\nit just iterates through a notification list\nissuing ___ requests with no content.\n\nI think this gets you almost everything you want.\n\nAdding all sorts of negotiation seems annoying.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
