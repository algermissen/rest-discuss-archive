But that&#39;s not what\n&gt; it&#39;s intended to do.\n\nWell, can I, or can&#39;t I? Sounds to me like I can. So, I have a &#39;subject&#39; \ncontext. However, as I stated at the very outset, the &#39;user&#39; is not \nsufficient context if users need to modify server state in the context \nof a session. So, if I needed to model a session, how could I do it?\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;The table containing session 42s data held at the server.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;So, if I put &#39;Session 42&#39; in the URL this would somehow be different?\n&gt; \n&gt; If the url could be used to retrieve the content of the resource\n&gt; (including the entire session state) then yes, I think it would.\n\nYou mean,\n\n  Session 42 GETs /session-state\n\n:)\n\nI suppose you mean,\n\n  GET /session-state?session=42\n\nWhy is it that you think there is any difference whether the session \ncontext is in the URL or in a cookie? You&#39;ve conceded the point that a \nsession context (albeit only one universal session per user) is possible \nwith HTTP Auth. Why can&#39;t I use some other header? Like, say, a cookie \nheader?\n\nCould you perhaps offer an argument for your position, as opposed to \nmere contradiction?\n\nFor example, I would argue that the value in separating the &#39;subject&#39; \nand the &#39;object&#39; of the request is that from a user&#39;s perspective the \nsubject is always implicit. That is, a user, while using my web \napplication, isn&#39;t really cognisant of the fact that the system has been \ndesigned for many users. They see the whole world through their own \neyes. They think they are the centre of the universe. When *they* do \nsomething it&#39;s pretty obvious to *them* that it&#39;s *them* who&#39;s doing it. \nFor this reason I don&#39;t expect users to need to realise that the URL \nthey have in their browser&#39;s address bar has been customised for them. \nThe URL is &#39;what&#39;, it&#39;s not &#39;what&#39;+&#39;who&#39;.\n\nHow often do you see users post the full link from their address bar to \na book on Amazon, for example? Amazon puts all that extra goop on the \nend of their URLs, and those numbers mean something (who knows what, \nexactly, but I&#39;ll bet &#39;session&#39; is one of them), and then users post \nthat all over Usenet, and don&#39;t have an idea of what they&#39;re telling.\n\nAs a courtesy and a convenience to my users, I&#39;d like the &#39;context&#39; \nwhich identifies them to be separate from the &#39;context&#39; that designates \n&#39;what&#39; they want. To the extent that representations of &#39;what&#39; they want \n(a resource) vary based on &#39;who&#39; they are, I don&#39;t expect them to worry \nabout that. I give them a customised service, they&#39;re happy.\n\nAs a result users can share links and bookmark links with reckless \nabandon. Also, owing to the way the web has worked out in practice, \nthere is a precedent for session tokens, and there is thus in many ways \na user expectation for them.\n\nAs an application developer receiving and processing HTTP requests, I \nfind it enormously valuable to isolate what is implied by the &#39;subject&#39;, \nand what is implied by the &#39;object&#39; separately. As I desire to separate \nthese concerns during processing, it seems more appropriate for me to \nensure that the URI (the &#39;resource&#39;, the &#39;what&#39;) is already exactly the \n&#39;object&#39; before I begin processing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
