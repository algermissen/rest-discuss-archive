So I \nrarely\n&gt; used them in the way you mentioned, since that required threads to \nbe\n&gt; managed.  I almost always just checked for a response.  \n\nWould it also be possible to make a Web resource into something like \na future?\n\nThe terms in this space are very overloaded, but call it a Commitment \n(in the speech act or REA sense, not in the database sense) or a \nPromise (related to but not quite the same as the E-Lang creature of \nthe same name)?\n\nThe speech act or REA meaning of Commitment is a promise to perform \nan event in the future.  When the event occurs, it fulfills the \npromise (or doesn&#39;t, as the case may be.)  A Commitment can have a \ntime constraint.\n\nThe implementation could be similar to Offer-Acceptance:  the \nCommitment has a URI to which the promisor POSTs the promised event.\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
