If two pieces of information have different permissions\nrelating to them then it should be because they are representations of two\ndifferent (if related) resources that in turn should have two different URIs.\n\nI don&#39;t think the inclusion or exclusion of sensitive data is comparable to the\nother reasons for content negotiation (content type, content language etc.).\n\nThe main reason for taking the approach of varying content per user in\ntraditional web applications is to offer a limited-view rendering rather than a\nfull-view-with-errors rendering. In the case of an application which is giving\na human user (or another process) a view onto information obtained from a web\nservice then it can do the necessary attempts to download restricted data and\nhence the limited-view pattern is possible by using several URIs.\n\nEven in the case of a browser-based web app using XSLT this would be possible if\nit were possible to trap errors with document() calls. Alas whether the errors\nare signalled or not is implementation-defined.\n\n-- \nJon Hanna\n&lt;http://www.hackcraft.net/&gt;\n&quot;ï¿½it has been truly said that hackers have even more words for\nequipment failures than Yiddish has for obnoxious people.&quot; - jargon.txt\n\n"}}
