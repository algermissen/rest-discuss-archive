What if a cache intercepts the method?\n&gt; \n&gt; GET doesn&#39;t have side-effects in that case.  The resource doesn&#39;t change\n&gt; state, plus any other stateful action are undone when the GET finishes.\n\nI don&#39;t follow you. If a GET tells a server to remember to contact me\nlater then how is that not a side-effect. It is a change of server-side\nstate (though not a change of the resource&#39;s state).\n\n&gt; &gt; What if a server just doesn&#39;t understand the header at all? It won&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; announce that.\n&gt; \n&gt; The &quot;Subscriber&quot; header?  Nope, it won&#39;t announce it, but that&#39;s part of\n&gt; the Subscription/Subscriber contract.  Why would somebody POST a message\n&gt; with a Subscriber body to a URI that didn&#39;t advertise its ability to\n&gt; accept it (and have it mean &quot;subscribe&quot;)?\n\nFirst: you shouldn&#39;t have to know a priori whether a resource is\nsubscribable. You should be able to ask it.\n\nSecond: having a resource do a completely different type of action based\non the contents of the entity body sounds like RPC to me!\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
