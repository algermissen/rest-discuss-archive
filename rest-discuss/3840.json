I don&#39;t see why WebDAV would be a special case here,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; so that sounds wrong too.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Could you please explain why you think this is wrong?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I just don&#39;t think that it is a WebDAV specific problem, so I would\n&gt;&gt; expect WebDAV to use whatever status would be appropriate for any\n&gt;&gt; other HTTP application.\n\nJR&gt; So you think this is wrong because WebDAV added a new status code? I can&#39;t\nJR&gt; agree -- the whole point of WebDAV is to *extend* HTTP/1.1 (with new\nJR&gt; methods, request headers...), and therefore adding a new specific 4xx status\nJR&gt; code because none of the existing ones fitted well seems to be absolutely\nJR&gt; right thing to do.\n\nI wasn&#39;t trying to pick on WebDAV. I have no problem with WebDAV\ninventing new codes. I was just trying to figure out what was the best\nstatus to return for a semantic error in HTTP, and WebDAV was a good\ncase study because it invents a new code for this purpose. If WebDAV\nhad to invent a new code, then does that mean that this is a situation\nthat HTTP/1.1 doesn&#39;t cater for?\n\nWhat I am really trying to figure out is whether 400 is allowed for\nrequests that are syntactically correct at the HTTP level, but have a\nsemantic error.  I always thought that it was OK, because it looks\nlike the most appropriate code.  I&#39;m assuming that WebDAV invented\n422, because it considered it not to be OK - but I don&#39;t really know\nthe history.\n\n\n\n-- \nBest regards,\n David                            mailto:djpowell@...\n\n\n"}}
