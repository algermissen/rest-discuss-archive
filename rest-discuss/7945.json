It has some very\n&gt; interesting characteristics that make it a good fit for various\n&gt; integration scenarios, amongst other things.\n&gt; \n&gt; Philosophically, it can almost be perceived as a simpler, easier,\n&gt; REST-\n&gt; oriented alternative to SOAP. We may finally have something to counter\n&gt; the \n&gt; dirtiness that is SOAP, since Atom can be a very good enveloping\n&gt; mechanism.\n\nHTTP is REST&#39;s current alternative to SOAP\n+enough-WSDL-to-make-SOAP-do-something-useful. Atom is more like REST&#39;s\n(someone&#39;s?) alternative to RDF. That is to say, it compliments a\ngrowing family of standard document types that can be included in each\nother, and can be extended for domain-specific uses without inventing a\nwhole new vocabulary.\n\nRDF builds an abstract metamodel and expects vocabularies to fill the\nrest of the gaps. Successful formats to date have taken a different\napproach of defining vocabulary and document structure together. XML\nappears to be a good tool in defining these document types. It allows\nother XML documents to be easily included as sub-documents. It allows\nexisting document types to be extended. Combined with mime, it even has\na means to be explicit about the extension. I might define an\nindustry-specific application/pids+atom+xml document type that could be\ninterpreted purely as atom, but also has special features and vocabulary\nthat can be handled by parsers aware of the relevant extensions.\n\nI see the aggregation and sub-classing features of XML as the core of\nthe semantic web going forwards. I think this is a more fully-featured\nway of representing data than rigid RDF. Perhaps my main concern going\nforwards is the modern propensity to try and replace MIME with URIs. If\nI have an xml uri of http://w3c.org/xml and want to subclass it my url\nwould likely look something like &lt;http://wrsa.com.au/something&gt;. In this\ncase it is difficult for parsers to know that they can treat my document\ntype as xml for the purpose of running xpath queries. I think mime and\nURIs both have their problems, but I think the problems with URIs are\nmore terminal when it comes to building a real semantic web.\n\nBenjamin.\n\n\n\n"}}
