It is\n&gt;         therefore not dependent upon the representation. eg. if I am\n&gt;         being shown an itinerary for my approval prior to a final\n&gt;         booking, I am in the state of reviewing the itinerary -\n&gt;         irrespective of whether the itinerary was being rendered as\n&gt;         XHTML, JSON, XML, PDF or PNG.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     I&#39;m not sure if I understand the distinction you make between\n&gt;     application and resource state\n&gt;\n&gt; XHTML / JSON formats are an attribute of the resource representation - \n&gt; they cannot be an attribute of the application state, since from an \n&gt; application perspective, the user is exactly at the same place in the \n&gt; overall workflow irrespective of the resource representation.\n\nThis seems to imply tight coupling between resource and application \nstate. I can&#39;t agree that these are the same states from an application \nperspective because they are clearly distinguished by control data in \nthe HTTP message (Accept/Content-Type in this specific case).\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;          \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;                b) How is a bookmark adequately defined ? This is really a\n&gt;                question for the author of a browser to answer. If we had a\n&gt;                browser which say allowed you to also describe the accept\n&gt;                headers before making the URI, then let us for a moment\n&gt;                suggest that such a browser the bookmark perhaps could\n&gt;         contain\n&gt;                the accept header. However we don&#39;t have such browsers (I\n&gt;                haven&#39;t seen one at least). But it is likely that\n&gt;         programmatic\n&gt;                clients may want to choose to store such URIs for say\n&gt;         resuming\n&gt;                later. Such a browser is again unlikely to &#39;break&#39; if it is\n&gt;                able to accept and parse various content types with equal\n&gt;                capability or works with only one content type which it\n&gt;         always\n&gt;                specifically requests. However it could break if in a\n&gt;                particular situation it has requested a particular resource\n&gt;                with a non default accept headers and that is specifically\n&gt;                needed to resume further. In such a situation, perhaps the\n&gt;                bookmark could store the accept header.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;            That is, essentially, what I was suggesting\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;         Yes, thats what I had assumed you were referring to - I was on\n&gt;         the other hand attempting to separate the notion of the\n&gt;         bookmark and the application state - ie. they are not one and\n&gt;         the same.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     If a bookmark is not a stored reference to a given application\n&gt;     state, what is it?\n&gt;\n&gt; In this context it is a stored reference to an application state + a \n&gt; preferred format.\n\nThe array of representations for a given resource are not application \nstates in their own right?\n\nHow would you model negotiating these formats in a state machine, \nwithout treating them as separate states?\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;                But even in this case the accept headers imo are not an\n&gt;                attribute of the application state - they are an\n&gt;         application\n&gt;                of the conversation state (though I am open to be\n&gt;         challenged\n&gt;                since I myself am not so terribly convinced about it).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;            I don&#39;t know if I understand what you mean by &#39;application\n&gt;         of the\n&gt;            conversation state&#39; - but there is no room for a state between\n&gt;            application and resource, given communication in RESTful\n&gt;         systems\n&gt;            is (supposed to be) stateless.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;         Sorry, made a mistake there - should&#39;ve stated &quot; the accept\n&gt;         headers imo are not an attribute of the application state -\n&gt;         they are an _*attribute*_ of the conversation state&quot;. Though\n&gt;         reading it again I feel a little lame. I should&#39;ve been more\n&gt;         specific and should&#39;ve said &quot;the accept headers imo are not an\n&gt;         attribute of the application state - they are merely the\n&gt;         influencers of a representation as a part of a given conversation&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     If they are influencing the representation transfered, they are\n&gt;     impacting on the application state. I can agree that there is no\n&gt;     difference between the resource state, but that is desired\n&gt;     behavior from negotiated representations of the same resource.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I would just suggest the following hypothetical scenario. If I \n&gt; received a XHTML version of my itinerary and it had a link to obtain a \n&gt; PDF version, and then I click it - would it mean that the I would do a \n&gt; state transition from one state to another or would it be from a state \n&gt; to itself.\n\nMy understanding is that you are describing an application state \ntransition, so I would say the former - as mentioned above this is \nclearly distinguished by the control data within each of the HTTP messages.\n\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n\n"}}
