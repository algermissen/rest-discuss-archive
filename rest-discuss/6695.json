You know: URIs not &#39;service endpoints&#39;.\n\nIf &#39;Object-Oriented web service&#39; means SOA, then you&#39;re about 10 years \nout of date and back to CORBA: most SOA-ites and Web Service-ites have \nlong given up the idea that it makes sense to map the object model onto \nthe distributed systems world. They kinda went back to RPC for a bit, \nand are now floating around the message-passing paradigm.\n\nSorry to be so destructive of your email.   =0/\n\nLet me try to be constructive - if they get the &#39;tactical&#39; advantages of \nREST over SOA, try selling them on the biggest strategic advantage of \nall: interoperability!  See all the voluminous literature on REST vs \nSOA(P) to back you up on this.\n\nOnce they get that, I would start to explain the benefits of declarative \nover imperative architectures - but that&#39;s my own crusade and I&#39;m \nstraying from REST orthodoxy a bit with that...  =0)\n\nGood luck!\n\nDuncan\n\n\n\n\n"}}
