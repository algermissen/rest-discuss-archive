If you want to\ncompare REST to GTP I&#39;d start there, especially with this bit:\n\n&quot;REST is defined by four interface constraints: identification of\nresources; manipulation of resources through representations;\nself-descriptive messages; and, hypermedia as the engine of application\nstate.&quot;\n\nI don&#39;t think it is easy to answer whether GTP is RESTful. To do so, I\nwould have to really understand it, almost as well as you do, and then\ntry to apply it mentally to a bunch of REST-architected systems and see\nwhether it handles them properly.\n-- \nCome discuss XML and REST web services at:\n  Open Source Conference: July 22-26, 2002, conferences.oreillynet.com\n  Extreme Markup: Aug 4-9, 2002,  www.extrememarkup.com/extreme/\n\n"}}
