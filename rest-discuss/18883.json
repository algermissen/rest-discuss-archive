From that point of view, I don&#39;t see \nthese things to be too bad. But generally indeed it seems these \nframeworks are built around a completely different idea, just \nconsidering the &quot;view&quot; approach in Spring MVC which, though not limited \nto that, still is pretty much centered around the idea of providing \n&quot;views&quot; in terms of user interaction, thus human-parseable HTML forms.\n\nYou can do way more with Spring MVC, but ultimately it boils down to \nthis, and this also is how tutorials seem to be crafted. This might be \ngood to those who already are knee-deep into HTTP while it might make \nthings difficult to others trying to start out right this.\n\nOne word on SOAP however, from my point of view: Yes, SOAP folks did \ndecide to just using HTTP as a transport protocol, which however, as far \nas I see things, is not a mistake but an actual design decision, and not \na bad one from my point of view. Maybe there are smart and sane use \ncases for both. :)\n\nCheers,\nK.\n\n"}}
