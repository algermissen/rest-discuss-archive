I had not made\naccommodations for getting ETags on empty responses. I now do as you\nsay - no conditional GETs when refreshing after POST/PUT.\n\nSecond, the POST response is a 201.  Since this server makes some\nalterations to the document body that was POSTed, I think a 205 would\nbe more appropriate.\n\nFinally, the server currently does not return a Location header. But\nthe server authors are aware of this and are adding the Location\nheader for both PUT and POST.\n\nMikeA\n\n\nOn Mon, Jul 28, 2008 at 10:36 AM, Brian Smith &lt;brian@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Mike Amundsen wrote:\n&gt;&gt; My initial code against this server was clearing the local\n&gt;&gt; cache on POST/PUT and then doing a GET request w/ the ETag\n&gt;&gt; and getting a 304 response from the remote server.  The end\n&gt;&gt; result is no body document for this URI in my local cache. To\n&gt;&gt; fix this, I changed my code to ignore the ETag returned on\n&gt;&gt; POST/PUT when attempting to update my local cache w/ a GET.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Was my initial code faulty?\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes. It doesn&#39;t make sense to do a conditional get when you want the server\n&gt; to return the response body unconditionally. In other words, don&#39;t make GET\n&gt; requests conditional when you have no entity for the resource in your cache.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Is returning an ETag in POST/PUT\n&gt;&gt; response w/ an empty body standard practice?\n&gt;\n&gt; Kinda. It depends on the response code, not just the method. If the ETag is\n&gt; returned in a &quot;201 Created&quot; response, then the ETag is for one of the\n&gt; representations of the resource referenced in the Location header field\n&gt; (but, a 201 response should have a body). See the definitions of the other\n&gt; status codes to see what ETag means for those kinds of responses. If nothing\n&gt; is mentioned for a particular status code, then the use of the ETag header\n&gt; is undefined for that response and the ETag should be ignored.\n&gt;\n&gt; Out of curiousity, what response code was the server returning?\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Brian\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\n\n"}}
