If you send email using this\nformat, an increasing number of clients will\nrecognize it.\n\nThe only remaining problem is replacing POP/IMAP.\nIt would be nice if mailclients could expose HTTP,\nbut often that is not possible.  My suggestion for\nretrieving new mail is again to use this header in\ncombination with multipart-byteranges.\n\nYou treat an INBOX (or newsgroup) as a\nmultipart/digest document.  Each message in the\ndigest should have an external-body.\n\nIf you want to see what has arrived since the\nlast time you checked, make a request with an\nif-modified-since: etag\n\nThe server then returns a multipart/byteranges\ndocument of all messages that have arrived since\nthat etag was generated.  The nice thing here is\nthat multipart/byteranges have the same syntax as\nmultipart/digest, so a client can just process the\nreturned data using any multipart handler.\n\n-Alex-\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
