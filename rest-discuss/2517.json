So REST is some kind of logical extension\n&gt; of the existing web, incorporating the ideals formed from lessons learned\n&gt; with the web.\n&gt; \n&gt; If REST were purely descriptive, this would be an odd discussion.  But we\n&gt; are attempting to use it prescriptively.  I interpret questions like &quot;does\n&gt; REST work?&quot; to mean &quot;does REST work prescriptively?&quot;.  I think everyone\n&gt; else does too.\n\nI don&#39;t attempt to use it prescriptively, though I know it probably\nlooks this way.  When that happens, it&#39;s because there is some desirable\nset of properties that I&#39;m trying to achieve, and I know that they can\nonly reasonably be had with some subset of REST&#39;s constraints.\n\nREST is most defintely *descriptive*.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
