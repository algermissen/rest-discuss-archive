We can then\n&gt;&gt; &gt; define Y as being a resource that is a count of the number of GET\n&gt;&gt; &gt; requests processed by Y.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Is this usage no longer RESTful?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As long as you don&#39;t depend on Y returning any particular value, sure \n&gt;&gt; it&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; RESTful, just like when you were using two separate resources above. The\n&gt;&gt; value returned by Y can only be used as a (very rough) approximation \n&gt;&gt; of how\n&gt;&gt; many GETs were made.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But frankly, you&#39;re better off treating GETs like pure functions.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; What does that mean and why are you better off that way?\n\nMy original answer was a bit smart-arsed, so here&#39;s what I really meant:\n\nNeither your original example or your second example were particularly RESTful\nbecause, in the context of HTTP, one of the constraints put upon GET is that\nit is idempotent and therefore a GET has _no significant_ side effects on the\nresource.\n\nThat&#39;s not to say that performing a GET on a resource _can&#39;t_ have\nside-effects, but those side-effects have to be such that if they went away\nthe application&#39;s functionality would not be changed. That&#39;s one of the\nprimary REST constraints in HTTP.\n\nOf course, there are big honking counterexamples on the web, the main one\nbeing hit counters. However, the way that hit counters use GET in a way that\nhas significant side-effects is a hack around the fact that you can&#39;t specify\nthat you want to fetch an image resource with POST, which would be much more\nappropriate.\n\nIf your example, both instances are RESTful if the incrementing is, say, a\nsecond order side-effect such as profiling, i.e., one which if removed doesn&#39;t\ndoes not affect the functionality of the application. However, if in both\ncases the side-effect is significant and affects the functionality of the\napplication, it ain&#39;t RESTful.\n\nK.\n\n-- \nBlacknight Internet Solutions Ltd. &lt;http://blacknight.ie/&gt;\nUnit 12A Barrowside Business Park, Sleaty Road, Graiguecullen, Carlow, Ireland\nCompany No.: 370845\n\n"}}
