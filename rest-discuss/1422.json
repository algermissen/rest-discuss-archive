This content is potentially served by a set of web servers\n&gt;&gt; running behind a HTTP load balancer.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; For a single server scenario, this seems pretty straightforward, At\n&gt;&gt; the client cache I track expected size [from the content-length\n&gt;&gt; header], Etag and last-modified. for subsequent requests I populate a\n&gt;&gt; If-None-Match header from the etag, a Range & Range-If header if the\n&gt;&gt; expected size is not the same as the cached file size, and i send a\n&gt;&gt; If-Modified-Since header if i don&#39;t have a Range header [my reading of\n&gt;&gt; the use of Range & Range-If lead me to believe to not use\n&gt;&gt; If-Modified-Since if i&#39;m using ranges].\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; My concern is when i have 2 or more web servers, all running behind a\n&gt;&gt; load balancer [local director etc], that each server will be assigning\n&gt;&gt; different etags to the same content (i don&#39;t see anything in the spec\n&gt;&gt; that lets me assume different server instances will generate the same\n&gt;&gt; etag for the same content, even for the same versions of HTTP server\n&gt;&gt; software). This is leading me to think about not using etags, and to\n&gt;&gt; just use the modified date, but then it doesn&#39;t look like you can do\n&gt;&gt; ranges with modified dates. Its also crossed my mind to use\n&gt;&gt; content-md5, but this doesn&#39;t seem very widely support [if at all].\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Any suggestions ?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thanks\n&gt;&gt; Simon\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Saturday, May 18, 2002, 1:50:51 PM, you wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I think it would be great if you asked the questions here.

I&#39;m\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; looking at using the HTTP/1.1 caching support (Etag, If-Modified-\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Since, If-None-Match and If-Range). I have some questions about how\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this works when deployed on a cluster of servers with a load\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; balancer, is this a good place to ask, or can someone recommend a\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; good list to discuss HTTP caching.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Tx\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Simon\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n\n\n"}}
