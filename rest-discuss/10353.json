Thus implying HATEOS.\n\nWhat I am wondering about is - how does something lke\nurl.com/search?s=temp1 and url.com/search?s=temp2 etc. look like in\nthis graph? Is it a single node or infinites nodes? If it is a single\nnode, then shouldn&#39;t GET always give the same representation?\n\nI know this might be a little academic, but it actually popped into my\nmind while I was reading RESTful Web Services.\n\nRegards,\nDevdatta\n\n"}}
