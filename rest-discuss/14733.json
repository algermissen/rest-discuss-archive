As far as generic clients\ngo, I think they can infer the editability of a resource by the\npresence of a link rel=&#39;edit&#39; without needing to consult a service\ndocument.  The response to a PUT request is what&#39;s authoritative, not\nany sort of service document.  Allow headers work just as well to\nprovide a hint as to acceptable methods.\n\nWhere I do use a &quot;service document&quot; in an otherwise-Atom Protocol\nsystem, I repurpose Google&#39;s XML sitemaps so I have a hierarchical\nformat, instead of using a root-level flat-file document to define a\nhierarchy.\n\nYou can also have feeds of feeds in Atom, so I don&#39;t really understand\nthe disadvantage you&#39;re seeing.  I didn&#39;t propose Atom as the magical\nsolution to your problem, merely as a way forward.  Once you&#39;ve\nidentified its actual shortcomings, you&#39;re free to abandon it, but it\nwill give you an awful lot of ideas on how to use link relations\nproperly.  See it through, though, since it provides a useful guideline\non how to arrange and link collections.\n\nYou can use standard link relations, even if you use your own\nvocabulary as a resource model.  Better to use standard media types,\nthough.\n\n-Eric\n\n&quot;piers_lawson&quot; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Mike, thank you for pointing out the draft inlining spec... it was\n&gt; interesting.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jan, I started off the thread suggesting a format similar to the one\n&gt; that you put forward as one of my alternatives. I have been convinced\n&gt; by the idea that really the collection should not contain Account\n&gt; elements but some sort of link. The inlining idea is good in that it\n&gt; formalises combining a link with some data from the target\n&gt; resource.... at least it would be if the spec  had moved forward from\n&gt; being a draft ;-)\n&gt; \n&gt; However, what I&#39;m really pushing for is an example of publishing a\n&gt; feed (or even feeds) within other content, for example within the\n&gt; seller element from my last post. If I end up with something similar\n&gt; to my last post (i.e. a seller element that contains a feed element)\n&gt; I&#39;m back to a custom vocabulary... at which point I can&#39;t see the\n&gt; advantage of using Atom feeds... a generic client would never find\n&gt; the feeds in the first place (because my seller element doesn&#39;t look\n&gt; anything like a Service document)... Any thoughts?\n&gt; \n\n"}}
