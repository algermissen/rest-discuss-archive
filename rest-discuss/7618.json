HTTP&#39;s REST replaces the\n&gt; doSomething concept with a &quot;make something so&quot; concept. If you think\n&gt; about it, all doSomething can be modelled this way. Instead of &quot;make\n&gt; this kind of state transition&quot;, just &quot;make your state this&quot;. You have to\n\nnot every function can be modeled around state transitions. \n\n&gt; get into specific examples to see how this works. The first example of\n&gt; starting or stopping a function is the same as setting a running\n&gt; resource to false or true. Do you have more examples in mind? What kind\n&gt; of process would you like to create?\n&gt; \n&gt; The general approach to process creation would either be:\n&gt; POST a representation of the process to a factory resource to create it.\n&gt; PUT a representation of the process to the process resource to change\n&gt; its operation.\n&gt; DELETE the process to destroy it.\n&gt; PUT a false to the process&#39;s &quot;running&quot; resource to suspend it.\n&gt; etc ...\n\nok, here is my current understanding:\nwhen you want to model a business process as REST, assuming it is an actual process, that creates information, not just a tool to manipulate one, then:\n- if the BP works on a single entity, with no other parameters, then maybe it can be modeled as changing a property of that entity:\n  - scheduleServiceStart(Service, Date) -&gt; PUT date into http://example.com/service/foo/schedule\n\n- if the BP has multiple arguments, either break to several BP:\n  - scheduleService(Service, Action, Date) -&gt; (for each action) PUT date into http://example.com/service/foo/action-schedule\n\n- otherwise, create a ProcessManager resource and POST to it the details of the BP. maybe partition BP and create a ProcessManager for each group (scheduler for schedules, others for other actions)\n\n\nis this about right?\n\nif so, then isn&#39;t the ProcessManager a wrapper around RPC? the above process does mean that many functions inside a server can be turned to non-RPC REST API. \n\n&gt; \n&gt; Benjamin.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n-- \n===================================\nIttay Dror, \nChief architect, \nR&D, Qlusters Inc.\nittayd@...\n+972-3-6081994 Fax: +972-3-6081841\n\nwww.openqrm.org - Data Center Provisioning\n\n"}}
