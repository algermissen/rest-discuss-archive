What I&#39;ve implemented is XSLTC, here&#39;s an o=\r\nversimplified overview, imagine each ;view=3D option as *.xsl, and realize =\r\nthey&#39;re all transforming the same Atom document and that the menu links are=\r\n implemented in the XSLT file:\n\n/resource;view=3Dtext  &lt;-- text-only versio=\r\nn of the resource\n/resource;view=3Dprint  &lt;-- content (including images) on=\r\nly no menus\n/resource;view=3Dedit  &lt;-- like the print view except in a &lt;for=\r\nm&gt;\n\nThose three respond 200 OK, as they serve both as alternate representat=\r\nions and as resources in their own right.  Back functionality preserved.  O=\r\nutput is HTML 4.01 but with no DOCTYPE, except for ;view=3Dedit which uses =\r\nthe markup language most compatible with the client based on content negoti=\r\nation, as are these options:\n\n/resource;view=3Dmobile  &lt;-- XHTML Basic 1.1\n=\r\n/resource;view=3Dxhtml  &lt;-- XHTML 1.1\n/resource;view=3Dhtml  &lt;-- HTML 4.01\n=\r\n\nThese are determined by content negotiation, IE and anything else not grok=\r\nking &#39;application/xhtml+xml&#39; gets HTML markup and all the frivolous class a=\r\nttributes required for backwards CSS compatibility with IE &lt; 7, and a silly=\r\n &quot;IE Conditional Comment&quot; to give IE &gt;=3D 7 the same CSS as other modern br=\r\nowsers, which of course get the XHTML 1.1 _representation_ of the site.\n\nA =\r\nFirefox user can append ;view=3Dhtml to any /resource on my system and view=\r\n the HTML 4.01 alternate representation of the content, but they&#39;ll be 303-=\r\nredirected back to /resource to set it (as I explained in my treatise, &quot;Rep=\r\nresentational Cookies&quot;).  An IE user can select ;view=3Dxhtml but they&#39;ll g=\r\net a dialog box asking how they want to save the unknown &#39;application/octet=\r\n-stream&#39;.\n\nI extended my content-negotiation-override mechanism to provide =\r\nthe text-only, print and edit representations but yes, they&#39;re all also res=\r\nources.  I call the result a Representation Management System, though, sinc=\r\ne the purpose is to allow a visitor to a website to select a different repr=\r\nesentation suited to their needs.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Why not allow PUT to the html templat=\r\ne portion of that &#39;editor&#39; resource?\n&gt;What would happen if you did?\n&gt;\n\nWhy =\r\nnot?  Enough complexity already with this system.  ;)  Also, it doesn&#39;t mak=\r\ne sense to me.  The editor is provided to edit the resource, allowing PUT t=\r\no that editor resource would presumably be to change what &lt;textarea&gt; replac=\r\nement editor it links to, or somesuch.\n\nAllowing PUT to the editor document=\r\n rather than the /resource could also be a means to allow editing of the ge=\r\nnerated menu links for the /resource, overriding anything automatically gen=\r\nerated, allowing the webmaster to &quot;hide&quot; a page from public view.  Just som=\r\ne thoughts.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
