Say i write a script to crawl my\n&gt; wiki and apply for media types based on the documentation there.  Of\n&gt; course, i point my script to the iana page.\n&gt; \n&gt; Scenario (a):  Iana adds a &quot;donate&quot; form.  My script breaks because it\n&gt; expected only one form on the page.  The out-of-band knowledge was\n&gt; that where is only one form on the page.  Adding a second form to a\n&gt; page is perfectly legal in (x)html.  There is no way for my script to\n&gt; tell the server it can only work with the single form version of the\n&gt; page.\n&gt; \n\nI still don&#39;t follow.  If you coded up a client according to the self-\ndocumenting API, the presence of a new form would not change the\nbehavior of that client -- it doesn&#39;t change how URLs are constructed\nor the target of the POST.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Scenerio (b):  I point my script to your page.  It does not work, of\n&gt; course, because there is no input named &quot;name&quot;.\n&gt;\n\nWhy would your script be looking for that input?  Why would you expect\nto not have to re-code the script if the API changes?  Why not just\ntreat the HTML as a recipe?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Your page is a incompatible derivative of the iana page.  However,\n&gt; that is not surfaced explicitly anywhere.  Worse yet, what the script\n&gt; can/should expect is not documented anywhere.\n&gt; \n\nThe v2 API is self-documenting.  It&#39;s obvious that sending a registrant\nname is now the variable &#39;registrant-name&#39;, so change the script to send\nthat instead of the variable &#39;name&#39;, etc.  The assumption is that the\npage I made would replace the previous one, at the same URI -- pretty\nexplicit that this is the new version.  I fail to see what isn&#39;t\ndocumented.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; In both cases the fundamental issue is that my script is coupled to a\n&gt; specific service implementation rather than a media type.  Any change\n&gt; in the specific implementation is likely to cause issues.  (Browsers,\n&gt; on the other hand, are coupled to the html media type.  They can take\n&gt; any valid html document and render it successfully.)\n&gt; \n\nNo, the changes are not going to break any client whose developer used\nthe HTML as a guideline to coding the behavior of the client, by\ntreating it as API documentation.  The HTML can always be modified, and\nan ontology created such that looking for a specific RDFa attribute with\na specific value returns the current variable name.\n\nI don&#39;t see how any of these problems are solved by creating a custom\nmedia type, or disappear when a custom media type is used (unless it&#39;s\nbeing treated as an object key instead of as a processing model\ndeclaration).  The HTML I wrote clearly specifies the API, in a way\nwhich can be understood by anyone on the planet who speaks English; any\nmisunderstandings are cleared up by actually driving the API using that\nactive documentation.\n\nI&#39;m still not seeing the alleged drawbacks here.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
