You&#39;d need to use a forms language in order\nto be able to declare that URI structure for consumption by the\nclient, otherwise client and server would be more tightly coupled than\nis necessary and this could hurt the evolvability of your application.\n\nThe other thing is the data formats and the use of application/xml.\nFor content negotiation (not to mention other uses), application/xml\nis meaningless, because there&#39;s no way to distinguish between a\nrequest for XHTML versus one for Atom (and moreover, no interop\ndefined between the two, unlike with RDF/XML vocabularies).  So you\nshould either reuse existing media types (e.g. text/html with the\nhCard microformat for &quot;person&quot;), or mint media types such as\napplication/vnd.blinksale.person+xml.  Otherwise your messages won&#39;t\nbe self-descriptive.\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
