E.g., can each message passing from buyer to seller be  \n&gt; mapped onto an HTTP request, and each message from seller to buyer  \n&gt; an HTTP response? Or am I completely misunderstanding the intention  \n&gt; of the diagram?\n\nMy intention was to provide an example of how you can place object  \nnodes on the swim lanes to visualize the payload. I did not mean to  \npoint you to the collaboration actually shown in that diagram. (It is  \nnot a RESTstyle interaction but message passing with fixed endpoints -  \nother story anyway).\n\nIn my diarams I show each HTTP message as an object node. Request and  \nresponse.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m interested because I&#39;ve been trying to figure out the best  \n&gt; conventions for diagramming workflow that map cleanly onto a  \n&gt; hypermedia / REST service design. Your activity diagram is quite  \n&gt; different from the type of state transition diagrams used in [2].\n\nThose are state diagrams, showing the current&#39;s client application  \nstate. That is another thing you could model that I forgot to mention.  \nBeware though, that this is also never a design artifact but a runtime  \nexample (since the actual state machine is not known at design time -  \nit is discovered at run time).\n\n\n&gt; Maybe I shouldn&#39;t be trying to compare [1] and [2] because they&#39;re  \n&gt; trying to model different aspects of the system? Sorry, thinking out  \n&gt; loud...\n\nSee previous sentence.\n\nJan\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; Alistair.\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] http://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/cs-UBL-2.0/art/UBL-2.0-OrderingProcess.jpg\n&gt; [2] http://www.infoq.com/articles/webber-rest-workflow\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Jan Algermissen  \n&gt; &lt;algermissen1971@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Dec 21, 2009, at 11:56 AM, swschilke wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear Everbody,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; you are such a valuable resource for knowledge about REST that I\n&gt;&gt;&gt; apologize to bother you with my questions:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; No need to apologize - that is the purpose of this list.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; What would you recommend to visualize REST (WADL) architectures?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve read some papers proposing extensions e.g., to UML, but I am\n&gt;&gt;&gt; open to recommendations (worst case I use Powerpoint).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; What do you intend to visualize?
