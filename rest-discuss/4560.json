But no, I have the same\n&gt; issue with either, a) expecting the query results in the POST response,\n&gt; and b) expecting the query results in a GET on the returned Location\n&gt; URI.  The issue is not the mechanism, it&#39;s the additional expectation,\n&gt; since it&#39;s not one that can be met by other resources and therefore\n&gt; neither uniform nor RESTful.  Said another way, I couldn&#39;t POST a query\n&gt; document to any old resource and expect it to understand that I expect\n&gt; back the results, nor could I assume that anything I got back from an\n&gt; arbitrary resource was the results of the query document being processed\n&gt; as a query.\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;m confused now.  What can I expect after I&#39;ve POSTed something to a \nresource?\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n"}}
