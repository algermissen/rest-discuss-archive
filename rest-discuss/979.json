Which the Buyer will check in the \n&gt; future.  All the documents except the &quot;Ack&quot; are in the control of the \n&gt; Seller.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry if this is tedious, but if I rephrase, it may tell you if I \n&gt; understand or not.  Did I?\n\nI think so, except perhaps for that last sentence.  The ack is\nreturned as a response, not as a POST request, so technically\nthe seller still &quot;controls&quot; it.\n\n&gt; Ok, then, next complication:  the offer to buy should not be good \n&gt; forever, it should have a time constraint.  At the appointed time, \n&gt; the Buyer could check the URI for the Acceptance or Rejection \n&gt; document and if it&#39;s not there, the deal is off.  How would you \n&gt; handle that?  We want it to be clear to both parties that the deal is \n&gt; off, so they don&#39;t end up in court because the Seller tried to keep \n&gt; going.\n\nYou could do this two ways.  One would be as Mike said, to include\nthe time information in the document.  There&#39;s nothing wrong with\nthis at all.\n\nAnother way would be to generalize the whole &quot;message validity&quot;\nmechanism and build an extension header with HTTP or SOAP to support\nit for any message.  You&#39;d need a mandatory extension mechanism to\ndeploy it, otherwise you&#39;d never know if the receiver knew what you were\ntalking about.  That would be an interesting extension, for sure.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
