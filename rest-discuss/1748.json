REST is about more than just the generic interface.\n\n&gt; S. Mike Dierken wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes - I forgot to mention that in my e-mail... a RDBMS is solving a\n&gt; different problem, so it won&#39;t have the same list of architectural\n&gt; characteristics as REST, but the flexibility to implement any\n&gt; application-specific operation on top of CRUD is similar to the ability to\n&gt; implement any application-specif operation on top of GPPD\n&gt; (GET/PUT/POST/DELETE).\n\nI find the idea of a Resource having many Representations bears many\nsimilarities to the idea of a Logical Entity (as in logical vs. physical\nmodels) in Relational Theory. In SQL, views provide representations of\nlogical entities that may span many physical tables. Obviously the mechanism\nfor identifying and resolving an entity is different to identifying and\nresolving a resource but the principles seem similar. Can a *View* in SQL be\nconsidered a rough equivalent to a *Representation* of a resource in REST?\n\nUnfortunately SQL Databases don&#39;t allow updates through views that span\nmultiple tables. Therefore a true separation of the logical model from the\nphysical model has never been fully realised :-( Fortunately for a REST+HTTP\nbased architecture this separation seems to be fundamental in the sense that\nI can PUT/POST one representation to a resource (assuming of course that the\nresource understands and supports them) and GET a different one back based\non Content Negotiation, Etags or URI query parameters.\n\nRobert.\n\n\n\n"}}
