I\nthink of this as &#39;non-overlapping&#39; resources. I&#39;m interested in issues\nsurrounding &#39;overlapping&#39; resources.\n\nFor example, if I change Don&#39;s example to (omitting xlink stuff):\n&lt;customer&gt;\n  &lt;primary href=&quot;http://store1.some.org/customers/6672&quot; firstName=&quot;mike&quot;\nlastName=&quot;dierken&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;secondary href=&quot;http://store2.some.org/customers/6672&quot; zipCode=&quot;98034&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/customer&gt;\n\nWhere the firstName, lastName and zipCode are also resident in the other\nresources, then you run into interesting questions\n - can you update the primary resource?\n - what caching/syncronization issues are there?\n\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Donald Strong&quot; &lt;dstrong@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;algermissen@...&gt;; &quot;rest-discuss&quot; &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, July 08, 2004 6:12 PM\nSubject: RE: [rest-discuss] Distributed Requests\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The idea of a URL referencing more than one resource or indirectly\n&gt; referencing a resource, as in (1) below, does not sit comfortably\n&gt; with me.\n&gt;\n&gt; I assume a redirect is not approriate.\n&gt;\n&gt; My opinion is...\n&gt;\n&gt; A resource identified by a URL is an entity in its own right.\n&gt; If it happens to be a composite of other resources it can do\n&gt; that in one of two ways; implicitly or explicitly.\n&gt;\n&gt; Implicit composition:\n&gt;    The resource is a process that, without the requester knowing,\n&gt;    makes further requests to far flung reaches of the galaxy and\n&gt;    correlates the results for presentation to the requester.\n&gt;    POSTs to this resource, similarly, are disected and deceminated\n&gt;    without the requester having the foggiest idea what is happening\n&gt;    behind the scenes. PUTs are not appropriate to this resource,\n&gt;    however it may be appropriate for the resource to PUT to the\n&gt;    other resources depending upon their interfaces.\n&gt;    This resembles the facade pattern from the Gang of Four.\n&gt;\n&gt; Explicit composition:\n&gt;    The response returned by the resource contains explicit links\n&gt;    to its constituant parts. An example would be if the response\n&gt;    encoding was XML it could contain XLinks to the constituent\n&gt;    parts of the document.\n&gt;\n&gt;         http://infosystem.org/customers/66726\n&gt;\n&gt;         &lt;customer&gt;\n&gt;             &lt;primary title=&quot;Primary Customer Information&quot;\n&gt;                      href=&quot;http://store1.some.org/customers/6672&quot;\n&gt;                      show=&quot;embed&quot;\n&gt;                      actuate=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;             &lt;secondary title=&quot;Secondary Customer Information&quot;\n&gt;                      href=&quot;http://store2.some.org/customers/6672&quot;\n&gt;                      show=&quot;embed&quot;\n&gt;                      actuate=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;         &lt;/customer&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    (Disclaimer - I know little about xlink aside from the examples\n&gt;     in my 1999 XML Pocket reference so the example above is\n&gt;     probably completely wrong, but you get the idea.)\n&gt;\n&gt;    The client requesting this resource must immediately retrieve\n&gt;    and embed the resources referenced by the response. The client\n&gt;    now has sufficient information to PUT or POST to the initial\n&gt;    resource or any of the embedded resources. Whether the client\n&gt;    has the authority to do so is a separate issue.\n&gt;\n&gt; I leave the pros and cons for each approach as an exercise for the\n&gt; reader, but I would point out that processing the explicit\n&gt; composition response requires a much more intelligent client,\n&gt; ie. not a browser.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Donald.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: jan@...

If (1) was a\n&gt; &gt; RESTful option, this\n&gt; &gt; could well be extended to arbitrary property/value constellations\n&gt; &gt; for communicating\n&gt; &gt; what one refers to, e.g.\n&gt; http://store.org/about?http://myprops/ISBN=0093661778\n&gt; This would IMHO break the whole idea of simply &#39;uttering a URI&#39;.\n&gt;\n&gt; The questions I have about (2) are:\n&gt;\n&gt; - although I have never heard any objections from the REST POV against a\n&gt; resource\n&gt;   spanning multiple authorities, I am still not sure that REST explicitly\n&gt; allows\n&gt;   the situation described in (2). I am thinking of this as to &#39;distribute\n&gt; the\n&gt;   invocation of the representation-resource membership function&#39;....ok?\n&gt;\n&gt; - usually, several representations returned for multiple requests to a\n&gt; single\n&gt;   resource are understood to be mutually exclusive, but in the case\n&gt; described in\n&gt;   (2), the various representations are *combined* to form another one.\n&gt;   Is this RESTful?\n&gt;\n&gt; - I would also like to do this the other way round (distributing POST,PUT\n&gt; and\n&gt;   DELETE) and while technically possible, I am also not sure if this case\n&gt;   would break any REST constraint.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Thoughts?\n&gt;\n&gt; Jan\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] which is (thanks Mark :o) formally defined as\n&gt;     http://www.markbaker.ca/2003/rdfforms/Indexable/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Jan Algermissen                           http://www.topicmapping.com\n&gt; Consultant & Programmer                   http://www.gooseworks.org\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
