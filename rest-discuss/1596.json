To\n&gt; take this analogy completely:\n&gt; \n&gt; In canonical REST, you would be POSTing a &quot;punch&quot; action document to my nose\n&gt; (verb = POST)\n&gt; \n&gt; In simple English, you are *punching* my nose (verb = punch).\n&gt; \n&gt; My nose may bleeds as a side effect, possibly, but that is hardly the verb\n&gt; of interest here. 8-)\n\nAhh... reverse your thinking.  In REST, you are all about transfering \nstate.  So, when you want to punch me, what are you changing?  Are you \nchanging the state of my nose to bleed, or are you changing the state of \nyour fist to &quot;thrust&quot;?\n\nI would say you are PUTing a new state of your fist to the server.  The \nserver then responds with a document describing the new state of my nose \n(bleeding).\n\nSince you don&#39;t control me, you can only change the state of your object \n(to one of attacking).  The server can then run through what &quot;Joe is now \nattacking&quot; means to the world.  The server would then run through some \nbusiness logic, and determine that you indeed hit me and I am bleeding. \n  That is a server induced state change, which can be communicated back \nto you.\n\nSeth\n\n\n"}}
