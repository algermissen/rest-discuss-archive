If you want to\n&gt; &gt; apply the design criteria of another system then the basic architecture\n&gt; &gt; and requirements have to be similar. That&#39;s clearly not true of SMB/CIFS\n&gt; &gt; so maybe we could stop talking about it.\n&gt; \n&gt; The amazing thing about SMB/CIFS vis-a-vis the Web isn&#39;t that its &quot;basic architecture&quot;\n&gt; (whatever that means, we&#39;re talking about names, here) is similar, and I have no visibility to\n&gt; its requirements a priori.  The amazing thing about SMB/CIFS is the *almost identical to HTTP\n&gt; URI* naming scheme it employs.  It doesn&#39;t take much head-scratching to realize that the same\n&gt; problems yield the same solutions, and indeed, the similarity of the two is a rather striking\n&gt; example of the ToII.\n\nI keep telling you that the inventors of SMB/CIFS are as dogmatic about\nthe opacity principle as we are, and they back it up with licensing\nprograms and stickers.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, and what a good idea that turned out to be. ;-)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s an excellent idea.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now I know you&#39;re broken.  ;-)  The Windows registry is the worst idea ever, hands down, end\n&gt; of story.  It&#39;s such a bad idea that getting away from the registry and from &quot;DLL Hell&quot; ---\n&gt; i.e., enabling plug-and-go installation of software just by writing directories and files ---\n&gt; was supposedly one of the original motivations of the research effort that became .NET.\n\nYou&#39;re not listening and you edited out the part of the message that\npoints out that UNIX is the same in this regard as Windows. Yes the\nregistry is a bad idea. Microsoft happens to indirect through the\nregistry. The indirection is a good idea. That&#39;s why Unix does it too,\nthrough &quot;~&quot;, &quot;TEMPDIR&quot;, &quot;HOME&quot; and /etc/passwd.\n\nBecause Unix now has an efficient concept of symlinks, it could probably\nget away with having a root directory called /plan9/homdirs which\norganized everything in the plan9 style and another root directory\ncalled /linux/homedirs which organized everything in the Linux style.\nBut the Web *does not have* an efficient concept of symlinks. Instead it\nhas hyperlinks.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ... Contrast this with systems where\n&gt; &gt; &gt; installing an entire piece of software is simply a matter of unpacking a tarball in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; directory.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You&#39;re talking about something totally different.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s part-and-parcel of the same thing.  Squint, you can see it.\n\nNo, it isn&#39;t part and parcel of the same thing. Indirecting well-known\npaths through something like an environment variable or registry setting\nor hypertext document has *nothing to do* with whether installation goes\ninto a single directory. You&#39;re just trying to tar the idea through\nproximity to bad ideas.\n\n&gt; (a) The redirect issue is a complete red herring, as I&#39;ve already illustrated.  Name opacity\n&gt; has *nothing at all* to do with redirection and relocation.\n\nLet&#39;s put it this way. Opaque names and non-opaque names can both be\nredirected and relocated equally easily. *BUT* if the authoritative,\nofficial way to navigate from one name to another is through name\nsimilarlity relationships rather than through hypertext relationships\nthen it becomes impossible for two related names to be directly served\noff of unrelated servers in a domain-name based system. Therefore you\nneed the hypertext to be authoritative in which case the names are\neffectively opaque again because you are no longer relying on their\nsimilarity.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
