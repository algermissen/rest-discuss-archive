Murphy?\n\nAs for the original example, if the application is designed\nwithout user-specific resource URLs, it will not be possible to\neven link to cities created by other users. Ah well, foreign\ntravel is overrated anyways.\n\n&gt; But it is demonstrably necessary\n&gt; to make URLs to things that behave differently for different people\n&gt; (whether different because of conneg, or language sniffing, or HTTP\n&gt; version or username/password or ...)\n\nI would like to see your demonstration that HTTP Auth is necessary\nto the REST model. I would also like to see your rebuttal to my\nargument that using HTTP Auth to provide user-specific responses\nviolates REST principles. I provided my argument in 5 simple\nsteps.  Show me yours.\n\nTyler\n\n"}}
