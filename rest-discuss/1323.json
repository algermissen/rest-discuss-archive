So go ahead and use one. \nMy\n&gt; only complaints are:\n&gt; \n&gt;  a) they don&#39;t generate events in my inbox\n&gt; \n&gt;  b) the editing user interface is so brutal.\n\nI agree with you on both of the above.  But then I use Yahoo Groups \nstrictly from the browser (do not get emails) so it is even worse.\n\nHowever, you are one of the main people I want to engage, so let&#39;s \nkeep going in rest-discuss for a bit and I&#39;ll summarize anything we \nagree on to the rest-wiki page.  Maybe the best of both venues, such \nas they are.\n\nThe three main scenarios I remember from previous rest-discuss \nconversations were:\n\n1. Event notifications (publish-subscribe).  They already have their \nown rest-wiki page: \nhttp://internet.conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/HttpEvents\n\n2. Purchasing (offer-acceptance), with many fragments of conversation \non rest-discuss, but no rest-wiki page.\n\nPurchasing can be client-server, in which case Amazon is probably the \ndefacto standard, and is fairly RESTful.  Peer-to-peer for B2B is \ndifferent, and the existing standards (RosettaNet and ebXML) use \nsomething like EDI-mailbox-style SOAP.  (ebXML actually uses SOAP, \nRNet uses something analogous that they defined way before SOAP.)\n\n3. Travel: your Expedia example, and another based on Appendix D of \nthe Web Services Flow Language document.\n\nExpedia is client-server; I think the WSFL example included P2P \ninteractions.  \n\nThen there were a couple of rest-discuss threads on session state, \nthat is analogous to transaction-state or conversation-state in P2P \nEDI-mailbox-style.\n\nI&#39;m most interested in trying to RESTify B2B transactions.  \nBy &quot;transaction&quot;, I mean &quot;business state alignment&quot; between two \ntrading partners, for example, an offer-acceptance transaction where \nboth parties have definitive evidence of agreement that the offer was \naccepted (or not).\n\nAnd yes I do think the transaction-model issue deserves its own rest-\nwiki page.\n\nMy next step is to collect a bunch of URLs to previous rest-discuss \nthread-starting messages and other related documents.  I&#39;ll post them \non a separate rest-wiki page linked to the StateMachinesAsHypertext \npage.\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
