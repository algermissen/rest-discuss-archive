I don&#39;t think the AF hide HTTP at all, or when\nthey do, it&#39;s much less than the CF do. With something like JSF or Play,\netc. HTTP is completely buried.

In fact, one of their primary goals,\nespecially early one, was binding URLs to logic, logic that can represent\nresources.\n\nObviously, in the early days, it was all about forms and pages, because\nthat&#39;s the meat and potatoes of web applications, before the &quot;formality&quot; of\nresources and REST etc.\n\nThe biggest crime of the legacy action framework is they tend to hide the\nHTTP method, conflating GET and POST more often than not, and having little\nsupport for the others. This is not a capital crime however, since\npragmatically when dealing with raw web browsers, that&#39;s all you can get\nanyway. Recall that almost all of this is not so much influenced by HTTP,\nbut by the browsers that leverage it. Only in the past few years has &quot;pure&quot;\nHTTP processing risen, especially with the rise of XHR and ad hoc &quot;RESTful&quot;\n*cough* web services.\n\nAdding method support to the AFs that don&#39;t support it is really\nstraightforward.\n\nMore modern &quot;rest&quot; frameworks like JAX-RS offer more robust binding and\ndispatch options based on URLs than the earlier AFs, simply because of the\ndemand for even more exposure to HTTP. They also offer better support for\ncontent types other than HTML. But these are evolutionary frameworks, not\nrevolutionary. The basic concept of mapping URLs to logic is fundamental,\nbut the modern ones add more features for better access to HTTP methods,\ncontent type management, etc.\n\nJAX-RS works just fine as a conventional Java AF, with requests coming in,\nlogic being peroformed, and results displayed through forwarded JSP. it&#39;s\njust not marketed as such, and there are few tutorials demonstrating it\nused as such.\n\nThe older AFs aren&#39;t going anywhere, their methodologies are quite valid\nfor a wide range of use cases on the modern web, they&#39;re well documented,\nand there&#39;s a huge amount brain share trained in the techniques.
