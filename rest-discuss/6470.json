I didn&#39;t intend to argue \nagainst it.\n\nMaybe I just misunderstood the whole thread but at some point I got the \nimpression that people wanted servers/frameworks to always handle \napplication/x-www-form-urlencoded as a special case, no matter what the \nmethod type was.\n\nSo yes, if a server implements PUT, and the nature of the resource is \ncompatible with a set of name/value pairs, then that content type if \nperfectly ok for both GET and PUT.\n\nHowever, I would expect that if I use PUT and only set two names out of \nthree, the other one gets deleted (PUT is not a partial update, if you \nwant that, use POST).\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n"}}
