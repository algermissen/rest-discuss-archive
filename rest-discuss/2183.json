With PUT, you are directly setting the resource&#39;s \n&gt; state by explicitly providing a representation of the resource&#39;s \n&gt; (entire) new state.  \n&gt; \n&gt; With POST, you can only indirectly change the resource&#39;s state by \n&gt; providing a representation of something that the resource will then use \n&gt; in a manner of its choosing to change its own state.  In other words, \n&gt; you dont directly or explicitly specify the resource&#39;s new state - you \n&gt; just provide the resource with some information and it decides how to \n&gt; change its state based on that new information.\n\nBingo, exactly.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
