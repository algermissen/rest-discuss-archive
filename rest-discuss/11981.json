Even for content type (i.e. separate .html .xml .json URIs\n&gt; for different representations of the same resource).\n\nThis advice ignores a significant chunk of Web architecture.\n\n&gt; The rationale is that, if I send you a link (say, in an email) to\n&gt; example.com/document that I had negotiated as the german xml\n&gt; representation - if you follow that link; your browser will open and\n&gt; request the english html representation. Apparently that&#39;s a problem,\n&gt; although I remain thoroughly unconvinced of this if these are in fact\n&gt; merely separate representations of the *same* resource.\n\nSure, there are cases when you want to be able to link to a specific\nrepresentation, and you can still provide for this.\n\nLet&#39;s say you have the following document:\n\n  http://example.org/doc\n\nThis is available in English and German. Your computer system is configured with\nan English locale and so when you request the document you get the English\nversion. If you pass a link to your friend who is German, his system is\nconfigured with a German locale and so he will get the German version. This is\ntransparent localisation, which is great!\n\nThere might be times when you want to bypass this system. Perhaps the document\nis an excerpt from Wittgenstein&#39;s Tractatus and you want to make a comment about\nthe German version explicitly.\n\nYou provide the following language variants:\n\n  http://example.org/doc.en\n  http://example.org/doc.de\n\nInclude something like the following in the head element:\n\n  &lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; hreflang=&quot;en&quot; href=&quot;/doc.en&quot; title=&quot;English&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; hreflang=&quot;de&quot; href=&quot;/doc.de&quot; title=&quot;Deutsche&quot;&gt;\n\nInclude something in the body element that renders similar to:\n\n  Available languages: [English], [Deutsche]\n\nYou can now select a variant and pass the link to a friend without it being\nnegotiated. Using this method, you are providing first class language variants\nand a resource that knows how to negotiate between them. Best of both worlds.\n\n-- \nNoah Slater, http://tumbolia.org/nslater\n\n"}}
