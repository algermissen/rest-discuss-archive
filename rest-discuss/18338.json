Sounds like you underestimate the =\r\nusefulness of the massively\n&gt;&gt; distributed architecture called Internet. :)=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Internet became massively useful after 1) distributed name resolution\n=\r\n&gt; called DNS was invented and 2) search engines became powerful enough.\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Unless we are assuming any REST system is an isolated server\n&gt;&gt;&gt; or s=\r\nerver farm, running under single authority, and all potential\n&gt;&gt;&gt; users and=\r\n clients are aware of it and love to read its documentation.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The ambi=\r\nguity of REST/HTTP is exactly why it *is* so powerful as a concept.\n&gt;\n&gt; AFA=\r\nIK , REST is not defined as HTTP specific, on the contrary.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you h=\r\nave to work a little harder on the application semantics and the\n&gt;&gt; glue of=\r\n the ontology layer, but it comes with the amazing bonus of all the\n&gt;&gt; good=\r\nness of WWW. Surely, we can&#39;t ignore its success? It&#39;s the ease of\n&gt;&gt; worki=\r\nng with it, of setting it up, and the ambigous nature of each request\n&gt;&gt; (t=\r\nhat can be tunneled through anything) and the constraints on them (for\n&gt;&gt; c=\r\nacheability, etc.) that makes that possible.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t challenge the u=\r\nsefulness of catch-all POST on network level,\n&gt; on the contrary.\n&gt;\n&gt; What I=\r\n do challenge is the missing semantic level, which makes\n&gt; impossible to fi=\r\nnd out what all these resources are about. I don&#39;t\n&gt; understand what&#39;s wron=\r\ng of admitting HTTP is _the_ transport level for\n&gt; myriad of specific appli=\r\ncations, defining their own semantics in the\n&gt; HTTP message body payload. =\r\n=A0Or do we perceive OSI architecture fixed\n&gt; in stone once and forever? =\r\n=A0Sure it is in the textbooks, but not\n&gt; always as positive example. It is=\r\n often cited that early in the\n&gt; Internet history, there were no precise id=\r\nea what the applications\n&gt; will appear, so why we insist there could be no =\r\nlayer above OSI 7?\n&gt;\n&gt; Comparison with WWW is not fair. =A0There is a singl=\r\ne shared semantic\n&gt; for human readable web pages, and our brains (so far) a=\r\nre way better\n&gt; resolving the semantics, compared to software code.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; F=\r\ninding resources is critical part of any network architecture. If I\n&gt;&gt;&gt; do =\r\nnot know nothing of Amazon, and there is no any search engine\n&gt;&gt;&gt; available=\r\n, =A0how I am supposed to find where to buy online books? Even\n&gt;&gt;&gt; how I am=\r\n supposed to know I _could_ buy books online?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But why are you raising=\r\n these what-if questions? Do you have some scenarios\n&gt;&gt; that you are concre=\r\ntely struggeling with, or are good examples of HTTP gone\n&gt;&gt; bad? I fear I d=\r\no not understand &quot;what if there are no search engines&quot;,\n&gt;&gt; because there ar=\r\ne.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, having used Internet before =A0Altavista, Google, et al. be=\r\ncame\n&gt; into their force, I do remember times when web sites were\n&gt; particip=\r\nating in &quot;rings&quot;, where each site was happy to include links\n&gt; to the next =\r\none in the ring, thus allowing a new sites to become\n&gt; visible. =A0Another =\r\nway to learn about a web site was for somebody to\n&gt; share the link by email=\r\n, or even offline. =A0The HATEOAS &quot;follow your\n&gt; nose&quot; approach reminds me =\r\nexactly this - no global knowledge, just\n&gt; follow the next step. The power =\r\nof Internet rose when the web of links\n&gt; started to be analysed as a whole,=\r\n not just looking at the next peek.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, web services (not only RES=\r\nT) are in the pre-search era, quite\n&gt; possible due to common semantics lack=\r\ning. =A0May be because of something\n&gt; else as well. IMHO only of course.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Scenarios - well, couple of, but details are not necessary in the\n&gt; scope=\r\n of this thread. Basically, having number of REST services under\n&gt; common A=\r\nPI running in several places in the world, how do you find if\n&gt; there is a =\r\nspecific piece of information that could be retrieved from\n&gt; any of them, o=\r\nr specific processing capability available? =A0Sure there\n&gt; are custom solu=\r\ntions, but from this discussion I gather a generic one\n&gt; is hardly of inter=\r\nest.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, we do roughly the same, each resource describing itself wi=\r\nth\n&gt;&gt;&gt; RDF, according to a specific ontology. But I would not say this is t=\r\nhe\n&gt;&gt;&gt; mainstream approach.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Depends on where you dip your toe. But ev=\r\nen if that was true, does that make\n&gt;&gt; it wrong?\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course not.\n&gt;\n&gt; Reg=\r\nards,\n&gt; Nina\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Regards,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Alex\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ----------------------------=\r\n--------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
