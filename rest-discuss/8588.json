So setting a device to &quot;on&quot; might be construed the same\n&gt; way without having something in the initial contract to indicate that.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m having some trouble coming up with words that in the REST style, convey\n&gt; a-priori asynchronous behavior.\n\nThe most normal way to deal with async behaviour in REST is to create\na resource (POST to some place) and then poll it for it&#39;s state\nchange.\n\nThis might be appropriate in some circumstances that you&#39;re\ndescribing.\n\nHowever, I can&#39;t see that it matters whether it is async or not. The\ninterface is the interface. You can&#39;t *break* it by mistaking how it\nworks under the hood.\n\nIn other words, the fact that the async or sync nature of the thing is\nhidden is a good thing isn&#39;t it? It&#39;s just implementation detail.\n\n\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   \n\n"}}
