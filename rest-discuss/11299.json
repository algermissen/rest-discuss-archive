W=\r\nith that \nin mind the resource design could be done entirely separately fro=\r\nm the \ndomain design, but I&#39;m wondering whether this is sensible or whether=\r\n \nyou would recommend going further and getting stakeholders/domain \nexpert=\r\ns involved in the resource design (possibly doing this whilst \ndiscussing t=\r\nhe domain model itself).\n\nThanks,\n\nColin\n\n\n"}}
