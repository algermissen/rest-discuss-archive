I think you pointed out some clear arguments for something i had on=\r\nly a gut feeling. \n\nIf i understand this correctly, i could link to an open=\r\nsearch compatibel resource with an URI Template based on this specification=\r\n AND the rel=3D&quot;search&quot; attribute specified by [1]?\n\nFurthermore, I=B4m pla=\r\nying around with the HAL specification [2]. I=B4m asking myself, if i can p=\r\nrovide an URI template instead of an URI. Based on your comment, that URI t=\r\nemplates are valid URIs and a link=B4s relation semantic is defined by a sp=\r\necification, i think i can. \n\nThis would allow linking (highly dynmic) reso=\r\nurce collections with a single URI Template without tight coupling.

Such a link relation specification must include two things:\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; 1) It must specifiy that the URI references used are to be interpreted as=\r\n templates (because a template URI is a valid URI and you cannot tell the d=\r\nifference if you do not know up front that you are given a template URI ref=\r\nerence).\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) What parameters the client might encounter and what they m=\r\nean.\n&gt; \n&gt; An example of this is the opensearch specification[1].\n&gt; \n&gt; Jan\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; [1] http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications/OpenSearch/1.1#OpenSear=\r\nch_1.1_parameters\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
