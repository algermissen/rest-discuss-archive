A REST API provides a resource which can be PUT in some sort of a \n&gt;&gt;test mode, with the agreed-upon behavior being that the PUT always \n&gt;&gt;succeeds.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;2. Clients try to PUT to it; on failure they know they need to revert \n&gt;&gt;to POST /resource with X-TUNNEL-METHOD: PUT or DELETE?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Is it correct to reason from http://host/put_test not being PUT-able \n&gt;&gt;(even though the API on the other end advertises it as such) to the \n&gt;&gt;extrapolation that http://host/some_other_resource isn&#39;t PUT-able \n&gt;&gt;either?\n\nThe only good way to do it seems to me is to try PUT (or DELETE) and\nfall back to the other on failure.\n\nI guess a proxy will send 405.\n\nI&#39;ll send some Javascript to the list coz I need to implement this\ntrick.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
