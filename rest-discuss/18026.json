What exactly are you trying to do with HT=\r\nTP that\n&gt; you can&#39;t do with Rails?\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; won&#39;t be enough of a leverage to c=\r\nhange the whole web. neither was it for people that did non-safe operations=\r\n on Get.\n&gt; \n&gt; That is not a sensible comparison:\n&gt; \n&gt; Using GET for non-saf=\r\ne operations is obviously wrong, as the benefit\n&gt; of GET being safe across =\r\nthe web is clear. On the other hand, the\n&gt; benefit to having guaranteed ful=\r\nlness of a PUT request across the web\n&gt; is _not at all clear_.\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Eventu=\r\nally, people learn and use HTTP the way it&#39;s implemented out there and stop=\r\n breaking things and everybody lives happily after that.\n&gt; \n&gt; So what is th=\r\ne _actual concern_ you have about partial PUT that&#39;s\n&gt; preventing you from =\r\nliving happily ever after? What is it that&#39;s\n&gt; actually being broken?\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;=\r\n As for &quot;fixing&quot; it, indeed there is nothing to be fixed, there&#39;s already P=\r\nOST and PATCH, the stuff that needs fixing is rails.\n&gt; \n&gt; Neither of those =\r\nfixes would actually work in practice - you can&#39;t\n&gt; just swap out partial P=\r\nUT for POST or PATCH because neither of them\n&gt; are idempotent and therefore=\r\n would require clients to remodel how they\n&gt; deal with failed requests.\n\n"}}
