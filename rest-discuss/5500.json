He try to model a resource&#39;s properties\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as explicit resources, so that we can retrieve and update them\n&gt; &gt; &gt; explicitly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here&#39;s the quote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;The reason I say that a bean&#39;s properties are resources (possibly as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; well) is that they do support GET (get) and PUT (set) operations in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; their own right.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But, how to identify property-like resources in URL syntax? Fragment\n&gt; &gt; &gt; URL identifier comes into my mind, but seems like I cannot send PUT to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a &lt;http://foo/bar#baz&gt; in current browsers (I&#39;m not sure is it because\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the specification or an implementation bias, hope someone would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; clarify this).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://foo/bar#baz&gt; is technically not a URI. It is a URI reference,\n&gt; &gt; i.e. it contains a fragment identifier. Fragments are always\n&gt; &gt; intepreted by the client rather than the server. When the request is\n&gt; &gt; made the fragment will be stripped to create a URI to send to the\n&gt; &gt; server. When the server sends a response your web browser will look\n&gt; &gt; for the &quot;baz&quot; anchor within the response.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The construction of the URI could take several forms.\n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://foo/bar/baz&gt; would be fine, as would something like\n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://foo/bar?comment=baz&gt;. I know some RESTafarians disagree, but I\n&gt; &gt; see the query part of a URI (which unlike the fragment is sent to the\n&gt; &gt; server side) as a useful way for a server to denote to itself that a\n&gt; &gt; temporary resource needs to be created in order to handle the request.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The query approach could be applied more generally. I believe that\n&gt; &gt; elsewhere in this thread the notion of updating only part of a\n&gt; &gt; database record was discussed. You could set up a URI that refers to\n&gt; &gt; this subset explicitly, and allows a PUT to the subset.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There are disadvantages to having multiple resources who&#39;s state\n&gt; &gt; overlaps.\n&gt; Ah, I never thought of caching issue before this. Thanks for remind. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I believe that elsewhere in this thread the concept of patching was\n&gt; &gt; discussed as an update technique. It may interest readers to know that\n&gt; &gt; PATCH was a legal method for HTTP/1.1 circa rfc2068, and may be better\n&gt; &gt; to use than PUT in this case.\n&gt; \n&gt; But why they gave up PATCH in final draft of HTTP/1.1 spec? I just\n&gt; find that PATCH was re-raised again by WebDAV in another expired draft\n&gt; [1]. I think I will need sometime to digest them.\n&gt; [1] http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-dusseault-http-patch-06.html\n\n&quot;The PATCH, LINK, UNLINK methods were defined but not commonly\nimplemented in previous versions of this specification.&quot;\n\nI think they were not common enough to make it into the main HTTP/1.1\nspecification. Nevermind, it&#39;s always possible to specify such things in\nadjuncts such as WEBDAV.\n\n&gt; &gt; I suggest that populating a web form with current data before allowing a\n&gt; &gt; user to modify only the fields they want to change is probably the\n&gt; &gt; simplest and most canonical way of all.\n&gt; That&#39;s right. ;) BTW, do you have any implementation idea in mind to\n&gt; update resource&#39;s properties (assume those are resources too)? PUT\n&gt; &lt;properties&#39;s URL&gt; is one way, but as you said, the state overlap\n&gt; problem.\n\nThe overlap problem exists, but perhaps I have overstated it. It is a\ngenunine problem that developers must be aware of, but it can be worked\naround. A simple approach is to take care of the caching you allow\nclients to do. If you think that state may be altered due to changes to\nan overlapping resource you may indicate the state is non-cachable.\nAlternatively, you let users hit reload when they themselves see a\nproblem or you trigger a reload through the javascript or other content\nyou&#39;ve delivered them. In the worst case they&#39;re in the same position as\neveryone else on the Internet who doesn&#39;t know a change has occured.\n\n-- \nBenjamin Carlyle &lt;benjamincarlyle@...&gt;\n\n\n"}}
