But,\nlet&#39;s\n&gt; allow the programmers to add a few verb URLs in there when it makes sense.\n\nWhy wouldn&#39;t you POST what verb you&#39;re performing to the nouns?\n\nPOST /daemon HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/rpg+xml\n\n&lt;kill using=&#39;sword&#39; /&gt;\n\nThis way new verbs can be created without having to add sub-resources to\nevery noun on the server that can be affected by those verbs.
