Following links can only provide information to a\n&gt; client that would then change its own state. Each client could end in\n&gt; different states even though the hypermedia and resource \n&gt; representations\n&gt; were exactly the same for each.\n\nIf we&#39;re splitting hairs, then one bit difference constitutes clients\nin different states.  But do you feel that two clients as described\nabove could be in *significantly* different states having done the same\nGET and received the same representation?  I think not.  It does seem\nto depend, though, on what the client is caching along the way...Is\nthat your point?\n\nWalden\n\n"}}
