With an\n&gt; HTML client this would be easy, since then the HTML could cha=\r\nnge\n&gt; depending on these things. In my situation, where the client just get=\r\ns\n&gt; JSON-data, it seems to me that I have to extend my usage of JSON so  \n&gt;=\r\n that\n&gt; I can get both the data to view, and a list of what actions the cli=\r\nent\n&gt; is allowed to perform, and then enable/disable UI elements  \n&gt; accord=\r\ningly.\n&gt;\n&gt; Something like this would be sent from the server:\n&gt; {&quot;commands&quot;=\r\n:[&quot;cmd1&quot;,&quot;cmd2],&quot;data&quot;:{&quot;foo&quot;:&quot;bar&quot;}}\n&gt;\n&gt; With the above I can both get the=\r\n data I need to show, and know what  \n&gt; the\n&gt; user is allowed to do with it=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt; Has anyone done this? Or should I skip directly to XHTML instead and =\r\n \n&gt; use\n&gt; &lt;a&gt;&#39;s to let the client know what it can do? And if so, how would=\r\n the\n&gt; data be best transferred (key/value data)?\n&gt;\n&gt; Any tips would be app=\r\nreciated!\n&gt;\n&gt; /Rickard\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo=\r\n!
