It is nonsensical to argue that a WEBDAV\nbased web service would be as widely available as an RFC2616 service.\n\nIt&#39;s easy for a client to use DELETE. It&#39;s not easy for a client to\nuse MOVE.\n\n\n&gt; and am curious as to \n&gt; your statement regarding the advisability of using WebDAV (or other?) \n&gt; methods for REST applications. Could you elaborate more on this point? I \n&gt; won&#39;t discount the constraints that may be imposed by a given business, \n&gt; economic or political reality, but am for more interested in discussing \n&gt; the architectural and systems engineering constraints.\n\nWell, I think others have responded on the superflous nature of the\nWebDAV methods.\n\nBut let me make a few other bullet points:\n\n- REST is not just a widely agreed API, it is a _simple_ API\n- What does WEBDAV add that I can&#39;t explain in terms of HTTP?\n- there are risks in adding any method\n- it&#39;s very hard to explain the simplicity of REST (this is worth a\n  thread in itself)\n- it will be harder with people saying &quot;actually it&#39;s not as simple as\n  those people over there are saying&quot;\n\nThe last point is said in a kind of jokey spirit, please don&#39;t take it\ntoo hard.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
