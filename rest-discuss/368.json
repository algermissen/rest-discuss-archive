Something\n&gt; simpler than HTTP 1.1 would be more secure.\n\nI would be open to defining an explicit HTTP 1.1 profile. But by talking\nabout returning nothing, (in violation of the HTTP spec) you&#39;re going\nbeyond that. I agree with Jeff that we should design first, as if there\nwere no firewall and then figure out tunnelling later. \n\nThe tunnelling isn&#39;t rocket science and it has the virtue of putting the\nend-user into ultimate control. it can kill the pipe whenever it wants\nand the server no longer has a way to get in contact with it. That feels\nsafer to me. When the little &quot;tunnel&quot; icon is gone from my system tray I\ncan know that there is *no way* anybody could be talking to my box\nbecause it is invisible to the Web.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
