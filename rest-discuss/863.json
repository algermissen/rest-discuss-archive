My\ninterpretation of REST suggests that in order to PUT to a container,\nyou have to replace the entire state of the container.  So saying\n&quot;PUT &lt;40000&gt;&quot; to that URI is a mismatch.  It should be &quot;PUT &lt;40000,\n40000,40000,40000 ...&gt;&quot;.\n\nThis is a real brain teaser.  Clearly you can do it all over POST,\nby just posting the SQL statement (minus the where clause, since\nthat should be in the URI), but would that be considered tunneling?\n\nI&#39;m stumped, for now.  Anybody else got any ideas?\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
