I&#39;m talking about protecting the\n&gt; &gt;server.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was too.  So how do you distinguish?\n\nBoth sides can log all messages that were part of that transaction and\nif needed, use them to defend their position in a court of law.  So\nthere&#39;s existing protection from the sort of stuff you&#39;re asking about\n(fraud, etc..).\n\nThe application protocol contract provides a framework to enable the\nexchange of those messages to occur in the first place, without a\npre-existing trust relationship.\n\nThat didn&#39;t exactly answer your question above, but hopefully answers\nthe previous one.\n\n&gt; &gt;Hmm. I&#39;m not sure that there&#39;s any distinguishing to be done in that\n&gt; &gt;case.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, I guess I&#39;m arguing that POST is a contract that will have to be\n&gt; extended in a lot of cases in order to get the job done, and that if\n&gt; contract\n&gt; extension is regarded as risky, well then the camel&#39;s nose is under the\n&gt; tent.  I noticed in a previous mail you asserted that POST cannot be\n&gt; extended in a way that compromises intermediary security policy.  I don&#39;t\n&gt; know much about that, and an example of a contract extension would\n&gt; be great.  For that matter, any example of compromised security due\n&gt; to tunneling would be great, but I notice my invitations for stories\n&gt; going unanswered.  Probably too much effort...\n\nWell, a good example of tunneling would be IPP-over-HTTP.  The\napplication contract in effect there is IPP, not HTTP, but a firewall\nnot able to detect tunneling will think that it is HTTP.  IPP is\nstandardized, which is good - so people have looked at it and thought\nhard about ways in which it can be used to break itself.  But the\nvast majority of tunnelling has not benefitted from such study.  And\nindeed, the use of RPC whose existence is to promote billions of\napplication protocols, rather than the 10 or so we use now, is just\ndangerous.\n\n&gt; Anyway, one thing I think I&#39;ve figured out is that while I&#39;m visualizing\n&gt; a security setup in which the server has a lot of control (arguably enough,\n&gt; if it chooses to exploit it), you are probably looking at security\n&gt; as a (textbook) layered concept, and your concern is that an outer layer not\n&gt; be\n&gt; dismantled.  Correct me if I&#39;m wrong on that.\n\nThe characterization of my position sounds about right (assuming\n&quot;outer&quot; is where I think it is 8-).  But I&#39;m not sure about your\nposition.\n\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;m not sure where you&#39;re going with it, sorry.\n&gt; \n&gt; No doubt my fault.  [We were talking about my &#39;square&#39; example,\n&gt; in which I send &#39;square&#39; as a command in a POST body, and you find\n&gt; to be UnRestful. I was then proposing a number of different strategies\n&gt; for &#39;nounifying&#39; the command, in order to try to discover a boundary,\n&gt; if there exists one, between commands and command surrogates\n&gt; in the body, such that a Restless example becomes a Restful one.]\n&gt; \n&gt; In a recent message, Jeff Winters gives an example in which a\n&gt; &lt;transfer .../&gt; is posted.  The transfer is a document that contains\n&gt; the parameters for the transfer, but it&#39;s also due to become the\n&gt; record of the action.  How does that rate on your scale?\n\nI don&#39;t recall the example, but if its intent is to request specific\nbehaviour from the server, then it&#39;s low on my scale.\n\n&gt; &gt;Perhaps, but that &quot;block of data&quot; blurb is the most oft referenced\n&gt; &gt;part of the definition of POST that people use to defend tunneling,\n&gt; &gt;ala;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/draft-debry-http-usepost-00.txt\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;So I think it&#39;s useful that the examples are part/assembly, even if\n&gt; &gt;the IPP guys chose to ignore them. 8-)\n&gt; \n&gt; I wonder what the harm would be from removing that bullet from 2616,\n&gt; and I&#39;ve often pondered its strange relation to the other bullets, because\n&gt; it appears to be about a half a layer away in its semantics.  You can\n\nI suggested a replacement to the HTTP WG, but Roy likes it so it stays.\n\n&gt; achieve all the other goals by posting form data to a data-consuming\n&gt; process, can&#39;t you.\n\nRoy has a slightly more specific definition of &quot;posting form data&quot; than\nI do.  But yes, I see that as the most general description with the\nothers being special cases.\n\n&gt; But as far as tunneling goes, now I&#39;m not so sure that clause is the\n&gt; tunnel I thought it was before.  As long as what&#39;s being posted is &#39;data&#39;\n&gt; to the application and not &#39;control&#39;, then visibility is left intact, isn&#39;t\n&gt; it?\n\nYes.\n\n&gt; If visibility of actions is important, then why is it bad to put an action\n&gt; in the body of the HTTP message but okay to hide them behind &#39;processor&#39;\n&gt; URIs?  Especially when the URIs are going to be opaque in meaning to\n&gt; all but the server (i.e., intermediaries won&#39;t know what they mean either).\n\nRight, that&#39;s the point.  Any action that might be taken is only\nunderstood to be an action by the server.  To the client, it&#39;s just an\nidentifier like any other.\n\n&gt; Is this okay simply because you can annotate a resource with RDF,\n&gt; and thereby make the resource&#39;s behavior open to inquiring minds?\n\nHmm, no, I don&#39;t think so, if I understand what you mean.  It&#39;s just\nbecause the URI is opaque, and therefore invoking GET on it means GET to\nthe client.  Invoking &quot;buyShoes&quot; over POST means &quot;buyShoes&quot; to the\ninvoker.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;My eyes, me eyes! 8-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, what about URIs?
