I publicly =\r\nthank Glenn Block for his insight and ideas in the article. So that is the =\r\nfirst part of my request here, I know you all may have something to comment=\r\n :D\n\nThe second part of my request is regarding the second part of the arti=\r\ncle: After we have the model, we need to provide an evaluation of the curre=\r\nnt frameworks! That evaluation I did long ago and without the model. Now, I=\r\n do not use all the frameworks of course, so it will be great if some of yo=\r\nu may take a look at the model, then review the framework you most work wit=\r\nh or know, and let me know what level of support (based on the model) do yo=\r\nu think that framework offers. It will be great including all platforms, fr=\r\nom PHP tp Java, .NET, Ruby and any other scripting language around. Now, pl=\r\nease bear in mind this is not a competition, where higher level means that =\r\nframework wins. As stated in the article, even level 1 fully supports REST,=\r\n only the developer may need to do some extra work to get there. What we ar=\r\ne looking for is evaluating the frameworks in a way that helps the framewor=\r\nk makers and the users to identify the needs and solutions. It is like sugg=\r\nesting a tool and testing it in the field for tuning. \n\nThanks to all and I=\r\n&#39;ll appreciate any comment, be that here or in the article at DeveloperFusi=\r\non. Thanks a lot!\n\nWilliam Martinez.\nArticle Link: http://www.developerfusi=\r\non.com/article/141194/evaluating-rest-frameworks-part-1-a-maturity-model/\n\n=\r\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
