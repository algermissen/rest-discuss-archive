Probably we require the username and email-address of the\nuser to perfo=\r\nrm this operation.\n\nSo what is the best URL for such functionality?\n\nS.th. =\r\nlike POST /users/{username}/generatepassword with the\nemail-address somewhe=\r\nre in the body, and the newly generated password in\nthe response body?\n\nWe =\r\nalso want to provide update-password via\nPOST /users/{username}/password, w=\r\nith oldPassword, newPassword in the\nrequest body. As we have already a pass=\r\nword resource, would it be better\nthen to use POST .../password/generate to=\r\n generate a new password for\nthe user?\n\nOr, completely different, would it =\r\nbe better to use s.th. like\nPOST /pwdgenerator/users/username (with the ema=\r\nil address in the body)?\n\nThanx for suggestions in advance,\ncheers,\nMartin\n=\r\n\n\r\n--=-2Kk2BKOz9dMfz7i4UBta\r\nContent-Type: application/pgp-signature; name=signature.asc\r\nContent-Description: This is a digitally signed message part\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--=-2Kk2BKOz9dMfz7i4UBta--\r\n\n"}}
