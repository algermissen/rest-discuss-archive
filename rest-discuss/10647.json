The credit for realizing that personal , ever changing data\nshould be shown via set of entries interconnected via links, should go\nto them and not to REST.\n\nREST just says that using HATEOS as a constraint, you would induce\nsome very interesting properties in a network based application, not\nthe least of which is loose coupling.\n\nRegards\nDevdatta\n\n*again , see Nelson&#39;s paper! :)\n\nOn 18/04/2008, yadnem &lt;r.menday@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  Hi\n&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Hi\n&gt;  &gt; There is nothing RESTful about this.\n&gt;\n&gt;  my worst fears ... :)\n&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; REST is a style for network architecture.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Does it help the analogy if you pretend that the representations you\n&gt;  see are from some server somewhere ?\n&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; what you ARE seeing is hypermedia, which is hardly surprising... the\n&gt;  &gt; original intent for hypermedia WAS for such things.

Firstly it seems to have a uniform\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  interface. Furthermore, as I go through &#39;music-&gt;artists-&gt;elvis&#39;, etc\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  ... I am navigating links. This is &quot;connectedness&quot; as described in\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  RESTful Web Services. Actually, I would like to see more from the Pod\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  in this direction - for example, for the song I am currently\n&gt;  listening\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  to, it would be nice to see how this is linked into which playlist,\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  genre, etc. This would be going in the linked data direction.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  Furthermore, I believe I see a very nice example of the mysterious\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  hypermedia as the engine of application state, in, for example, the\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  stopwatch function of the ipod.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;                   \n\n"}}
