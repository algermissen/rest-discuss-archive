But the code uses an\n&gt;  HTML FORM convention to describe the entity; eg:\n&gt;\n&gt;  param1: value1\n&gt;    param2: value2\n&gt;\n&gt;  the entity is NOT a list of values. But the list of values contains\n&gt;  all the information needed to represent the entity (in other words,\n&gt;  it&#39;s that data, just in a different format).\n&gt;\n&gt;  I was trying to process the PUT request with the toolkit&#39;s standard\n&gt;  FORM processing tools. But it turns out those tools (in this\n&gt;  particular toolkit) limit FORM processing to only reqyests where the\n&gt;  method is POST.\n\nThis is Python, so doing that yourself shouldn&#39;t have taken more\nthan one line of code (http://docs.python.org/lib/node474.html).\n\n&gt;  I supplied a patch to the devs of the toolkit but they rejected it\n&gt;  saying that they did not consider it correct PUT behaviour.\n\nIf web framework developers were the final arbiters of what\nwas &quot;correct&quot; HTTP behaviour we&#39;d be doing everything over\nGET, whining about GWA[1], and trying to figure out ways\nhow to &quot;bust through the cache&quot;[2].\n\n[1] http://bitworking.org/news/I_m_sorry__I_can_t_kiss_it_and_make_it_better_\n[2] http://intertwingly.net/blog/2005/03/16/AJAX-Considered-Harmful\n\n   -joe\n\n-- \nJoe Gregorio        http://bitworking.org\n\n"}}
