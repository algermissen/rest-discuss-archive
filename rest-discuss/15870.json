IOW, the media type is not for =\r\n*this* application\n&gt;&gt; but for the domain (even if that is a rather loose te=\r\nrm :-).

However, &#39;standard&#39; in this sense means more\n&gt;&gt; &#39;applica=\r\ntion independent&#39; than &#39;IETF or W3C standard&#39;. It is ok if the\n&gt;&gt; media typ=\r\ne is only standard in you organisation. Important is that it\n&gt;&gt; is not defi=\r\nned by the service under development.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why is that important?\n\nIt is im=\r\nportant because we want to avoid defining new stuff for every new service. =\r\nThe overal media type (or small set of types) should ideally already provid=\r\ne what is necessary.\n\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; It seem a little too complex...\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Wh=\r\ny does this seem complex?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Is there some example of such a process w=\r\norked?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; HTML\n&gt;&gt; AtomPub\n&gt;&gt; OpenSearch\n&gt;&gt; NewsML (to some extend)\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Which result in semantic tunnelling. Look at the work involved in\n&gt; map=\r\nping gdata/activitystreams/odata into Atom or microformats/rdfa into\n&gt; HTML=\r\n. Those are global/community efforts that dwarf the caabilities of a\n&gt; time=\r\n-constrained business that needs to solve its problem rather than\n&gt; its ind=\r\nustry&#39;s problem. \n\nPersonally I have very ambivalent feelings towards exten=\r\nsions. I think they are to be used for incremental evolution of the media t=\r\nype. IOW, they allow for punctual experimentation and when they turn out to=\r\n be useful, they should flow back into the type.\n\nAt the very least, profil=\r\ne parameters should IMHO be used to make conneg explicit.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; What would=\r\n be &#39;wrong&#39; with with having a link to WADL in your media\n&gt; type?\n\nWhat wou=\r\nld that buy us? The fact that a client chooses to interact with a certain r=\r\nesource is something that happens at the &#39;intent&#39;-level. If the goal is to =\r\nsubmit an order, you turn to an order accepting resource, not just any reso=\r\nurce. This decision and HTTP standard semantics should usually be enough to=\r\n construct the request.\n\nCan you provide an example what WADL could describ=\r\ne at runtime that needs to be described?\n\n&gt; Until such a time as the RDF si=\r\nngularity that is, although frankly\n&gt; TDF looks more and more like a better=\r\n option than blocking the\n&gt; &#39;applications&#39; and the &#39;service under developme=\r\nnt&#39; on some non-existent\n&gt; &#39;standard&#39;.\n\nDo you think that in the case of At=\r\nomPub it would have been better to create an AtomService and have that serv=\r\nice define and own the format?\n\nJan\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Bill\n&gt; \n\n------------------------=\r\n-----------\n Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n NORD Software Consulting\n\n Mail: =\r\nalgermissen@...\n Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n Work: http://www.no=\r\nrdsc.com/\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
