If it&#39;s a problem for you then recreate the cache when the first\n&gt; entries come in (but keep an eye out for clients breaking in the\n&gt; interim when they get 404s).\n\nIf I receive a DELETE request, I will assume that the requester want\nthe specified resource to go away. But in this case, I don&#39;t think\nyou want to do away with the cache. Instead you simply want to\nreset its state.\n\nThe identifier /cache points to a compound resource which includes\nresources for individual cache entries. Affecting the state\nof the compound resource should affect the member resources&#39; as well.\n\nSo, having PUT /cache with empty representation delete the\nmember cache entry resources is entirely reasonable.\n\n\n&gt; In any case I don&#39;t follow how you figure that PUT makes any sense in\n&gt; this context.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sam\n\nIMO, using a DELETE to reset the resource&#39;s state seems overkill and\nwholly unnecessary. It resets the state in a round-about way.\n\nAlso, sometimes you want to keep some of the resource&#39;s internal\nstates because their usefulness extend beyond the flushing of the\ncache. For example, they could have been used to optimise performance\n(e.g. frequency table so it put popular key on a faster media).\n\nThe PUT approach won&#39;t have such problem because: \n- these attributes are internal (not in the exported representation)\n- outside agents can directly affect them since they won&#39;t know of the\nattributes&#39; existence\n- they are associated with the resource \n- the resource is not deleted and/or replace with some other resource\nthus, they remain.\n\nYS.\n\n"}}
