The most we can hope for is to ensure it\n&gt; isn&#39;t harmful to our goals. We may also find eventually that some of the\n&gt; extensions to SOAP are useful: security, routing?\n\nI&#39;d like to add some real world thoughts on this subject.  We are \ndeveloping an asynchronous communication system between a central system \nand many remote devices.  We have to deliver this product in an almost \nunreal timeline.  So we need to use technologies that can help us meet \nour goal quickly.\n\nI have, luckily, convinced everyone that using REST is the way to go. \nWe are transporting the state of objects across the network.  You won&#39;t \nsee a single method call in the communications.  (This has actually been \na huge blessing, I am a 100% believer in REST for distributed systems now)\n\nOur central system is written in Java, and the remote devices are all \nrunning a C++ application.  Our problem became, how do we efficiently \ndeal with parsing and unparsing these objects for both systems?  In \nJava, there are many XML mapping tools.  In C++, we had a hard time \nfinding libraries that would make the job of taking XML and making a C++ \nobject out of it.  I guess people just don&#39;t build distributed systems \nin C++ anymore. :)\n\nAnyway, I&#39;m getting to my point.  We needed some libraries to do \nautomatic marshalling of objects from the XML.  Guess what libraries do \nthat?  You got it:  SOAP.  SOAP libraries will take objects in your \nlanguage and serialize to XML, and back again.  And there are SOAP \nlibraries for C++ (we are using gSOAP with pretty good results).  We \nhave a single method call invoked via SOAP, sync(), that exchanges \nobjects wrapped in either a GET, PUT, or DELETE.  We are essentially \nemulating HTTP inside our objects being passed around with SOAP.\n\nSo Paul is right here.  Don&#39;t go around bashing SOAP because many people \nuse it in a IMHO doomed fashion.  SOAP libraries are very useful for \nobject marshalling/unmarshalling.  It has helped us connect two very \ndifferent systems, while remaining true to REST ideas.  Until we can \nfind a robust XML data binding library for C++ w/ network capabilities, \nwe&#39;ll stick with using SOAP for that.\n\nI agree with Paul in that our job now is to show people how to use SOAP \nin a RESTful way.  It can be done, as our product has shown how SOAP can \nbe very useful and not harmful.\n\nSeth\n\n\n"}}
