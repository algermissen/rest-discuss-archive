I espcially liked the www.my-home.org examples as an\napplication\n&gt; where action verbs are a much more natural way of modeling the system.\nFor me, those example are not &#39;natural&#39;, they are merely &#39;procedural&#39;. A\nnoun/object/resource based approach isn&#39;t any more natural either - it is\njust a different way to doing things and it has different characteristics.\nLet&#39;s follow this example through.\n\n1 Verb-oriented URLs\n&gt; For example, a program to control devices in my house might look like\nthis:\n&gt;\n&gt;    http://www.my-home.org/connect-to-central-computer\n&gt;    http://www.my-home.org/air-conditioning/on\n&gt;    http://www.my-home.org/air-conditioning/adjust-temp?value=68\n&gt;    http://www.my-home.org/stereo/on\n&gt;    http://www.my-home.org/stereo/play-cd?cd=Timeless-Serenity\n\nQuestion: by &#39;adjust-temp&#39; do you mean &#39;add 68 degrees&#39; or do you mean &#39;set\nequal to 68 degrees&#39;?\nQuestion: how do you get the current temperature or the current album?\n\nAdditional URLs might look like:\n   http://www.my-home.org/disconnect-from-the-central-computer\n   http://www.my-home.org/stereo/powerDown\n   http://www.my-home.org/stereo/play-cd?cd=none\n   http://www.my-home.org/air-conditioning/turnOffNow\n   http://www.my-home.org/air-conditioning/reportTemp\n\n\n2 Noun-oriented URLs\n&gt; For me it is more program friendly to have something like:\n&gt;  home.server = &quot;http://www.my-home.org/&quot;;\n&gt;  home.put(&quot;air-conditioning/power,&quot;on&quot;);\n&gt;  home.put(&quot;air-conditioning/temp&quot;,&quot;68&quot;);\n&gt;  home.put(&quot;stereo/power&quot;,&quot;on&quot;);\n&gt;  home.put(&quot;stereo/current-album&quot;,&quot;Timeless-Serenity&quot;);\n\n&gt; If you wanted api based access, it wouldn&#39;t be hard to define objects with\n&gt; named properties where each property maps to a URI. You could then have\nthe\n&gt; client do something like:\n&gt;  home.airConditioner.power = &quot;on&quot;;\n&gt;  home.airConditioner.temp = &quot;68&quot;;\n&gt;  home.stereo.power = &quot;on&quot;;\n&gt;  home.stereo.album = &quot;Timeless-Serenity&quot;;\n\n\n\n"}}
