If anything, D is the domain from which\nrepresentations are drawn and (D -&gt; D) represents the mapping of a\npre-state for a given resource to its post-state, and in that sense,\nthe &#39;return&#39; value of the function we&#39;re interested in means that\nthe function is defined as a pair\n\n\t(PUT | POST | DELETE) /foo &lt;representation&gt;\n\tGET /foo\n\nSo that the final get represents the function&#39;s value (i.e., the second\n&#39;D&#39; in the mapping from D -&gt; D).\n\nOther definitions of &#39;idempotent&#39; refer to things like recursive inclusion\nof C header files; not very enlightening.\n\nWalden\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Mark Baker [mailto:distobj@...]\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, September 03, 2002 1:50 PM\n&gt; To: Mark Baker\n&gt; Cc: Miles Sabin; rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] Idempotent sequences\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Actually, let me take that back. 8-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Let&#39;s say the example was;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;2&quot; &lt;= GET /foo\n&gt; PUT &quot;1&quot; /foo\n&gt; \n&gt; i.e. GET returns &quot;2&quot;, PUT sets value to &quot;1&quot;.
