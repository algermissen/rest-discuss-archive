The only reason I\nconsider POST is because if a person designs a web service without\nspecifically taking into a account either REST or XSLT that service is\nlikely to accept POST, not PUT. PUT isn&#39;t supported by either HTML or\nWSDL, so the GET/POST have become a popular pair!\n\nI suppose I would still end up going over to the PUT side because if\nXSLT will just ignore the result of the POST then it will be\nincompatible with may POST-based services anyhow.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
