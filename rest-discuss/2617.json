Some applications may care, and\n&gt; so we need to know if that contract was intended by 2616 or\n&gt; not.\n\nI would say the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, the client should be able to discover the\npre-state when using DELETE, but can ignore what it finds.  The reason I say\nthis is because 2616 already explicitly says this very thing about PUT (201,\nfollowed by 200).  The problem I see is that, unlike PUT, DELETE&#39;s spec\nleaves us guessing as to *which* response(s) to use.  The only thing I feel\nfor certain is that we should not send the same response when the pre-state\nis different between requests (e.g. 200 only), at least as far as DELETEs\nare concerned.\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
