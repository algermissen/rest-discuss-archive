No,\n&gt; it&#39;s not affected in its relational-ness.\n&gt; IMO a client can&#39;t make a service less RESTful by being naughty.\n\ni agree with this, but depending on how you as the service provider \ninform and support your clients, they might tend to use the service in a \nbetter or in a worse way. for example, if you document all the URI \npatterns you are currently exposing, just FYI and with giant note \nadvising consumers not not hardcode those patterns, clients will still \ndo that, and when they break, they will very loudly complain that your \nchange broke them. it didn&#39;t, but you will still have to deal with \nbroken clients and unhappy customers. so apart from the design and your \nability to design things well, i think it also is very important to make \nsure that clients understand what you&#39;re doing, and use the affordances \n(this one is for you, mike ;-) you provide them, instead of hacking \naround your actual model. i think an excellent way of doing this is to \nalways expose a browsable HTML version, even if it is very primitive and \nhas no UI design to it at all. ideally, just provide an XSLT and link \nthat to your XML API representations, so that browsers supporting \nclient-side transforms will allow developers to surf the API and \nunderstand the way in which it is supposed to be used.\n\ncheers,\n\ndret.\n\n-- \nerik wilde | mailto:dret@...  -  tel:+1-510-2061079 |\n            | UC Berkeley  -  School of Information (ISchool) |\n            | http://dret.net/netdret http://twitter.com/dret |\n\n"}}
