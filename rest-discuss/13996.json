Clearly, such descriptions are contrary to REST&#39;s  \nevolvability goals because any prescriptive information about the  \nserver limits its desired evolvability.\n\nWhile this is fine when the client has human or human-like  \ncapabilities to mediate between the overall client&#39;s intentions (e.g.  \n&#39;buying a book&#39;) and the actual runtime-discovered state machine of  \nthe application, problems do arise when the communication model is  \napplied to machine to machine interactions. Especially when REST is  \napplied in an enterprise context where budgets and legal issues are at  \nstake.\n\nThe problem is that an overall goal like &#39;buying a book&#39; must assume  \nthe availability of certain media types, extensions, links, etc. and  \ncertain available state transitions at certain points in the overall  \ninteraction. Without such assumptions it would be impossible to come  \nup with client side code that performs the overall goal.\n\nWith human clients the situation is actually quite the same but less  \nvisible because the human user is sort of in permanent browsing mode,  \nwalking the Web, discovering new things, etc. When underlying  \nexpectations fail (Ooops, where did that 1-Click link go?)  \ncompensating action can be taken. For example: call the hotline or  \nchange the online shop.\n\nOne can put some amount of flexibility into a machine client, but it  \nis inevitable that at some point assumptions end up in a place (source  \ncode, configuration) that will cause runtime failure when the  \nassumptions about the server turn out to be wrong.\n\nThis is not so much of a problem in contexts, where budget and legal  \nissues are of minor importance (e.g. when I do some fun-coding to  \ninteract with Amazon&#39;s APIs) but as soon as you pay serious amounts  \nfor the use of an API or when liability issues are involved things are  \ndifferent.\n\nWhat is necessary I think is a way to describe services that meets the  \nfollowing objectives:\n\n1. **Only** describe/define those aspects of the provided\n    service that constitute an inevitable coupling of\n    client and server anyway. For example: if a client\n    is programmed to use a search, the service provider\n    must assure that the search will remain available\n    during the agreed upon service lifetime.\n\n2. Use a means of description that is formal enough to\n    serve as the basis for legal contracts (e.g. SLAs).\n\n3. Make that means of description standard/mainstream\n    enough to avoid that everybody is forced to reinvent\n    the wheel[1]\n\n\nThese are the aspects I think should be addressed in such definitions:\n\n1. General client obligations\n    This section would cover the base set of media types,\n    link relations, etc. to be understood by the client.\n\n2. General server commitments\n    The description can be simplified and reduced if the\n    server makes general commitments such as &#39;resources\n    that are known by the client to be collections of items\n    will always at least be available as application/atom+xml\n\n3. General availability of certain state transitions\n    A search resource for example can be defined to be available\n    to the client independent of the current application state.\n    IOW, the search resource will always be &#39;announced&#39; as\n    part of the initial service documents or, if none are used\n    it would mean that the search would be available to the\n    client from any received response (e.g. via Link header)\n\n4. Availability of certain goals in certain application states\n    If a client does a search in an online shop there is an\n    expectation to being able to place an order afterwards.\n    Such an expectation would be backed up by this section. A\n    way to view this is as a dependency tree of goals (after\n    item search can come purchase).\n\n5. Availability of certain media types, link relations,\n    extensions There must be a means for the server to tell the\n    client which media types are available[2] and also a\n    commitment that these (or at least one) will remain in use\n    for a defined period of time.\n\n[1] This is AFAIU the major concern articulated by Steve Jones in 2nd  \nparagraph of &lt;http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/service-orientated-architecture/message/13909 \n &gt;\n(a discussion that is the origin of this post because he makes some  \nvalid points\nthere)\n\n[2] Sure, the client could determine this at design time by executing  \nthe service, but on the one hand, this does not provide the designer  \nwith a guaranteed exhaustive set of options (you never know what you  \ndid not see) and on the other hand this approach is not likely to be  \nhelpful when proposing a project to whoever assigns you the budget.\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------\nJan Algermissen\n\nMail: algermissen@...\nBlog: http://algermissen.blogspot.com/\nHome: http://www.jalgermissen.com\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n"}}
