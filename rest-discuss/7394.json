It&#39;s to avoid naming clashes\n&gt; &gt; between\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; built-in and custom URIs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I definitely wouldn&#39;t use something that requires encoding.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It doesn&#39;t. According to [1] (section 3.3), the &#39;@&#39; character is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; legal in the URI path and does not require escaping.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; [1] http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I didn&#39;t check rfc 2396, but rfc 3986 obsoletes it. Reading from \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Reserved Characters&quot; section[1] it appears that you should percent \n&gt; &gt; encode the &#39;@&#39;\n&gt; &gt; character, but I could be misreading. Can anyone on the \n&gt; list with more \n&gt; &gt; experience tell me if I&#39;m interpreting it incorrectly, and \n&gt; if so why?\n&gt; \n&gt; A URI generator should percent-encode reserved characters \n&gt; when they are not being used as delimiters, so that other \n&gt; layers that do use them as delimiters can treat them \n&gt; specially without misinterpreting normal data (e.g., a name \n&gt; that just happens to start with @ would be encoded, whereas \n&gt; the delimiter used by Dream would not).\n&gt; \n&gt; In other words, Dream is using a reserved character correctly.\n&gt; Whether or not @ is the best choice for that reserved \n&gt; character is a long story and probably depends on what URIs \n&gt; are allowed (some use @ in the path for other things) and \n&gt; whether or not it interfaces with XPath processing (which \n&gt; uses @ for attribute names).\n\nInteresting. Hmmm.  I&#39;m going to have to mull on that one a bit. Is it a\nbeing used as a delimiter because it denotes a special class of URLs? That\nwould not have occurred to me. I keep learning something new on this list\neveryday...\n\nThanks.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n\n\n\n"}}
