Do you know how many &quot;Agile Software Development&quot; shops\nthere are out there that think having a daily standup, &quot;iterations&quot;\n(even if they&#39;re 3 months), and &quot;no documentation&quot; means they&#39;re\n&quot;Agile&quot;?\n\nI don&#39;t think there&#39;s any way to avoid it.

Regardless of whether the issue is the ignorance of the\n&gt;&gt; developers, the social dynamics around buzzwords, the lack of managerial\n&gt;&gt; will to confront the false labeling, or some combination of the\n&gt;&gt; foregoing, the issue is social, not technical.\n&gt;\n&gt; I said the issue wasn&#39;t technical; thanks for agreeing.\n&gt;\n&gt; If this thing is going to use the term REST, I expect it to have\n&gt; something do with that term, instead of being in opposition to it.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; What would you suggest regarding other, similar falsehoods [2] in\n&gt;&gt; related projects?\n&gt;\n&gt; I have no suggestions for Tapestry.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bill\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
