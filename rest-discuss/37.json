For example, it fixes the issue of message lifetimes being out\nof synch with process lifetimes; it supports dynamically determined routing\npaths; forwarders know to retry over some fairly long interval; via POP it has\nstrong support for transient nodes; it has a reply-to header for activating\ncallbacks; implementations already handle much longer message lifetimes by\nwriting them to disk; it has POP3 to support the semantics of message stores; it\nhas a broad deployed base of forwarders and temporary storage depots.\n\n&gt; For the record, I&#39;m all for introducing asynchronous notifications into\n&gt; HTTP.  I&#39;ll just refrain from suggesting how it should be done until I\n&gt; understand what you&#39;re asking, lest I confuse things by introducing a\n&gt; solution too early.\n\nPlease do introduce and suggest.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
