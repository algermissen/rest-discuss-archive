Actually, in this model, the en=\r\ntries are the &quot;key&quot; resources and your &quot;content&quot; resources are linked from =\r\nthe entries. Even if you don&#39;t use Atom, you could use a model like this. A=\r\nrguably, an HTML-based wiki or content repository uses this model as well.\n=\r\n\nAndrew\n\n\n"}}
