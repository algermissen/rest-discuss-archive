The point of a DELETE is to remove that\n&gt;mapping, and the point of 404/410 is so that the server can signal that\n&gt;there are no representations left mapped to that URI.\n&gt;\n\nSending an ETag with a 410 response indicates that there is a 200 OK \nrepresentation available, how?  The 410 Gone status is hardly \noverridden by the presence of an ETag.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The purpose of the spec is to allow interoperability. If my\n&gt;&gt; implementation does not cause interoperability problems then I don&#39;t see\n&gt;&gt; where the spec has been violated, or needs to be changed to disallow\n&gt;&gt; what I have implemented.\n&gt;\n&gt;The same can be said about SOAP (I guess), so would you defend SOAP as well?\n&gt;\n\nI know nothing of SOAP, are you saying RFC 2616 needs to be altered to \ndisallow SOAP?  Why?  Does SOAP violate RFC 2616?\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;10.4.5 404 Not Found\n&gt;\n&gt;The server has not found anything matching the Request-URI....&quot;\n&gt;\n\nWhere does that say the 404 response itself can&#39;t have an ETag?  The \npresence of an ETag says nothing about the state of the resource, \nonly that the response body has an ETag.  You are very good at \nreiterating your same point, as if the more times you say the same \nthing the more wrong it makes me...\n\n&gt;\n&gt;It seems that you say that:\n&gt;\n&gt;- there&#39;s nothing here,\n&gt;\n\nRight, that is certainly implied by a 404 or a 410 response...\n\n&gt;\n&gt;- but it has a representation,\n&gt;\n\nNo, I say the representation of the 404 or 410 response is an entity, \nand entities may be tagged.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;- but if you ask for it, I&#39;ll not send it to you.\n&gt;\n\nIf you keep repeating the same request, you&#39;ll keep getting a 404 or \na 410 response, the presence of an ETag indicates that some other \nresponse is available, how?\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Sorry, doesn&#39;t compute.\n&gt;\n\nNor does your repeated assertion that, by the very presence of an ETag, \na 404 or a 410 response can be assumed to mean something besides &quot;Not \nFound&quot; or &quot;Gone&quot;.  Since a 410 Gone response is cacheable, shouldn&#39;t \nthe spec say something about only using Last-Modified and other headers, \nwhile avoiding ETag?  Your argument is that cache-control headers are \nnot allowed on cacheable 410 responses?  Why not?\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; OK, but only if you can justify why this restriction is needed despite\n&gt;&gt; the fact that no interoperability problems result if it is not met.\n&gt;\n&gt;I do not believe there&#39;ll be no interop problem. But besides that, the\n&gt;same could be said about a protocol that tunnels everything through\n&gt;POST, right?\n&gt;\n\nYet you have failed to explain just what problems will arise.  If a \nprotocol tunnels everything through POST, it violates RFC 2616 how?  \nWhy do we need to change the spec to disallow POST tunneling?  \nBecause to do so is un-RESTful?  HTTP is not REST, there are a wide \nvariety of possibilities not restricted by RFC 2616 -- like SOAP or \nPOST tunneling -- which interoperate just fine.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;OK, go on ignoring the definitions on 404 and 410.\n&gt;\n\nYou keep making claimes about 404 and 410 which are simply not in the \nspec, then you accuse me of ignoring the spec?  Strawman arguments \ndon&#39;t hold much water with me.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Oh well. That&#39;s when you invoke curl *twice*, and the second\n&gt;instantiation has no knowledge about what happened before.\n&gt;\n&gt;Things may look entirely different if you&#39;re using a HTTP stack that\n&gt;does have such a kind of memory.\n&gt;\n\nLook, I already said &quot;I stand corrected&quot; on the cacheability of a 410 \nresponse.  Did you not read that?  I must&#39;ve said it three times so \nfar.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;So an HTTP stack that internally implements a cache and does not forward\n&gt;a GET request to the origin server when it already has the answer is\n&gt;broken? If you really think so, I&#39;d recommend that your review the XHR\n&gt;working draft\n\nLook, I already said &quot;I stand corrected&quot; on the cacheability of a 410 \nresponse.  Did you not read that?  I must&#39;ve said it four times so \nfar.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Sorry? &lt;http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2616.html#rfc.section.10.4.11&gt;:\n&gt;\n\nLook, I already said &quot;I stand corrected&quot; on the cacheability of a 410 \nresponse.  Did you not read that?  I must&#39;ve said it five times so \nfar.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Unless it is, see above.\n&gt;\n\nLook, I already said &quot;I stand corrected&quot; on the cacheability of a 410 \nresponse.  Did you not read that?  I must&#39;ve said it six times so \nfar.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;As others have pointed out, the spec clearly says that a 410 response is\n&gt;cache able unless marked otherwise:\n&gt;\n\nLook, I already said &quot;I stand corrected&quot; on the cacheability of a 410 \nresponse.  Did you not read that?  I must&#39;ve said it seven times so \nfar.\n\nI wonder when anyone will acknowledge that I have admitted my error?\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
