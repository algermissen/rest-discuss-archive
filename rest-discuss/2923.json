He&#39;s a classic dug-in vested interest. I&#39;m \n&gt; struggling to keep this from getting any more personal than Dave has \n&gt; already made it. I don&#39;t believe that&#39;s how technical discussions \n&gt; should be conducted.\n\nPersonal is often Dave&#39;s style.\n\nI&#39;ve faced the wrath of Dave before, Paul.  Apparently, around &#39;97 or \nso, I was &quot;interfering&quot; with the fate of Apple Computer --- and Dave \ngave me what-for about it. And frankly, he was at least partially \nright:  Apple wasn&#39;t dead despite how much I or anybody else thought \notherwise.\n\nI keep hoping to bring him around on this one, because IME he&#39;s \nbrilliant...  just under- or mis-informed.  (And like, ahem, &quot;certain \nother people&quot; ;-) he can be quite vocal about it, and doesn&#39;t like \nbeing told he&#39;s under- or mis-informed. ;-)  And I figure if a hard \ncase like me deserved enough attention and education from e.g. Mark and \nRoy back when to bring me around, then Dave deserves at least as much.\n\nI just wish Dave would take some of his own medicine.  Every time this \ncomes up, he seems to forget that he&#39;s asked me the same question, and \ngot the same answer:  yes, I&#39;ve not only looked at XML-RPC, I&#39;ve used \nit, on more than one occasion and with more than one language binding.  \nI just wish he&#39;d apply the same diligence to trying to understand the \npoint of REST that the rest of us have, and that he would himself do \nre: REST the same thing that he encourages in others -wrt- \nunderstanding XML-RPC, etc.\n\njb\n\n\n"}}
