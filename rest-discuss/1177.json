The REST architectural style is orthogonal to whatever\n&gt; programming paradigm you prefer to develop in.\n\nI don&#39;t actually agree with this.  While it&#39;s true that any\ncomputationally complete facility can be used to express any other\nsimilar facility --- this is all about universality, etc. --- that\ndoesn&#39;t mean that they are all equivalent.  I can model functions as\nobjects;  I can model objects as functions; etc. etc. etc. &#39;til the cows\ncome home.  However, that&#39;s not a particularly useful observation: \nsimilarly, that&#39;s like saying that OOP is orthogonal to whatever\nprogramming language you happen to be using.  While it&#39;s true that you\ncan do OOP even in e.g. assembly, it sure ain&#39;t easy. ;-)\n\nMy point is that REST the architectural style may *be* or *imply* a\nparticular programming paradigm;  consideration of that issue has been\nparticularly helpful to me in understanding and quantifying certain\nthings about REST.\n\n&gt; &gt;    &quot;OOP is to CORBA as ??? is to the Web.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; OOP and CORBA are not related exlusively to all other programming paradigms\n&gt; or architectural styles. It&#39;s just as possible to develop a monolithic\n&gt; procedural API using CORBA as it is an object oriented one. The same goes\n&gt; for REST.\n\nI think you&#39;re missing something important, but can&#39;t quite put my\nfinger on how to explain it to you.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
