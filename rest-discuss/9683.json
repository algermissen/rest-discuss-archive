Where do I go \nfrom here? Is there any material on what to do, how to do it? The atom-pub \nIETF draft says only a few paras about what to do, (the small paragraph on \nExtending ATOM). Does anyone have any whitepaper/notes I could look into? I \nknow of a few simple hacks that could work but then it could go out of atom&#39;s \nrestful constraints. \n\nI have a few ideas but I am refraining from mentioning them , in a desperate \nattempt to hide my ignorance and inexperience.\n\n\nRegards,\ndev\n\n"}}
