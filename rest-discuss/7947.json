Atom travels \nover both, trivially for entries (feeds are more tied to HTTP than first \nmeets the eye). And being XML it&#39;s structurally closer to SOAP; so it&#39;s \nles of a cognitive leap than going back to MIME. Anyone strategically \ninvested in SOAP will be able to spin for Atom support to complement  a \nREST checkbox.\n\nThere are general problems with using XML as an envelope insofar as \nembedding payloads phsyically inside elements can result in all kinds of \nsuckage - look at the half-decade of back and forth that has resulted in \nmtom and the pita that xml dsig has proven to be. I&#39;m not sure \nMIME+octets isn&#39;t a superior packaging technology if packaging is what \nyou need.\n\n\n&quot;It&#39;s not much of an improvement over doc style SOAP. Just being RESTful \nisn&#39;t enough to encourage widespread adoption. Yay: there&#39;s no verb in \nthe message. Yay, they obey HTTP method semantics. Apart from that they\nboth wrap a document in an envelope. As long as servers and clients have \nto agree ahead of time on complete document semantics they&#39;re forcing \none another to lock in code at development time&quot;\n\nI see Hugh is beating up on APP again. Hopefully we&#39;ll see him on the WG \nfor last call &quot;adding future business value&quot;. The last part by the way \nabout complete document semantics simply isn&#39;t true if your document \nsemantics are based on model theoretic semantics - the agents \ncommunities have been slinging documents back and forth for years \nwithout been tied to runtimes. It&#39;s just that programming to a model \ntheory is esoteric compared to switch-on-type; programmers generally \nwon&#39;t roll with it.\n\nBut I&#39;ll say this - the first thing to do here is compare and contrast \nthe minimal Atom document with SOAP&#39;s before trashing Atom. I did the \nminimal SOAP envelope years ago and that strongly influenced a \nprofessional commitment not to deploy on it for clients.  Atom at least \nmakes you say something.\n\n\n  Atom is more like REST&#39;s\n&gt; (someone&#39;s?) alternative to RDF. \n\nRDF has characteristics that make it better than Atom (or any such \nXML/XHTML format) as an interlingua, but isn&#39;t quite structured enough \nas a format. That means to support RDF you tend to end up interfering \nwith backend application storage to support the flexibility (IME). You \ncan sink a lot of money doing that. Because Atom is less flexible it&#39;s \neasier to tie down wrt OO domain and relational backends. The only \nhighly generic thing you need to support across domain types are tags, \nand there are some decent many 2 many table models you can use for that now.\n\n\n&gt; That is to say, it compliments a\n&gt; growing family of standard document types that can be included in each\n&gt; other, and can be extended for domain-specific uses without inventing a\n&gt; whole new vocabulary.\n&gt; \n&gt; RDF builds an abstract metamodel and expects vocabularies to fill the\n&gt; rest of the gaps. Successful formats to date have taken a different\n&gt; approach of defining vocabulary and document structure together. \n\nI would add also that successful formats have left format semantics in \ncode rather than using declarative/model techniques. Elliotte has \nhistorically had a good basic stance on why this gets deployed over \nshared formal _models_.\n\n&gt; I see the aggregation and sub-classing features of XML as the core of\n&gt; the semantic web going forwards. I think this is a more fully-featured\n&gt; way of representing data than rigid RDF. \n\nI&#39;m not so sure. I think linking and tagging are the way forward, and \nthe person who persuades people to go with prefix conventions for tag \nlabels instead of full URIs as RDF/semweb does, will win. No-one uses \n&quot;dc:&quot; in XML for anything other than Dublin core.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
