The calling-it-REST part bugs me; the it-\nisn&#39;t-REST part doesn&#39;t.  In fact, it insures that anything built this\nway will be just as sluggish, and prone to fantastic security failures,\nas Facebook -- leaving plenty of room for a competitive upstart to beat\nthem at the social-networking game by virtue of a fast, robust and\nsecure REST architecture.\n\nAs an entrepreneur whose mantra is, &quot;Yes, you CAN compete with Google,&quot;\nthe only thing that *would* scare me, is if Google actually _were_ to\nadopt REST.  Same goes for Facebook.  What was the latest flaw?  The\nability to follow the private chats of anyone who&#39;s your &#39;friend&#39;?\nIMO, that particular flaw was the direct result of not being RESTful,\nbecause it&#39;s just not possible to foul things up that badly unless you\nhaven&#39;t properly identified your resources to begin with.
