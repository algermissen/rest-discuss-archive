There&#39;s\n&gt;such a thing as HTTP range requests:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; [1] http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.16\n&gt;&gt;&gt; [2] http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.35\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Depending on the nature of the resource, particularly if it&#39;s a binary\n&gt;media type instead of text, it may be preferable to use HTTP range requests\n&gt;in which case /bighugefile.bin never &gt;&gt; needs to be transferred to a client\n&gt;in its entirety, but may be manipulated remotely nonetheless. \n&gt;\n&gt;But doesn&#39;t that then violate a prinicple of REST as you just defined it?\n&gt;IOW, not making it wrong, just making it not REST?\n&gt;\n\nHmmm... what principle of REST did I define?  The issue raised was how to \ndeal with very large files without requiring them to be passed back and forth \nin their entirety, I offered two examples of how this could be done.  One \ninvolves assigning a URI to the fragment in question, and while that makes \nmore sense to me and seems to be in line with _other_ best-practice \nconventions, I don&#39;t believe one way is more RESTful than the other.\n\nReally, it depends on the media type involved.  My preferred method is just \nnot relevant to a large binary file, while an HTTP delta is.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
