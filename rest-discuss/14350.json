Instead, the media\n&gt;&gt; type tells the client either wh=\r\nat method to use (e.g., anchor implies\n&gt;&gt; GET) or how to determine the meth=\r\nod to use (e.g., form element says to\n&gt;&gt; look in method attribute). The cli=\r\nent should already know what the\n&gt;&gt; methods mean (they are universal) and h=\r\now to dereference a URI.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ... REST requires that hypertext be used t=\r\no make these\n&gt; instructions to the client explicit, so Atom Protocol has a =\r\nREST\n&gt; mismatch.\n\nI&#39;ve never seen such a requirement and it&#39;s not clear how=\r\n that\nresolves with Roy&#39;s comment below?\n\n&quot;HTTP operations are generic: the=\r\ny are allowed or not, per resource,\nbut they are always valid. Hypertext do=\r\nesn=92t usually tell you all the\noperations allowed on any given resource; =\r\nit tells you which operation\nto use for each potential transition.&quot;\n\n--tim\n=\r\n\n"}}
