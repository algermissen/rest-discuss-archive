If a group of similar\nservice providers (onl=\r\nine stores) can agree on the same out-of-band\ndocumentation, that state-eng=\r\nine client is now more valuable.\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\n\n\n\n\nOn Wed,=\r\n Dec 16, 2009 at 11:36, Jan Algermissen &lt;algermissen1971@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; On Dec 16, 2009, at 4:58 PM, mike amundsen wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Jan:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If I un=\r\nderstand your description, you are talking about creating a\n&gt;&gt; client that =\r\ncan search for helpdesk tickets (at some known URI, I\n&gt;&gt; assume) and, if on=\r\ne or more tickets come back in the response\n&gt;&gt; representation, are then abl=\r\ne to perform some action on the tickets\n&gt;&gt; (change status, etc).\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes. B=\r\nut it was really only meant as an example. The point is that\n&gt; the client m=\r\nakes assumptions about what comes back. It assumes it is\n&gt; e.g. a ticket (o=\r\nr an entry as in the case of AtomPub, or an order etc.).\n&gt; IOW: the client =\r\ndoes not simply assume the items are resources.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I think this can be=\r\n done by documenting a media-type constraint that\n&gt;&gt; includes information t=\r\no identify tickets.\n&gt;&gt; &lt;link href=3D&quot;....&quot; rel=3D&quot;http://www.example.org/re=\r\nls/ticket&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes. But when coding the client, you need to make use of =\r\nthe assumption that\n&gt; you should look for that rel and this comes down to t=\r\nhe assumption that the\n&gt; items in the collection are &#39;tickets&#39; (and not jus=\r\nt resources). You cannot\n&gt; code the client without knowing that you are goi=\r\nng to &#39;interact with&#39;\n&gt; tickets.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Alternately, a similar approach co=\r\nuld be used when the response\n&gt;&gt; representation includes more than just lin=\r\nks, but actual tickets.\n&gt;&gt; &lt;tickets&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =A0&lt;ticket&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0&lt;link href=3D=\r\n&quot;...&quot; rel=3D&quot;edit&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0...\n&gt;&gt; =A0&lt;/ticket&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;/tickets&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In =\r\nboth cases, the client can be coded to search the representation\n&gt;&gt; for the=\r\n proper elements and act accordingly.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes. But (see above) you code bas=\r\ned on the assumptions that such &#39;kinds&#39; of\n&gt; resources exist on the server.=\r\n When you have a human facing client it is\n&gt; different, because then you ju=\r\nst turn the links etc. found in the\n&gt; representations into buttons (e.g. [e=\r\ndit]) and let the human click on it. In\n&gt; these human driven interactions, =\r\nthe human makes the same kinds of\n&gt; assumptions (e.g. when I interact with =\r\nAmazon I assume I can select items\n&gt; and then order them) but the assumptio=\r\nns do not manifets themselves in code.\n&gt; For M2M clients they do and my poi=\r\nnt is that coding based on such\n&gt; assumptions is inevitably based on the se=\r\nrver describing what *kinds* of\n&gt; resource to expect.
