My follow-ups are:\n&gt; Would &quot;ArticleTag&quot; not be appropriate, or was your choice just arbitrary?\nMy choice was totally arbitrary.\n\n&gt; ... Was your use of XML for an\n&gt; example just habit, or are you advocating it over the request/response forms\n&gt; of  &quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot;/&quot;JSON&quot; that I discussed?\n My habit (sorry). JSON makes good sense if you plan on only doing\nthis via Ajax calls. FWIW, I would point out that JSON is really the\n*representation* of your ArticleTag resource. form-encoding is really\nanother representation of the same resource. XML, Atom, etc are just\nother representations. You might keep that in mind just in case -\nsomewhere down the road - you want to _represent_ your article tags\ndifferently.\n\n&gt; So I would PUT my option #1 (&quot;Just the tags the user wants assigned after\n&gt; they press submit&quot;), and I might also PATCH #2 (&quot;A list of changed tags&quot;)\n&gt; and POST #3 (&quot;All potential tags&quot;) if I really need those interactions?\nAgain, for me, PUT makes the most sense. I am not up-to-speed on\nPATCH, check out the specs and the archives for more\n(http://www3.tools.ietf.org/html/draft-dusseault-http-patch-10).\n\nFinally, I think of POST as a &#39;factory&#39; pattern. I use POST when I do\nnot have a &quot;document name&quot; and am expecting the server to supply one.\nI use PUT when I want to allow/require the *client* to select a\ndocument name:\n\nPUT /tags/my-tags (creates a resource named &quot;my-tags&quot; at the /tags/ location\nPOST /tags/ (creates a resource with a name created by the server\n(i.e. /tags/aXcd3)\n\nMikeA\n\nOn Dec 27, 2007 11:02 PM, Mike Schinkel &lt;mikeschinkel@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; mike amundsen wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Seems like this is all about how to &quot;tag&quot; one or more\n&gt; &gt; articles using a RESTful pattern.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yup, I think so.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I would consider defining a\n&gt; &gt; TagArticle resource\n&gt;\n&gt; Would &quot;ArticleTag&quot; not be appropriate, or was your choice just arbitrary?\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; that would look something like this:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;article id=&quot;{article-id}&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &lt;tag id=&quot;{tag1-id}&quot; /&gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &lt;tag id=&quot;{tag2-id&quot; /&gt;\n&gt; &gt;   ...\n&gt; &gt; &lt;/article&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This would then be used to inform the server of the tags that\n&gt; &gt; apply to a single article. you can GET, PUT, and DELETE this\n&gt; &gt; resource as you wish. You can use a Microformat approach (see\n&gt; &gt; the rel-tag spec) or even Atom as the mime-type for the document.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hmm.  I&#39;d *really* like to stay away from the complexity of having to pack\n&gt; into XML or HTML  and parse on both ends.
