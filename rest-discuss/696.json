The problem with this is that it implies a transaction. \n\nI don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to understand the rest until I understand\nthis sentence. Could you elaborate? Or was the rest of the paragraph\nelaboration?\n\n&gt; ...  In my former\n&gt; proposal on the subject I suggested that there be a GET, the GET results would\n&gt; be hashed by the client in some well known way, and the hash would be\n&gt; transmitted with the followup POST as a &quot;baseline state.&quot; \n\nRemind me of why this is necessary? Also, is there a motivation for not\nusing etags or timestamps or did you just not think of that?\n\n&gt; .... The subscription\n&gt; resource would decide when to fire a notification by computing its own hash of\n&gt; the watched resource and compare it to the hash sent by the client. \n\nThat&#39;s not how I see it. The subscription resource knows when the\nresource changes. By definition all clients are out of date. Why keep a\nper-client hash?\n\n&gt; ... However the\n&gt; hash has to be up to the server, since GET headers often imply a view of the\n&gt; object.  (By &quot;view&quot; I mean a transformation that is orthogonal to the underlying\n&gt; content of the object.  For example the GET may have &quot;Accept: XML-2.0&quot;, while\n&gt; the base resource exists in a neutral form like a unix mbox file.)\n\nXML is specific and mbox is neutral? Okay, whatever. ;)\n\nAnyhow, the terminology that we&#39;ve been using is representation (for\nyour &quot;view&quot;) versus resource (for your &quot;object&quot;).\n\nI don&#39;t understand how any of this is necessary yet, though....\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
