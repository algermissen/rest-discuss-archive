Bowman&quot; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry, not PUT, I was thinking about something else.  But there is a\n&gt; minor REST mismatch in AtomPub regarding DELETE not being hypertext-\n&gt; driven, an obvious coupling of client to server.  But, as a small\n&gt; portion of an overall REST system, not enough to claim failure to\n&gt; apply the hypertext constraint -- just a nitpick.  While Atom Protocol\n&gt; doesn&#39;t specify the behavior of DELETE on a collection, this\n&gt; disclaimer still scopes DELETE to any resource with an Atom\n&gt; representation.\n&gt; \n\nGoing a bit OT:\n\nI keep forgetting that I wrote a minimally-featured Atom Protocol\nclient using Xforms, to address this REST mismatch.  An Xforms REST\napplication follows the MVC architectural style on the client.  An\nXHTML interface is provided, which takes an Atom collection feed and\ndisplays it as one big Xform allowing individual entries to be added,\nedited or removed by directly manipulating the Atom resources,\ndepending on user role as provided by HTTP-Digest.  A form button may\nbe added to any individual entry, which will call its DELETE method,\nmeeting the hypertext constraint that eludes other Atom Protocol\nimplementations.\n\nPart of the Xform allows the collection to be deleted in one of three\nways:  DELETE all members, DELETE the collection but not its members, or\nDELETE all members and then DELETE the collection.  While having a\ncollection-targeted DELETE silently remove all member resources of the\ncollection, then remove the collection resource, has the &quot;Roy stamp of\napproval&quot; I do not wish to go that route here. My way is visible,\nbecause batch deletion occurs as separate DELETE requests to each\nmember resource.\n\nThe three interface options for deleting a collection are self-\ndocumenting via hypertext -- it&#39;s intuitive from the Xforms interface\ndescription in the &lt;head&gt; that a DELETE on a collection URL will not\ntrigger the deletion of member resources, because that option loops\nthrough every member with an individual DELETE both ways it&#39;s called,\nand a trial collection DELETE will confirm this when followup HEAD\nrequests made on collection members return 200 OK.  No human- or\nmachine-language interface description is needed.\n\nSo my client extends Atom Protocol by self-describing the unspecified\nbehavior of DELETE on a collection, in two different user-selectable\nways, using hypertext to drive application state and avoiding Atom\nProtocol&#39;s REST mismatch on DELETE for both collections and member\nresources.  Client and server are now decoupled, and may evolve\nindependently.\n\nServer collection-deletion options may be changed by updating the\nhypertext.  The client, in this case an Xforms-compatible browser, is\nfree to evolve independently since it isn&#39;t required to have any button\nin the chrome to handle deleting an Atom collection (or member).  It\nonly needs to know how to interpret Xforms, not Atom or Atom Protocol.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
