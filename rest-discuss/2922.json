REST is typified by HTTP/URI and SOA\n&gt; is typified by UDDI/WSDL/SOAP.  I&#39;m not exactly sure where XML-RPC fits\n&gt; in to this mix, probably in place of SOAP in the SOA stack.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think this would be a useful comparison to make.  I&#39;ve tried to broach\n&gt; this subject on the rest-discuss list before, but got slammed pretty\n&gt; hard because of the understandably REST-oriented view of the list.\nI&#39;m sorry you got slammed - that really isn&#39;t appropriate for a discussion\ngroup like rest-discuss.\nAre you willing to try again? I&#39;ll review the old posts & see what the\nattitude was like - but for me, I would appreciate comparisons between REST\nand other architectural styles.\n\n"}}
