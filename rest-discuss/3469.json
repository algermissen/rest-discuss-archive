Somehow, we&#39;ve ending up \ntalking about capabilities-based security, which you have already \nindicated isn&#39;t really the best choice for the majority of what&#39;s on the \nweb today.\n\nI think part of the problem I have is that with a capability model, it \nseems that you end up with everyone having their own private web of \nresources rather than having a public web of resources that are sharable \nwith others.  As a result, you&#39;ve lost the ability for people to connect \nthose resources together in new ways to create new things on the web.\n\nDon&#39;t get me wrong - I think the capabilities model is interesting and \nhas a place.  Something tells me it might line up well with &quot;hypermedia \nas the engine of application state&quot;, but I haven&#39;t thought about enough yet.\n\nOther comments below...\n\nTyler Close wrote:\n\n&gt;On Monday 03 March 2003 17:31, S.

ACLs are difficult to manage and open you\n&gt;up to all sorts of subtle security vulnerabilities. If you&#39;ve ever\n&gt;written code that uses ACLs, chances are you&#39;ve written code that\n&gt;is vulnerable to a Confused Deputy attack.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;If I am looking at a page with my January\n&gt;&gt;bank account history, I would like some way to\n&gt;&gt;navigate back to the main menu....\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;There are solutions to this, but first I&#39;ll point out that this\n&gt;issue doesn&#39;t apply to software programs.  &quot;Web services&quot; address\n&gt;program to program communication. Programs have a stack and a heap\n&gt;to help them keep track of what they&#39;ve got and what they&#39;re\n&gt;doing. A program doesn&#39;t &quot;navigate back&quot;, it just dereferences a\n&gt;variable.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI&#39;m not sure I&#39;d agree that &quot;web services&quot; is about program to program \ncommunication.  I&#39;m sure there are a lot of &quot;web services&quot; where there&#39;s \nonly a program at one end and some things that look like documents or \ndocument processors at the other end.  &quot;Program-to-program \ncommunication&quot; the way you  seem to be using it sounds a lot like an RPC \nmodel to me, and in my mind REST and RPC don&#39;t mix.\n\n&gt;It&#39;s also easy to implement &quot;navigate back&quot; from within a web\n&gt;browser interface to the application. The simplest answer is just:\n&gt;&quot;Use the &#39;back&#39; button to navigate &#39;back&#39;.&quot;. \n&gt;\n\nThis is an example of poor usability.  If I&#39;m in the middle of a \nhierarchy, you better not make me hit the back button 50 times to get \nback to the home page (or whatever the starting point is).  Further, \nwhat if I&#39;ve got that page bookmarked?  I never came in through the \nfront page, so no amount of hitting the back button is going to get me \nthere.  \n\n&gt;A step up from there\n&gt;is using frames. You can keep your main menu in a small frame\n&gt;along the left or top of the screen. The main menu is then always\n&gt;accessible to the user. If you don&#39;t like frames, you can use XSLT\n&gt;to build a composite page on the server. The XSLT code can suck in\n&gt;XML from a variety of capability URLs and then display a composite\n&gt;page that includes navigation tools.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;Everything really is at your fingertips. Having the security model\n&gt;integrated right into the programming model really simplifies\n&gt;things. Imagine building an application that aggregates\n&gt;information from a bunch of different applications. With a\n&gt;capability-based security model, you just suck in the XML and do\n&gt;your thing. In an ACL model, you&#39;ve got the additional headache of\n&gt;managing credentials and authentication protocols with each\n&gt;different application.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nSo how do you establish an initial context (or whatever its called) in a \ncapability-based system without doing authentication?\n\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;If I am the WSJ, how do I restrict access while\n&gt;&gt;at the same time allow users to refer to the same\n&gt;&gt;document?\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;You were the one who suggested this design, not me. This is now\n&gt;the third time that I have said that this is a bad idea. You would\n&gt;not use the capability model to solve this problem.\n&gt;\nI&#39;m not disagreeing, but how about giving an example of something \n(web-based) that you would use a capability model to solve.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;There&#39;s a long explanation that I could go into on this, but I&#39;ll\n&gt;just give you the punch line. The WSJ scenario is *not* an access\n&gt;control problem, it is a DRM (Digital Restrictions Management)\n&gt;problem. The capability model is used for solving access control\n&gt;problems, not DRM problems.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nWell, you may just have go into your long explanation, because if DRM \nisn&#39;t about controlling access, then I&#39;m pretty confused.\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n\n"}}
