Bowman wrote:\n&gt; Jï¿½rn Wildt wrote:\n&gt;&gt; One of the reasons for turning to REST is simplicity. By adding\n&gt;&gt; layers of RDFa onto HTML the API becomes more difficult to consume\n&gt;&gt; compared to a straight forward XML format. If I present a REST API to\n&gt;&gt; my customers that makes it (a lot) more difficult to consume than a\n&gt;&gt; SOAP API then I loose some of my selling points.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; What I&#39;ve been trying to explain, is that RDFa exists separately from\n&gt; the REST API.  Complexity ensues when the solution to m2m is the\n&gt; creation of custom media types bound to the nature of the data -- REST\n&gt; says it&#39;s simpler to use a generic media type, and solve m2m at another\n&gt; layer.\n\nIndeed, do see \nhttp://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven#comment-754 \nfor more on this, here&#39;s a snippet:\n\n&quot;When representations are provided in hypertext form with typed \nrelations (using microformats of HTML, RDF in N3 or XML, or even SVG), \nthen automated agents can traverse these applications almost as well as \nany human. There are plenty of examples in the linked data communities. \nMore important to me is that the same design reflects good human-Web \ndesign, and thus we can design the protocols to support both machine and \nhuman-driven applications by following the same architectural style.&quot;\n\nThat list would include RDFa now, and RDF in N3 is quoted specifically \nover other RDF formats because RDF in N3 has basic hypermedia semantics, \nin that it&#39;s the only (current) RDF representation other than RDFa to \nspecifically mention dereferencing URIs.\n\n&gt; The point of REST is that the &quot;ease of consumption&quot; isn&#39;t tied to the\n&gt; application stack, like SOAP is -- do SOAP solutions work in general,\n&gt; or do they only work for the particular vendor stack they target?  I\n&gt; suppose &quot;ease of consumption&quot; is a selling point, but only for coupling.\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I am probably wrong though - I do not think Fieldings thesis says\n&gt;&gt; anything about being simple, but that certainly is part of the\n&gt;&gt; percived goodness of REST amongst most people.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; The thesis defines simplicity here:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/net_app_arch.htm#sec_2_3_3\n\nNot often one see&#39;s a quote from the other chapters of the dissertation \nround these parts ;) good to see one at last!\n\nBest,\n\nNathan\n\n\n"}}
