However, is it even possible with how browsers are\nimplemented today.\n\nConsider the following HTTP Accept declaration from a browser.\n\nAccept:text/xml,application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,\ntext/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,image/png,*/*;q=0.5\n\nThe browser prefers the following content:\n1) text/xml,\n2) application/xml,\n3) application/xhtml+x,\n4) image/png\n5) text/html;q=0.9\n6) text/plain;q=0.8\n7) */*;q=0.5\n\nIf I am reading this correctly, it means that the browser prefers XML\nto an HTML page.  Is this not incorrect?  Let&#39;s say I write a REST\nservice and make it compatible with both a browser and XML client, the\nbrowser will always get the wrong content namely XML.\n\nIs this a correct interpretation of the Accept header?\n\nThanks\n\nChristian Gross\n\n\n\n"}}
