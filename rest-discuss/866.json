I&#39;ve never seen Tim B-L, Fielding,\netc. propose that random numbers would be better than human readable\nstrings.\n\nAs far as Construcability, you say:\n\n&quot;A listing of /proc would reveal a set of directories represented\nprocesses, each named by the PID of the process they are associated\nwith.&quot;\n\nThat&#39;s just the point!!! Given /proc, a computer program should navigate\nto processes by looking at the *listing* (the entity body) rather than\nguessing PIDs! That&#39;s using &quot;hypertext (links) as the engine of\napplication state&quot;.\n\nYou say:\n\n&quot;Reading the n/status file yields the current status of the process,\nwhile writing to n/ctl would send a message to the process, etc.&quot;\n\nOn the web, we would use strongly typed hyperlinks so that the name\n&quot;status&quot; or &quot;mem&quot; would be irrelevant:\n\n&lt;status href=&quot;status&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;mem href=&quot;mem&quot;/&gt;\n\nAnd here&#39;s where the power comes in...\n\n&lt;status href=&quot;http://www.some.other.site.com/status&quot;/&gt;\n\nIn a file system you could do that with a symlink. Symlinks (redirects)\nare a pain to maintain and computational expensive on the Web so it\nmakes more sense to use strongly typed links.\n\nOpacity is freedom. Renounce your heresy!\n\n&quot;Web archiving is one example where computability of URI is useful and\nimportant.&quot; Well that&#39;s what query parameters are for. There is an\nexception to URI opacity in the web architecture already. \n\nSo I&#39;m sorry but I don&#39;t see much to reconsider in opacity. URIs should\nbe human readable and guessable. Yes, but that isn&#39;t in conflict with\nthe opacity principle. URIs should sometimes be constructable from a\nbase and parameters (though probably not deconstructable). Yes, but that\nisn&#39;t in conflict with the opacity principle. I still think it is a big\nmistake for *programs* to either deconstruct or guess URIs.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
