But repr=\r\nesentations are just serialized &quot;data&quot; with no links\n- meets client-server,=\r\n layered system, caching, stateless (usually -- some stray here via cookies=\r\n etc.), identification of resources, manipulation of resources through repr=\r\nesentations\n- partially meets self-descriptive messages in that HTTP meta-d=\r\nata is used properly but a non-standard media-type or &quot;generic&quot; media type =\r\n(XML, JSON) or otherwise &quot;anemic&quot; format is used\n\nResource Oriented\n-------=\r\n----------\nLike Unlinked Resource Oriented but with links in the data.\n- th=\r\nis is tricky on the constraints met. Meets the same constraints as above; s=\r\nelf-descriptive messages still not met because of non-standard or generic f=\r\normat. Arguably only partially meets HATEOAS even though there are links.\n\n=\r\nThe distinction between &quot;Resource Oriented&quot; and REST is subtle. This is bas=\r\nically many of the APIs out there that miss the mark in media type design. =\r\nYes there are links, and so the client is still decoupled from the URI layo=\r\nut, but the client is bound to details of the service in other ways Roy out=\r\nlines in his &quot;REST APIs must by hypertext-driven&quot; blog posting. The result =\r\nis that you still have clients that are still very coupled to the service a=\r\ns the media type does not enable the client to be driven without other out-=\r\nof-band info. In short, you can&#39;t just throw URIs into arbitrary JSON and g=\r\net hypermedia (though that is what you often see in this style).\n\nAnyways, =\r\nthat was what I came up with. It&#39;s not quite 3 out of 4 of the interface co=\r\nnstraints style you propose -- I actually can&#39;t say that I see that too oft=\r\nen. I would define that as an API where the representation is in a well def=\r\nined, standard format that is not hypermedia -- what is a good example of t=\r\nhis kind of format (that is used in APIs)?\nRegards,\n\nAndrew\n\n--- In rest-di=\r\nscuss@yahoogroups.com, Jan Algermissen &lt;algermissen1971@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Giv=\r\nen that the creation of APIs that ignore the hypermedia constraint is unden=\r\niably an ongoing activity wouldn&#39;t it be nice to give those a name in order=\r\n to differentiate them from RESTful APIs?\n&gt; \n&gt; I think that it can in vario=\r\nus circumstances be argued to be to have HTTP based APIs that define some U=\r\nRI layout and maybe only use generic media types.
