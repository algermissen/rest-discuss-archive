(Assuming that the defined processing expectation is\n&gt;&gt; &#39;look at that order and let me know if you will fullfill it or not.\n&gt;\n&gt; application/order is an illegal media type, b/c it is not registered  \n&gt; by IANA.\n&gt;\n&gt; you want something like:\n&gt;\n&gt; application/vnd.rest-discuss.order\n\nSure - application/order was simply an example.\n\n&gt; Although I can see use cases for an order media type and such stuff,  \n&gt; this is not how I do things.\n\nWell, I am focussing on applying REST to machine to machine scenarios  \nand you cannot really get very far with the media types from the human  \nWeb. When there are no humans involved to solve the last semantic  \nlayer your media types just have to be a bit more expressive.\n\nThis does not mean that you need media types for every domain class  \nyou come accross. Rather, we will IMHO need media types that enable  \nsome core collaboration patterns (e.g. order acceptance).\n\n&gt; Where have you seen such examples?\n\nNot of the detail application/order. OTH, if the UBL was not intended  \nas a pure message passing format but would go about and define its own  \nmedia types we would be pretty close. UBL has the whole order- \nacceptance collaboration well defined and minting a set of media types  \nfrom that would not be a problem, IMHO.\n\nNewsML2 (it is has a media type) contains a contract  \n(publicationStatus) between sender and receiver through which the  \nsender can control the publishing state of a news item by the  \nreceiver. So, a resource that accepts NewsML2 implicitly agrees to  \nthis contract.\n\nIt will take a while, but hopefully we are getting there.\n\nJan\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
