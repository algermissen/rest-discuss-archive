Or conversely, if I have a name that I don&#39;t want \n&gt;&gt;to be dereferenced, then I shouldn&#39;t use a URI with a dereferencable \n&gt;&gt;scheme.  Personally, I don&#39;t understand the problem - a name is a name. \n&gt;&gt;Some will dereference, other will not.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;And this goes to the heart of my problem with this approach: one of the\n&gt;fundamental ideas behind REST is that a URL is transferrable from one medium\n&gt;to the next, and no matter where you find it you know (a) it&#39;s a URL and (b)\n&gt;you can use the HTTP verbs against it.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI think you have some terminology confused here.  REST as an \narchitectural style has no concept of URI/URLs; it only talks about \nidentifiers.   The &#39;fundamental idea&#39; you talk of above is related to \nthe Web, not REST.  \n\nWhen we say that the web is an implementation of REST, dont make the \nmistake of thinking of the relationship between REST and the Web as one \nof superclass/subclass.  The Web is not a subclass of REST.  The Web can \nbe classified as a RESTful (more or less) application - just like some \nother application might be classified as a client-server application.\n\n&gt;OK, maybe I should qualify that by saying &quot;HTTP URLs&quot; -- maybe that will\n&gt;clear this up a bit, since URLs don&#39;t have to have just an HTTP scheme.\n&gt;\n&gt;Now, having clarified it as HTTP URLs, let&#39;s ask the question again: Why\n&gt;would I ever want a URL *which specifies an HTTP scheme* to never be\n&gt;dereferenced? \n&gt;\nYou&#39;re not the only one to ask that question.  There&#39;s been a lot of \ndebate on this in the W3C TAG and other places. See the thread that \nstarts at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2002Oct/0118.html \nfor just one instance of this discussion\n\nPersonally, I have no problem using URIs as simple identifiers \n(dereferencable or not).  A name is a name.  Names exist outside of the \nWeb and outside of REST.  The URI spec provides a nice set of rules for \nthe syntax to use when constructing names.  Since part of the name is \nthe scheme, I&#39;d just as soon use an existing scheme rather than invent \nyet another scheme.  And if I&#39;m going to use an existing scheme, I&#39;ll \nstick with http.  \n\n&gt;It seems to fly in the face of the philosophy that, given a\n&gt;URL, I can at least GET it and probably use the other verbs as well. In\n&gt;other words, it seems very REST-less.\n&gt;\nThere&#39;s nothing stopping you from trying to GET any http URI you want \nto.  Note, however, the web makes no guarantee that the GET operation \nwill actually succeed.  And don&#39;t forget, some resources may only \nrespond to a POST. Or you may have a URI for a resource that doesnt \nexist anymore or that hasnt been created yet.  So even if you presume \nthat http URIs are meant to be dereferenced, there&#39;s nothing in the \narchitecture of the Web that guarantees that you&#39;ll get anything useful \nwhen you do so.\n\n&gt;I can see a use for non-dereferencable (is that a word?) URI/Ls (even those\n&gt;specifying an HTTP scheme), i.e. as unique names in RDF and such, but why\n&gt;would I ever need such constructs under REST?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Why isnt a chunk \n&gt;&gt;of metadata for a resource just another resource?\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;But if it&#39;s a resource, then mustn&#39;t it be available under REST? Maybe I&#39;m\n&gt;barking up the wrong tree here, if so please let me know so I can get it\n&gt;right.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re asking here.  I was just pointing out that I \ndon&#39;t see a need to try to create two different worlds - one for \nresources and one for metadata.  It seems to me that metadata about some \nresource is itself a resource, so why cant we just handle metadata the \nsame way we handle any other resource.\n\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n\n"}}
