PUT is a PUT is a PUT, and DELETE is a DELETE is a DELETE -- \n&gt; their semantics must not vary by resource or we&#39;ll be in for a world of \n&gt; hurt. (POST, of course, being the well defined exception to the above by \n&gt; design.) The heart of the matter is really one of providing a /uniform \n&gt; interface/ for web resources... an interface that has a well defined \n&gt; semantics for methods, independant of the resources they are applied to.\n\nThat is exactly the discussion point. How to interpret a DELETE on a\ncomposed object? especialy if it is identified by a query string.\nIn a hierarchical layout, the folder/file analogy can lead to the\ndeletion of the container and the sub-resources. But if the component is\ndynamicaly build from a query, it is not clear what to delete.\nAFAIK, the spec. don&#39;t give clue about the deletion of\ncontainers/subresources. Maybe in Dav spec. Have to check.\n\n\n&gt; [...] resources as distributed objects [...] is the whole \n&gt; point...\n\nSo, the client have to know if the container resource is a composition,\na collection, an aggregation... (to use OO terminology) to kown the\nbehaviour of a DELETE on such a resouce. The resource itself should no\nmore be accessible, but if subresources had theire hown URI, should they\nstill be available or not ?\n\n"}}
