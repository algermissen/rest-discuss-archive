These have been around\nfor a *long* time.  I don&#39;t know if it was precisely these 8 fallacies, but he&#39;s (Peter&#39;s) been\ntalking about this stuff at least since the time when I was at Sun, over a decade ago.\n\nLet me add a big lesson that most people fail to take away from those fallacies:\n\n* Disconnection is the edge case of latency\n\nAt some fundamental level, almost all distributed applications assume that two parties in an\ninteraction are going to be online at the same time;  this is a safe assumption only for\napplications where it&#39;s acceptable for the interaction to not occur at all if this doesn&#39;t\nhappen.  We pretend that most applications are like that, but indeed many applications would be\nmore useful if this wasn&#39;t the case, if I could *eventually* get the results I want regardless of\nthe connected status of the participants at any given time.\n\nAs our world becomes more mobile, people and devices become disconnected more frequently.  Despite\nthe drive to ubiquitous connectivity, it&#39;s safe to assume that the extreme edges of the network\nwill *always* be much lower bandwidth and much higher latency than the central parts, with the\nextreme case approaching 0 and infinity respectively.  It&#39;s a shame that more people don&#39;t build\ndistributed systems that recognize this fact, degrade gracefully as bandwidth drops and latency\nincreases, and allow participants to continue when disconnected with a guarantee of eventual\nconsistency upon reconnection.  (This is particularly a beef of mine with most distributed\nfilesystems.)  This distinction from typical distributed systems is so important that back in the\nearly 90s I started calling such systems &quot;dispersed systems&quot; or &quot;dispersed computing.&quot;  That&#39;s one\npiece of bonejargon that never really took;  hey, even Babe Ruth never batted 1000. ;-)  There are\nsome Google hits, but they&#39;re rather semantically unrelated.\n\n----\n\nThis need for looser coupling in time and with respect to instantaneous connectivity would seem to\nargue for asynchrony in a very strong sense --- and it does.  Alex will interpret this to mean\nthat SMTP is better or more powerful in some sense than HTTP --- but he&#39;s wrong. ;-)\n\nSMTP is a *synchronous* protocol, just like HTTP.  The asynchronous, store-and-forward behavior of\nSMTP arises at the architectural and application level.  Each transmission of a message between\none party and another results from a TCP connection between the parties over which a synchronous\nprotocol is run to pass the message in question (request) and get back a response.  It&#39;s even more\nsynchronous than HTTP in many ways;  a single message requires a stateful series of synchronous\ncommand-response interactions.  Certainly more chatty, more stateful, more difficult to implement,\nmore bletcherous on many levels.\n\nSMTP&#39;s asynchrony --- and that&#39;s not even really the right word, at an application level it&#39;s\nunidirectional in the success case --- arises as application-level semantics from a series of\nsynchronous interactions between entities that are tightly coupled in time.  There&#39;s no reason\nwhatsoever why SMTP as a protocol is better than HTTP as a protocol for this purpose;  the primary\nadvantage is that SMTP servers already understand routing and store-and-forward and have\ninfrastructure in place to support this.\n\n----\n\nMore musings...\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
