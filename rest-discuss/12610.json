The returned representation could provide\nlinks to potential recipients, or could indicate that the award has\nalready been given.\nAssuming that possible recipients are returned, these links could be\nrendered on the client as potential drop zones.  Dropping the award\ncould POST to a subresource of the recipient.  Something like POST\n/Actor/Dustin_Hoffman/Awards?url=/Ocsar/2009/BestMovie\n\nDoes that make any sense?\n\nDarrel\n\n\nOn Sun, May 17, 2009 at 6:36 PM, Michael Schuerig &lt;michael@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m pondering how a RESTful service can best support a highly\n&gt; interactive UI. I think HATEOAS precludes hard-coding application\n&gt; specific intelligence on the client. I&#39;m not sure if it is reconcilable\n&gt; with shipping rules or other metadata to the client. And I have no good\n&gt; idea how to map to resources some of the things I&#39;d need to find out\n&gt; from the server.\n&gt;\n&gt; A case in point from a movie database (my running example for pestering\n&gt; various mailing lists): There are movies and their associated\n&gt; participants, there are unaffiliated people, and there are awards.\n&gt; Everyone&#39;s supreme goal is to receive an award. So the user tries to\n&gt; help, grabs an award and starts to drag it around. But where to drop it?\n&gt; There are all kinds of potential targets around, but on closer scrutiny\n&gt; (requiring intelligence) only some of them fit. You just can&#39;t honor an\n&gt; actor with a Best Picture Oscar. And, after all, the award may already\n&gt; have been given to some other person/movie for the relevant year.\n&gt;\n&gt; In other words, which one of the, say, 100 potential drop targets are\n&gt; really eligible, is a highly dynamic decision best left to the server.\n&gt; So, given a list of candidate drop targets, how do I RESTfully ask the\n&gt; server to filter them and return only the real contenders?\n&gt;\n&gt; There are two additional constraints I can immediately think of. There\n&gt; are too many candidates to comfortably stuff into the query string of a\n&gt; GET request. Having to ask the server at all is too bad, performance-\n&gt; wise, but unavoidable (AFAICT). Several trips, e.g. for POSTing a new\n&gt; resource and then GETting the needed information from it in another\n&gt; request, is probably too much traffic.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m very curious to read your suggestions.\n&gt;\n&gt; Michael\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n\n"}}
