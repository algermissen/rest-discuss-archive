That would be one way\n&gt; &gt; for Google to allow people to register new unindexed resources, for\n&gt; &gt; example.  But as mentioned below, the name is confusing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, there&#39;s no problem POSTing an update to /search (or whatever),\n&gt; but doing a query through POST doesn&#39;t seem very RESTy at all.\n\nRight.  I guess I wasn&#39;t clear, my apologies.\n\n&gt; So, to review (and make sure I&#39;ve got a cohesive interface), \n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.example.org/addresses \n&gt;    Exposes the DB as a whole\n&gt;    GET: representation is the main interface (queries, etc.)\n&gt;    POST: add a new entry, returns a 303 to the created resource\n\nHmm, if you&#39;re creating a new resource it should be returned with a\n201.  You won&#39;t get an auto redirect, but the client will know the\nURI of the new resource.  The body can also include a link if a\nbrowser is your client.\n\n&gt; http://www.example.org/addresses?repr=add\n&gt;    GET: representation is an add form\n\n/addresses could serve that purposes, no need for the new URI.\nContent negotiation could be used to negotiate a representation\ncapable of expressing a form.\n\n&gt; http://www.example.org/addresses?query_to_the_db\n&gt;    GET: representation is a listing of the query\n\nLooks good.\n\n&gt; http://www.example.org/addresses/thePerson\n&gt;    exposes a particular record\n&gt;    GET: representation is a person&#39;s record\n&gt;    POST: update the resource/record, returns a 303 to the resource\n&gt;    PUT: create the resource/record (multiple content-types\n&gt;         supported?), returns a status page (or a 303?)\n&gt;    DELETE: delete the resource/record, returns a status page\n\nGood.\n\n&gt; http://www.example.org/addresses/thePerson?repr=edit\n&gt;    GET: representation is an edit form\n\nAgain, could content negotiation not be used to retrieve an editable\nformat?\n\nBTW, my other message I promised is turning into something that should\nprobably be sent to uri@..., so stay tuned.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
