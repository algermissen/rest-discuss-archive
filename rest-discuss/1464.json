It will probably look like the patient URI we&#39;ve already seen\n\nI&#39;m not sure about the /new as it looks suspiciously like a verb and REST resources should be nouns. I&#39;d be tempted to use /patients/schema or /patients/structure on which a GET will return the required fields list (alternatively the list returned from a GET to /patients could include a link to the patients required field structure, see also my ps below). You would then do a POST containing the appropriate data to /patients to create a new patient. \nSimilarly for /patients/uuid/orders/new and /orders/uuid/activities/new. \n\nI&#39;m a bit confused on the relationship between orders/activities and procedures, as you say :\n\n&gt;Each patient has a list of orders....Each order has a list of activities...\n&gt;There can be many different types of orders. Each different type requires different bits of information. We call an order type a procedure. \n\nand later you say:\n\n&gt;This list of orders will contain a link to the page that lists all of the procedures that can be used to create a new order for this type of patient.\n\nI don&#39;t understand this sentence at all. \n\n\nI was thinking you might have the following resource structure:\n\n/orders\n\non which a GET returns a list of all the available procedures( aka order types)\n\n/orders/procedure1\n/orders/procedure2\n/orders/procedure3\n...\n\nA GET on /orders/procedureN would return the structure of that particular order type, including the activities, i.e.\n\n&lt;order type=&#39;procedureN&#39;&gt;\n    &lt;activities&gt;\n        &lt;activity type=&#39;activity1&#39; mandatory=true&gt;\n             ...add required activity info specification\n        &lt;/activity&gt;\n        ....\n    &lt;/activities&gt;\n&lt;/order&gt;\n\nNote that you could allow a POST to /orders/procedureN as long as the posted info contained a valid UUID of the patient to add the order to. This would allow you a bit of symmetry in the /orders and /patients URI&#39;s. \n\nIf activities are always subordinate to orders do you need the separate /activities URI&#39;s? Could you use /patients/uuid/orders/uuid or alternatively /patients/uuid/orders/procedureN/activityN to POST the data containing the required activity information?\n\nRobert\n\nPS One thing that has been bothering me in the REST examples I have seen - how are the required formats/structures discovered by the user? For example, in the case of REST-ifying the UserLand XML storage api (http://internet.conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/RestifyingUserlandsXmlStorageSystem) it says:\n&quot;xmlStorageSystem.registerUser() \nThis method creates a new user account, or updates an existing one on the server. This could quite easily have been done with either an XML document containing this information...&quot; \n\nHow do I as a user or a system find out what structure the XML document should be?\n\n\n"}}
