This way I =\r\ncan search for companies with a URL like\n&gt; this &quot;/companies?name=3D&lt;pattern=\r\n&gt;&quot; or for products with URLs:\n&gt; &quot;/products?name=3D&lt;pattern&gt;&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Then I th=\r\nought, products actually belong to the companies producing\n&gt; them. So I cam=\r\ne up with this product-URL:\n&gt; &quot;/companies/&lt;comp-id&gt;/products/&lt;prod-id&gt;&quot;.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; But here&#39;s my problem now: how should a search be designed which is to\n&gt; =\r\nsearch among all products of all companies - a global product search\n&gt; that=\r\n is? &quot;/companies/&lt;comp-id&gt;/products?name=3D&lt;pattern&gt;&quot; doesn&#39;t work\n&gt; global=\r\nly - at least it shouldnt.\n&gt;\n&gt; Am I to expose something like &quot;/search?type=\r\n=3Dproducts&name=3D&lt;pattern&gt;&quot;\n&gt; or are there reasonable alternatives?\n&gt;\n&gt; O=\r\nr am I better off with the first approach?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; How would you design such =\r\nan API?\n&gt;\n\n\n\nYou don&#39;t say this explicitly, but it sounds like &quot;designing a=\r\nn API&quot;\nmeans, you are designing a formula that programmers of client progra=\r\nms\ncan use to construct a query url.\n\nIf that is what you mean, well, I wis=\r\nh we&#39;d do less of that.\n\nThe form of a query url should only be important t=\r\no the server\nimplementor. The server should deliver an HTML form or Xform o=\r\nr some\nsuch, that tells the client to fill in some blanks, and then using t=\r\nhe\nrules of HTML forms, the client composes the URL.\n\nWhen you do that, it =\r\nwon&#39;t matter if you decide for queries the one\nway, then three weeks later =\r\ndecide to do it the other way, or some\nthird way.\n\nIf this is machine to ma=\r\nchine communication, it amounts to telling\ndevelopers to look for &lt;input&gt; e=\r\nlements named &quot;product-id&quot; and to form\nthe url according the rules of the f=\r\norms language, e.g. append\n&quot;?name=3Dvalue...&quot; to the form&#39;s action attribut=\r\ne.\n\nI admit I&#39;m not sounding very convincing with this argument, because\nI&#39;=\r\nm asking you a) to have clients make an extra GET first to retrieve\nthe for=\r\nm, and b) they still have to have some foreknowledge of the\nelement name at=\r\ntributes they should understand. It does however\ninsulate them from having =\r\nto understand the form of your urls.\n\nI guess I&#39;m putting this out here for=\r\n discussion, and not really\nsuggesting you implement it this way. But if an=\r\nyone out there thinks\nthere&#39;s a good way to do what I&#39;m trying to do, which=\r\n is to drive the\ninteraction through forms, please jump in.\n\n\n\nHugh\n\n"}}
