All\n&gt; protocol-compliant clients need to be coded to recognize and respond\n&gt; appropriately to them per the RFC.\n&gt; \n&gt; Most protocol-level response codes allow for servers to also return\n&gt; entity bodies that contain *application-level* information. Clients\n&gt; that are coded to understand the application-level protocol will be\n&gt; responsible for understanding these particular entity bodies, just as\n&gt; they understand the &quot;non-error&quot; entity bodies.\n&gt; \n&gt; Coding application-level protocols detail is not covered in REST or\n&gt; the HTTP RFC.\n\nGood comment, Mike.\n\nJakob, note that the body you receive in the case of 4xx also contributes to application state. 4xx does not mean that the communication / the application failed. It just means that the intended interaction result was not achieved. The body tells you what to do next. If your automated user agent understands the media type of that body, it can probably take a sensible action.\n\nEven something simple as sending the body of e.g. a 406 response to the IT helpdesk with an incident report is still WAY BETTER than an RPC call that just dies upon you.\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; mca\n&gt; http://amundsen.com/blog/\n&gt; http://twitter.com@mamund\n&gt; http://mamund.com/foaf.rdf#me\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; #RESTFest 2010\n&gt; http://rest-fest.googlecode.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Wed, Feb 9, 2011 at 13:55, Jan Algermissen &lt;algermissen1971@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; On Feb 9, 2011, at 7:45 PM, Jakob Strauch wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; What about the possible errors? Well, maybe i have to expect all HTTP response codes.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Yep! HTTP *is* the interface. You have to expect all of it.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; At least the common one (404 etc.). In practice, only a smal subset of response codes will be supported.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Why? And besides - who knows what intermediaries sit in the middle and produce responses the service developer never dreamed of?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; But how do you tell the clients, which ones?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; RFC2616 tells them. There is no service specific description in a RESTful system.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Are response codes not part of the &quot;contract&quot;.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; The contract is HTTP. No more no less. That is what clients have to understand.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Jan\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; P.S. However, in order to develop clients, you must have some sort of knowledge about the media types and link relations to expect. That is what the global registry (IANA) is for. If you apply REST inside the enterprise, an enterprise-global registry will suffice, meaning you do not necessarily have to register all your media types with IANA....but you can, of course.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Or are even all response part implicit part of the contract?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Jakob\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
