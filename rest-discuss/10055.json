So you point the login form to\n&gt;\n&gt;    POST /session\n&gt;\n&gt; That sounds not too bad, but I have mixed feelings because I send a\n&gt; login and a password to create a resource whose representation has\n&gt; nothing to do with logins and passwords. (Please forget for a moment\n&gt; whether a session is RESTful or not itself).\n&gt;\n&gt; My metaphor for thinking in resources is files: either I send the\n&gt; entire representation of a resource or I am not playing by the rules.\n&gt; For example I am not allowed to send a partial representation of a\n&gt; resource meaning &quot;update just these attributes&quot;, because REST just\n&gt; allows PUTing the whole resource (please correct me if that&#39;s more\n&gt; flexible).\n&gt;\n&gt; So, if I send login and password I send input to construct a resource,\n&gt; but I am not sending the very resource. So it smells as suspicious.\n&gt;\n&gt; What do you think?\n&gt;\n&gt; -- fxn\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
