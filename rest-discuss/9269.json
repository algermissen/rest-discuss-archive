PATCH, or any other \n&gt;&gt; solution, also needs to be deployed, and servers need to be able to \n&gt;&gt; advertise the capability -- e.g., via Allow: -- for them to be really \n&gt;&gt; useful.  All of this is an optimization anyway; you don&#39;t want clients \n&gt;&gt; attempting PATCH on every server and giving up if it bounces off.  So \n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not sure why it&#39;s any harder to deploy than any other solution.  Any \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; John,\n&gt; \n&gt; the deployment issue is that there are servers out there that *ignore* \n&gt; Range headers in requests. When they do, a client that tried just to \n&gt; send a range will have replaced the whole resource -&gt; data loss.\n\nThanks for the links.  I understand the problem you&#39;re referring to but \nit doesn&#39;t apply to my question..  The links you reference were in the \ncontext of an HTTP working group dealing with generic HTTP servers, a \nlack of implementation experience, lack of people reviewing the draft... \nI think the situation here is quite different.\n\nMy questions are rather what extensions we should recommend for servers \nwho wish to support them.  And how PATCH compares to using \nContent-Range:.  I don&#39;t see a huge difference between PATCH and \nContent-Range: in this respect, because servers are going to need to \nadvertise either one before a client will attempt them.\n\nThere was also an assumption in the W3 WG that they were talking about \nbyte range updates, and I think that what we really are looking at is \ninfoset level deltas.  Which I think changes the discussion.\n\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; WebDAV mailing list archives available for perusal?\n&gt;  &gt; ...\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/2002JanMar/0144.html&gt;\n&gt; &lt;http://www.google.de/search?q=site%3Alists.w3.org%2FArchives%2FPublic%2Fw3c-dist-auth+put+range&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards, Julian\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
