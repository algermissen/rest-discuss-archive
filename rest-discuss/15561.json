We&#39;ve had that discussi=\r\non, though we haven&#39;t come to\nagreement (the spreadsheet faction will be ha=\r\nppy to have your vote).\nThe sticking point centers around the fact that use=\r\nrs define columns\nwhen they create the table and then give each column a da=\r\ntatype.  Each\nrow describes a logical entity - cells really dont mean much =\r\non their\nown.  Aside from users editing invidual cells in the table, most o=\r\nf\nthe rest of the system will be querying these tables and dealing with\nthe=\r\nm in a row-oriented fashion  (give me list of all of the radar\nsites with g=\r\nreen status, with the results containing the site name,\nlatitude and longit=\r\nude)\n\nA spreadsheet model is still on the table (no pun intended), but we\nm=\r\nay end up having a hybrid model where the UI sees a spreadsheet\nmodel, but =\r\nother services in the system see a table model.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Over time, they will =\r\nneed\n&gt;&gt; to update the values in various cells in these tables. =A0When they=\r\n do\n&gt;&gt; their updates, they are going to want to make all of their changes a=\r\nnd\n&gt;&gt; then click save; they will not stand for having to press save after\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; editing each cell or row in the table - hence the batch update.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Not =\r\nhaving to hit save&quot; =3D AJAX\n\nIt&#39;s not about having to hit save or not, it&#39;=\r\ns about hitting save\nonce, and having all of the changes applied in a singl=\r\ne transaction.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;AJAX + spreadsheet&quot; =3D\n&gt; http://www.socialtext.com/pr=\r\noducts/spreadsheets.php\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I dont think there&#39;s much question the batch u=\r\npdate is needed. =A0If a\n&gt;&gt; user wants to update a status column in every r=\r\now in a 50 row table,\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not sure sending 50 PUT requests when they cli=\r\nck the save button\n&gt;&gt; is appropriate.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you distribute the 50 PUT requ=\r\nests out as they type, it&#39;s very\n&gt; appropriate. Seems to be working for Soc=\r\nialCalc (the successor to\n&gt; wikiCalc, created by Dan Bricklin, the inventor=\r\n of VisiCalc).\n\nSee above - changes shouldnt be saved until users are ready=\r\n to save\nthem all.  (I&#39;ll have to check if that&#39;s really a requirement or j=\r\nust\nan assumption that we&#39;ve made.)\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But that&#39;s really a separate issu=\r\ne, and it&#39;s not the one I&#39;m worried\n&gt;&gt; about. =A0The harder part is the res=\r\nult of dealing with user-defined\n&gt;&gt; tables with arbitrary numbers of column=\r\ns. =A0I dont want to get down in\n&gt;&gt; the weeds, but basically, rows from the=\r\n user-defined tables do not map\n&gt;&gt; directly to records in the database. =A0=\r\nInstead, each field in a row is\n&gt;&gt; stored as a separate record in the datab=\r\nase. =A0A table with 10 columns\n&gt;&gt; and 50 rows is 500 records in the databa=\r\nse. =A0If a user is only\n&gt;&gt; updating values in a single column I&#39;d rather o=\r\nnly do 50 updates, and\n&gt;&gt; not 500.\n&gt;\n&gt; Give each cell its own URL and you&#39;l=\r\nl have 50 updates, not 500.\n\nYes - but I was hoping to have one network int=\r\neraction, not 50.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; At this point, the primary resource is the user-def=\r\nined table. =A0It is\n&gt;&gt; possible that other services may want to access ind=\r\nividual rows, but\n&gt;&gt; more likely, they&#39;ll want to be able to retrieve one o=\r\nr two columns\n&gt;&gt; for all of the rows in the table. =A0And even if they do w=\r\nant a single\n&gt;&gt; row, it&#39;ll likely be addressed as a query of the table reso=\r\nurce, and\n&gt;&gt; not directly. =A0So most get requests will be for the table (o=\r\nr some\n&gt;&gt; portion of it) and not individual rows.\n&gt;\n&gt; If clients are retrie=\r\nving arbitrary subsets of the table based on both\n&gt; rows and columns, it se=\r\nems odd, then, to standardize on row-based\n&gt; representations.\n&gt;\n\nMaybe.  On=\r\n the other hand, when you query a database table for a\nsubset of the rows a=\r\nnd columns, what you get back is a row-based representation.\n\n&gt;&gt; My main co=\r\nncern at this point is to come up with a document type that\n&gt;&gt; can be used =\r\nfor all interactions with these user-defined tables. =A0I\n&gt;&gt; would prefer t=\r\nhat clients not have to use a separate document type to\n&gt;&gt; do updates.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nI think that document type is the cell. It fits the requirements, is\n&gt; REST=\r\nful, and has prior art now in the field. Or you could go buy\n&gt; SocialText o=\r\nff the shelf. Or hand Google Docs to your client. Or any of\n&gt; http://en.wik=\r\nipedia.org/wiki/List_of_online_spreadsheets\n&gt;\n\nThanks for the pointers - th=\r\ney should provide useful fodder...\n\nUnfortunately, those are options we wis=\r\nh we had.  Our customers are\nmilitary, so internet-based solutions are non-=\r\nstarters.  If we were\ngoing to go off-the-shelf, it would be to use sharepo=\r\nint lists (not\nbecause we like that, but because that&#39;s where an awful lot =\r\nof our\ncustomer&#39;s data already is.)  Also, off-the-shelf solutions require =\r\na\ntedious security approval process, so any off-the-shelf solution would\nha=\r\nve to have compelling advantage over sharepoint.\n\nWe&#39;ve had much debate abo=\r\nut even providing this feature in the first\nplace because we really dont wa=\r\nnt to be re-inventing the wheel - but a\nfew (important) customers dont have=\r\n access to sharepoint and so need\nan alternative with equivalent functional=\r\nity.\n\n\n--Chuck\n\n"}}
