That&#39;s one of the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; primary REST constraints in HTTP.\n&gt;&gt; Not quite; that treads close to implementation dependence. GET safety is \n&gt;&gt; about accountability. You can&#39;t stop server owners doing stupid things \n&gt;&gt; in their implementations, but you can assume it won&#39;t be your fault when \n&gt;&gt; they do.\n&gt; \n&gt; In my own awkward way, that&#39;s part of what I was trying to say. The kind of\n&gt; side-effects I was thinking of as OK would be things like logging requests:\n&gt; it&#39;s a side effect, but it&#39;s not externally visible and if the server\n&gt; stopped doing it, the client would know none the better.\n\nAgreed. I think another possibility is where something happens in \nreaction to the GET, but the client isn&#39;t necessarily aware that this is \nhow it is happening - e.g the ID generation you discussed earlier could \nbe performed by incrementing a counter on GET but could also be \nperformed by some sort of UUID algorithm. As long as the semantics of \nthe resource are are &quot;ID generator that guarantees uniqueness - \nrepresentation gives current state&quot; rather than &quot;Next in series&quot; then \nthe fact that an increment is happening on GET is just an implementation \nartefact that doesn&#39;t concern the client.\n\n\n"}}
