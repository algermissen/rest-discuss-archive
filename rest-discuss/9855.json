Tools like SpyBot\n&gt; S&D now warn and delete such cookies. Cookies have serious privacy\n&gt; concerns. There are caching issues as well as cookies are not  \n&gt; described\n&gt; in the spec.\n&gt;\n&gt; Just enable the &quot;ask&quot; option for cookies and then surf the web.  \n&gt; Everyone\n&gt; wants to store data on your pc these days.\n&gt;\n\nBut my point is that your suggestion seems to reinvent the same thing.  \nAfter all, your use case seems to be tracking user behavior.
