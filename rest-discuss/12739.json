But forget about the last paragraph  if \nyou don&#39;t like images, my point is still the same.\n\nMy point, HATEAOS is not about the Hipermedia, it&#39;s about the Engine \nthat uses the Hipermedia. A &quot;goodbye&quot; page with no links in it doesn&#39;t \nbreak HATEOAS, it simply means that there are no states to go.\n\n\nPeter Keane wrote:\n&gt; 2009/6/3 António Mota &lt;amsmota@...&gt;:\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; For me, actually the more important word in the expanded HATEOAS is not\n&gt;&gt; Hipermedia, but Engine. Implying that is not sufficient for a\n&gt;&gt; representation &quot;to have links&quot;, it&#39;s important to understand that those\n&gt;&gt; links are the way used by the server to drive the application from one\n&gt;&gt; state to another. The links per se are useless, unless they are a\n&gt;&gt; expression of the intentions of the server.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If you receive a representation of a resource from the server with no\n&gt;&gt; links, it&#39;s nevertheless complying with HATEOAS, meaning that there is\n&gt;&gt; no more states to go from there (imagine a &quot;goodbye&quot; page).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Now if you use Javascript to insert a bunch of links in it, that\n&gt;&gt; doesn&#39;t make it more HATEOAS... Actually, if you do that you are\n&gt;&gt; breaking HATEOAS, because you can insert a link that you know that\n&gt;&gt; corresponds to some state of the application (now it has hypermedia),\n&gt;&gt; but since it was not originated by the server, it&#39;s not a engine to\n&gt;&gt; anything... You don&#39;t break the H but you break the E... :)\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; Per the code-on-demand bits of REST, presumably the server DID\n&gt; originate that javascript, so I don&#39;t think that breaks HATEOS.\n&gt;\n&gt; --peter\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; So I think I&#39;ll stick with HATEOAS.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Josh Sled wrote:\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Nick Gall &lt;nick.gall@...&gt; writes:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; HATEOAS: HYDEPR\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;HATEOAS&quot; is atrocious, and &quot;HYDEPR&quot; is not much better.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve never found &quot;the hypermedia constraint&quot; or &quot;hypermedia&quot; to be\n&gt;&gt;&gt; insufficient.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;     \n\n\n"}}
