I.e. put the\n&gt;transaction into a query\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nExcept that query strings have problems with caching proxies.  Now, this \nmay not be much of an issue since caching might not be as important here.\n\n&gt;2) when the transaction is initiated tie it to the identity of the\n&gt;client (maybe IP or something more unique), then when a raw PUT is\n&gt;performed it can be checked to see that it is in an existing\n&gt;transaction\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThis also means that the you cannot pass the transaction URI or resource \nURIs (within the context of the transaction) to anyone.  It is even \npossible to lose access to your transaction altogether, since it is \nalways possible that a DHCP server could re-assign your IP address in \nthe middle of a transaction.\n\nSeairth\n\n\n\n"}}
