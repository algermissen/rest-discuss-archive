Servers have the necessary \nmechanisms with HTTP by which to indicate that a resource has changed \nlocation - so the choice to accommodate this kind of &#39;URI dependent&#39; \nclient behavior for a given resource is down to the implementation\n\n- Mike\n\nNick Gall wrote\n&gt;\n&gt; Either both are or neither are.\n&gt;\n&gt; If (i) means &quot;organizing its URI space in a stable manner&quot;, ie so that \n&gt; bookmarking URIs works over long periods of time, then the practice of \n&gt; bookmarking is a violation of REST -- assuming that REST means \n&gt; minimizing dependency on stable URIs and instead navigating to \n&gt; potentially transient URIs via stable media types and HATEOAS.\n&gt;\n&gt; I raised this point \n&gt; &lt;http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/12093&gt; back \n&gt; in February. Every time a client (whether a user client - aka browser \n&gt; - or not) bookmarks a link (aka stores it on the client side), it \n&gt; creates a dependency on the current URI space -- however it is \n&gt; organized. It doesn&#39;t matter if the URIs are opaque GUIDs or \n&gt; human-intuitive path-based. REST seems to suggest that creating (or \n&gt; encouraging) such dependencies is uncool.\n&gt;\n&gt; But Tim Berners-Lee et al seem to believe that being able to depend on \n&gt; stable URIs IS cool &lt;http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI&gt;:\n&gt;\n&gt;     /It is the the duty of a [URI space designer] to allocate URIs\n&gt;     which you will be able to stand by in 2 years, in 20 years, in 200\n&gt;     years. This needs thought, and organization, and commitment./\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TBL gives advice on how to achieve such URI stability \n&gt; &lt;http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI&gt;.)\n&gt;\n&gt; If a cool (well-designed) URI space should be stable for 200 years, \n&gt; then it should be OK for clients to either bookmark them as received \n&gt; or to generate them from templates.\n&gt;\n&gt; So if REST discourages either URI bookmarking OR generating URIs from \n&gt; templates, then it is in tension with one of the fundamental \n&gt; principles of the Web: Cool URIs don&#39;t change. I think this is \n&gt; somewhat ironic.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure I agree with Roy that this tension is like sexual tension \n&gt; &lt;http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/12101&gt;, but \n&gt; it IS an interesting comparison(!):\n&gt;\n&gt;     /If there is a tension between the desire to bookmark and the fact\n&gt;     that REST encourages folks to break up an application into a state\n&gt;     machine of reusable resource states, then I would consider it to\n&gt;     be more like sexual tension. Just because you have it doesn&#39;t mean\n&gt;     it is bad, and one way to improve things is to make the more\n&gt;     important resource links look sexier than the less important ones./\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -- Nick\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
