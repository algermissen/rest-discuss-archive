That&#39;s\nthe point of Wiki!=\r\n  Out of courtesy, it&#39;s probably not a good idea to enact\ngross changes wit=\r\nhout some discussion, but otherwise...\n\nI&#39;m amenable to a change to reflect=\r\n primary emphasis on addressability.  I\nwould simply ask that the rather st=\r\nellar (ahem! ;-) quote that&#39;s cited from\nTHE c2 wiki just be shoved further=\r\n down page. (Grinz --- love being quoted,\ndon=B9t want to lose those somewh=\r\nat-insightful words. :-)\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, I have long been concerned that the fo=\r\ncus on a &quot;small set of\n&gt; verbs&quot; misses the point that it is not the small s=\r\net that is central but\n&gt; rather their generality and commonality. Four, six=\r\n, ten, fifty. It\n&gt; doesn&#39;t matter much as long as they are general.\n\nActual=\r\nly, I *do* believe this number is critically important.  That number\nis an =\r\nexponential factor, not a multiplicative constant, in determining the\ncompo=\r\nsitional complexity of any software system.  At some point --- maybe,\nmodul=\r\no more commercial concerns --- I may trot out the mathematical argument\nher=\r\ne.  But I think this is the under-recognized and supremely important\naspect=\r\n of the meta-theory behind REST:  the &quot;width&quot; and variety of\ninterfaces has=\r\n a direct and geometric impact on the overall complexity of\nsystems that us=\r\ne those interfaces...\n\n&gt; Let&#39;s be more explicit, we are pushing complexity =\r\naround and hopefully\n&gt; reducing it but not competely changing its order not=\r\nation.\n\nThis argument is no more and no less compelling and authoritative t=\r\nhan its\ncontrary --- it relies on an intuitive, unsupported, and potentiall=\r\ny\n&quot;superstitious&quot; notion that there is some canonically meaningful notion o=\r\nf\ncomplexity that is static across all formulations.  An even simpler notio=\r\nn\nof complexity --- lines of code --- may in fact be canonically meaningful=\r\n\nbut is *certainly* not static across all formulations; and the argument fo=\r\nr\nreduction of compositional complexity via interface minimization relies o=\r\nn\njust that notion.\n\nJb\n\n\n\n------ End of Forwarded Message\n\n\n"}}
