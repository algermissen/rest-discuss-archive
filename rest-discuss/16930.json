(Which is actually a truly amazing show case of REST if you think about it - millions of concurrent active customers do not prevent the server from changing[1]).\n\nAny references on the Apple Question?\n\nJan\n\n[1] It has always wondered me why this alone does not cause all the Big-Co IT guys to jump on REST immediately but that is another issue :-)\n\n"}}
