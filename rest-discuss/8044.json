But I am not sure about a better\n&gt; REST way for it. What I can think is to include the URL of service B\n&gt; in the XML posted to service A.\n\n\nWS-A is surprisingly less helpful than you think. You need to be sure\nthat all participants in the conversation are using the same version\nof WS-A, that they have consistent implementations (which is hard to\ndo in the absence of any meaningful tests), especially of the async\nstuff like the faulting bits. Then you need to have a client whose\nhostname remains constant over time, and with ports accessible to the\ncaller.\n\nBelieve me, its hard to get working and doesnt like laptops or\nfirewalls very well.\n\nMaybe there&#39;s a better way to model the interaction, instead of\nrequests-routed-to-a-service, but as conversation about resources,\nwhere the conversation itself becomes something you can refer to, the\nclient polling it for state changes, its URL being passed around to\ninterested parties.\n\n-steve\n\n"}}
