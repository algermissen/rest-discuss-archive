Authentication is easy, and nicely taken care of by the \n&gt; servlet container.  It&#39;s the Authentication that becomes more difficult. \n&gt;   What we&#39;re looking for is a framework that allows us to plug in rules \n&gt; for authorization and ask the question &quot;Can User U PUT Data D?&quot; easily. \n&gt;   I haven&#39;t seen much in controling PUT and DELETE.  I would love to do \n&gt; it in the Apache level, much like I can control GET there.\n&gt; \n&gt; Seth\n\n\n\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
