It has some very\n&gt; &gt; interesting characteristics that make it a good fit for various\n&gt; &gt; integration scenarios, amongst other things.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Philosophically, it can almost be perceived as a simpler, easier,\n&gt; &gt; REST-\n&gt; &gt; oriented alternative to SOAP. We may finally have something to  \n&gt; counter\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; dirtiness that is SOAP, since Atom can be a very good enveloping\n&gt; &gt; mechanism.\n&gt;\n&gt; HTTP is REST&#39;s current alternative to SOAP\n&gt; +enough-WSDL-to-make-SOAP-do-something-useful. Atom is more like  \n&gt; REST&#39;s\n&gt; (someone&#39;s?) alternative to RDF. That is to say, it compliments a\n&gt; growing family of standard document types that can be included in each\n&gt; other, and can be extended for domain-specific uses without  \n&gt; inventing a\n&gt; whole new vocabulary.\n\nNonsense.\n\nAPP is just a way to publish content. It is a simpler version of WebDAV.\nSee  http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/what_atom_is_all_about\n\nYou can publish RDF using APP, just as you can publish RDF using WebDAV.\n\nYou don&#39;t even have to wrap what you publish using atom. See section 5.3\nhttp://bitworking.org/projects/atom/draft-ietf-atompub- \nprotocol-13.html#rfc.section.5.3\n\nAnd neither does the server have to wrap what he receives in atom.\n\nFurthermore one can give a very good RDF ontology of Atom.\n\nAtom Owl Ontology:\nhttp://bblfish.net/work/atom-owl/2006-06-06/AtomOwl.html\n\nwhich one can then use to query information source, such as the  \nRoller blog engine\n\nSPARQLing Roller:\nhttp://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/sparqling_roller\n\n\n&gt; RDF builds an abstract metamodel and expects vocabularies to fill the\n&gt; rest of the gaps. Successful formats to date have taken a different\n&gt; approach of defining vocabulary and document structure together. XML\n&gt; appears to be a good tool in defining these document types. It allows\n&gt; other XML documents to be easily included as sub-documents. It allows\n&gt; existing document types to be extended. Combined with mime, it even  \n&gt; has\n&gt; a means to be explicit about the extension. I might define an\n&gt; industry-specific application/pids+atom+xml document type that  \n&gt; could be\n&gt; interpreted purely as atom, but also has special features and  \n&gt; vocabulary\n&gt; that can be handled by parsers aware of the relevant extensions.\nYes, and that is the big problem with trying to use syntax to  \nexchange data. You end up having to do double the amount of work  \nother people have to do. Not only do you have to model the types of  \nobjects that exist and the way they relate to each other, you also  \nhave to find an arbitrary tree structure to fit them it.\n\nAll XML Roads Lead to RDF:\nhttp://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/how_applying_xml_to_data\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I see the aggregation and sub-classing features of XML as the core of\n&gt; the semantic web going forwards. I think this is a more fully-featured\n&gt; way of representing data than rigid RDF.\n\nNo, it is xml that is rigid.\nSee Crystalising RDF\nhttp://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/crystalizing_rdf\n\n&gt; Perhaps my main concern going\n&gt; forwards is the modern propensity to try and replace MIME with  \n&gt; URIs. If\n&gt; I have an xml uri of http://w3c.org/xml and want to subclass it my url\n&gt; would likely look something like &lt;http://wrsa.com.au/something&gt;. In  \n&gt; this\n&gt; case it is difficult for parsers to know that they can treat my  \n&gt; document\n&gt; type as xml for the purpose of running xpath queries. I think mime and\n&gt; URIs both have their problems, but I think the problems with URIs are\n&gt; more terminal when it comes to building a real semantic web.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Benjamin.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
