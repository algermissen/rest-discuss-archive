(Many\nof them seem willing to help, probably in large part because Tahoe is\na Free and Open project.)\n\nThe first and so far best attack on Tahoe was a CSRF attack due to\nNathan Wilcox.  A full write-up of the history of that attack and our\ngeneral strategy for making RESTful services secure against CSRF\nattacks is here:\n\nhttp://hacktahoe.org/nathan_wilcox.html\n\nI would be very interested in your comments, either on this list or on\nthe tahoe-dev list [3], or cross-posted, as appropriate.\n\nRegards,\n\nZooko O&#39;Whielacronx\n\n[1] http://allmydata.org\n[2] http://hacktahoe.org\n[3] http://allmydata.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tahoe-dev\n\n\n"}}
