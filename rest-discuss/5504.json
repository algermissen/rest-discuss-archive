Instead of hardcoding the resource URI that the data should  \nbe POSTed to into the component&#39;s code, I want the component to  \ndiscover it at runtime (well - obviously, because otherwise I would  \nnot post to *this* list :-)\n\nIn order to enable this, (I think) I need to introduce one additional  \nhardcoded semantic, which is the type of resource to send the  \nconfiguration data to (the &#39;processor type&#39;). Suppose the component  \nsomehow receives information about available processors as RDFForms  \nduring prior interactions with the rest of the system and stores them  \nfor later use.\n\nWhen the time has come to POST the configuration data my component  \nwould simply lookup any processor of type e.g. foo:ConfigProcessor  \nand send the data there.\n\nWhen I started to implement the RDFForms awarness into my client  \ncomponent library today and checked back with your description I  \nrealized that I maybe entirely missed the point.\n\nWhile it seems correct to lookup the processor by type I am troubled  \nby the requirement for the client to indicate the intent (submitting  \nto a foo:ConfigProcessor *and not* simply to an rf:Container) in the  \nPOST message and that this can only be done by using a message  \nenvelope that supports declaring the intent (if I got that correctly).\n\nThree questions:\n\n1. Is my understanding (now) correct?\n\n2. What is the architectural principle that made you include this  \nconstraint?\n\n3. What is the architectural damage that would be caused by ignoring the\n    requirement to declare the intent?\n\nThanks.\n\n\nJan\n\n\n[1] http://www.markbaker.ca/2003/05/RDF-Forms/\n\n\n"}}
