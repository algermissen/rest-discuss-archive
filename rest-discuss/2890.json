This is an\n&gt; apples-to-oranges comparison (possible more like fruit-to-apples). \n&gt; There is no REST toolkit because REST is not an implementable \n&gt; specification, just an architectural style.  It seems to me that \n&gt; Dave&#39;s comments do nothing more than show he doesn&#39;t understand what \n&gt; REST is.  I would have given a bit more credit to his opinion if he \n&gt; had instead asked/answered why SOAP isn&#39;t RESTful.\n\nOn the one hand, it is true that Dave doesn&#39;t understand what REST is. \nOn the other hand, he has been told what it is several times, and it \nwould only take a willingness to read his own inbox to understand why \nthe things he said are BS. In fact, I&#39;m sure as he was writing them, he \nknew what the counter-arguments were. But he sees everything in \npolitical terms and REST was not properly designed to be a political \ntechnology. It has an unweildy acronym and it is more about telling \npeople to use stuff in the right way rather than selling them something \nnew and improved.\n\n&gt; REST doesn&#39;t make the things you use.  REST makes the things you use \n&gt; better.\n\nI like it.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
