I am particulary interested in  \nclever ideas how to document interactions that run through an  \nintermediary.\n\nI have started out giving both, request issueing components and  \nresources life lines in a sequence diagram and documenting HTTP  \nrequests as ordinary method calls. This feels quite natural and  \nprovides good overviews of related HTTP interactions.\n\nMy problem is that I would like to document calls that run through  \nintermediaries in a clean way but since in that cases the receiver of  \nthe method call is not the &#39;logical&#39; receiver things become a bit  \ndifficult.\n\nAny ideas? Has anyone done something like this before?\n\nThanks.\n\nJan\n\n\n\n"}}
