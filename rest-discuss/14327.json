Take a problem the is not client server spec=\r\nific. Ie: try something that spans domains, that requires distributed coope=\r\nration among agents. eg: Social Networks. Think big, and built simple.\n\n2. =\r\ndefine your models using RDF. Take an example on foaf:\n   \n   http://xmlns.=\r\ncom/foaf/0.1/\n\n   (and publish those models as linked data, so we have recu=\r\nrsion)\n\n3. Create Linked Data using those models. \n   Build linked data exa=\r\nmples that span across domains. Ie. one resource is defined on my site, the=\r\n other on yours and link between them. FOAF is a good example of this.\n\n  s=\r\nee for example how the data in this file points to data others have on thei=\r\nr web site\n\n  curl  http://bblfish.net/people/henry/card\n\n   You can choose=\r\n one or more media types to do this, with content negotiation. Ie: the same=\r\n URL can return any number of representations: html, rdf/xml, n3, ...\n\n4. C=\r\nreate browsers of linked data\n \n  eg, the foaf address book \n  https://somm=\r\ner.dev.java.net/AddressBook.html\n  or web versions of the same\n  http://foa=\r\nf-visualizer.org/\n\n5. Add security restfully\n\n  eg, foaf+ssl\n  http://esw.w=\r\n3.org/topic/foaf+ssl\n\n6. Now you can do shopping, in a RESTful manner using=\r\n the GoodRelations ontology for example\n   http://purl.org/goodrelations/\n =\r\n  You probably just need to define certain types of resources, as being Sho=\r\nppingCarts, and actions that one needs to do on those to make it possible f=\r\nor people to create buying agents.\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
