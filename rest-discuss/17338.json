In theory i need only a single starting URL to &quot;explore&quot; a RE=\r\nSTful system. HEAD, OPTIONS can be used to retrieve supported HTTP operatio=\r\nns, the mediatype, supported security mechanismens. This can subsumed as an=\r\n interface contract.\n\nWhat about the possible errors? Well, maybe i have to=\r\n expect all HTTP response codes. At least the common one (404 etc.). In pra=\r\nctice, only a smal subset of response codes will be supported. But how do y=\r\nou tell the clients, which ones? Are response codes not part of the &quot;contra=\r\nct&quot;. Or are even all response part implicit part of the contract?\n\n\nJakob\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
