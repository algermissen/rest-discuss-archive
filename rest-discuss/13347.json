There is plenty of\n&gt; middleware active in the Web as we=\r\nll, like content distribution\n&gt; networks,\n&gt; name resolvers, load balancers,=\r\n etc. Middleware are implementation\n&gt; packages that may or may not fit a gi=\r\nven architecture, and should be\n&gt; used only when and where the fit is right=\r\n. Likewise, there are\n&gt; plenty of good RESTful architectures that end at th=\r\ne resource\n&gt; interface, behind which is another architecture composed of\n&gt; =\r\nmiddleware services that are not (and should not be) RESTful.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; People =\r\nwhinge a lot that Red Hat has too much of a bias.

The argument of bias\n&gt; &gt; is mostly moo=\r\nt (but not completely, of course). I personally get the\n&gt; &gt; feeling that th=\r\nese REST-* moves were genuinly of good nature, the only\n&gt; &gt; business bias t=\r\nhat I can see is that they jumped on an idea and went\n&gt; &gt; with it. That&#39;s m=\r\nore happening in the REST world in a long time, and\n&gt; &gt; as such I *really* =\r\nwelcome it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Would you welcome it if you went to a car dealer, asked=\r\n to see a\n&gt; new Camaro, and he insisted on showing you a Winnebago instead?=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Would you welcome it if you went to MacDonald&#39;s and ordered a\n&gt; filet-=\r\no-fish sandwich, and they gave you a Big Mac instead?\n&gt;\n&gt; WTF is wrong with=\r\n you people?\n&gt;\n&gt; Red Hat (or, more accurately, JBoss) unilaterally decided =\r\nto set\n&gt; themselves up as the equivalent of Sun within a JCP-like standards=\r\n\n&gt; organization on a topic for which they not only had NOTHING to\n&gt; do with=\r\n creating and know NOTHING about, but for which they\n&gt; actually sell produc=\r\nts that are the exact opposite of RESTful\n&gt; architecture. The organization =\r\nclaims that it will specify REST\n&gt; standards, that such standards will be l=\r\ned by benevolent dictators\n&gt; in the form of Spec Leads, that no overlapping=\r\n proposals would be\n&gt; allowed (IOW, the first Spec Lead owns the entire top=\r\nic as BDFL),\n&gt; and that Red Hat would be the only permanent member of the b=\r\noard\n&gt; to ensure that never changed.\n&gt;\n&gt; And, guess what -- the organizatio=\r\nn starts with a couple Spec Leads\n&gt; owning the topics that JBoss wants to S=\r\nELL YOU as REST, because\n&gt; they know damn well that their current market is=\r\n shrinking: their\n&gt; entire product architecture is based on J2EE, the giant=\r\n black\n&gt; hole of Java that is sucking itself into oblivion.\n&gt;\n&gt; But, no, th=\r\nis won&#39;t be the oh-too-formal version of REST that\n&gt; is found in my dissert=\r\nation. This will be the new, &quot;Pragmatic&quot;,\n&gt; AssHat version of REST, so that=\r\n JBoss can tell their customers\n&gt; that they are the new leaders in &quot;REST&quot; a=\r\nrchitecture and all\n&gt; they need to do get their systems to be RESTful 2.0-c=\r\nompliant\n&gt; is to buy their J2EE application server, now with REST-beans.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; Bill Burke is not evangelizing REST throughout the Java world.\n&gt; =\r\nWhat he is evangelizing is the same old architectures that he\n&gt; evangelized=\r\n as J2EE and WS-* -- the only difference is that now\n&gt; he starts off callin=\r\ng them REST.

The argument of bias&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; is mostly moot (but not comp=\r\nletely, of course). I personally get the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; feeling that these REST-*=\r\n moves were genuinly of good nature, the only&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; business bias that I=\r\n can see is that they jumped on an idea and went&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; with it. That&#39=\r\n;s more happening in the REST world in a long time, and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; as such I =\r\n*really* welcome it.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\nWould you welcome it if you we=\r\nnt to a car dealer, asked to see a&lt;br&gt;\nnew Camaro, and he insisted on showi=\r\nng you a Winnebago instead?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWould you welcome it if you went to Ma=\r\ncDonald&#39;s and ordered a&lt;br&gt;\nfilet-o-fish sandwich, and they gave you a =\r\nBig Mac instead?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWTF is wrong with you people?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nRed Hat (o=\r\nr, more accurately, JBoss) unilaterally decided to set&lt;br&gt;\nthemselves up as=\r\n the equivalent of Sun within a JCP-like standards&lt;br&gt;\norganization on a to=\r\npic for which they not only had NOTHING to&lt;br&gt;\ndo with creating and know NO=\r\nTHING about, but for which they&lt;br&gt;\nactually sell products that are the exa=\r\nct opposite of RESTful&lt;br&gt;\narchitecture.  The organization claims that it w=\r\nill specify REST&lt;br&gt;\nstandards, that such standards will be led by benevole=\r\nnt dictators&lt;br&gt;\nin the form of Spec Leads, that no overlapping proposals w=\r\nould be&lt;br&gt;\nallowed (IOW, the first Spec Lead owns the entire topic as BDFL=\r\n),&lt;br&gt;\nand that Red Hat would be the only permanent member of the board&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nto ensure that never changed.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAnd, guess what -- the organization=\r\n starts with a couple Spec Leads&lt;br&gt;\nowning the topics that JBoss wants to =\r\nSELL YOU as REST, because&lt;br&gt;\nthey know damn well that their current market=\r\n is shrinking: their&lt;br&gt;\nentire product architecture is based on J2EE, the =\r\ngiant black&lt;br&gt;\nhole of Java that is sucking itself into oblivion.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nBut, no, this won&#39;t be the oh-too-formal version of REST that&lt;br&gt;\nis f=\r\nound in my dissertation.  This will be the new, &quot;Pragmatic&quot;,&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nAssHat version of REST, so that JBoss can tell their customers&lt;br&gt;\nthat the=\r\ny are the new leaders in &quot;REST&quot; architecture and all&lt;br&gt;\nthey nee=\r\nd to do get their systems to be RESTful 2.0-compliant&lt;br&gt;\nis to buy their J=\r\n2EE application server, now with REST-beans.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquot=\r\ne class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204);=\r\n margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;background-co=\r\nlor: rgb(255, 255, 255);&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;width: 655px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;margi=\r\nn: 0pt; padding: 0pt 25px 0pt 0pt; width: 470px; float: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bill Bu=\r\nrke is not evangelizing REST throughout the Java world.&lt;br&gt;\nWhat he is evan=\r\ngelizing is the same old architectures that he&lt;br&gt;\nevangelized as J2EE and =\r\nWS-* -- the only difference is that now&lt;br&gt;\nhe starts off calling them REST=\r\n.  All he is doing is making&lt;br&gt;\npeople like you confused over what is REST=\r\n and what is not, in&lt;br&gt;\nthe hope of making a business out of clambering on=\r\nto yet&lt;br&gt;\nanother buzzword.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nNo, I see no reason to appreciate tha=\r\nt nonsense.
