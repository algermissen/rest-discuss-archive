My follow-ups are:\n&gt; &gt; Would &quot;ArticleTag&quot; not be appropriate, or was your choice \n&gt; just arbitrary?\n&gt; My choice was totally arbitrary.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; So I would PUT my option #1 (&quot;Just the tags the user wants assigned \n&gt; &gt; after they press submit&quot;), and I might also PATCH #2 (&quot;A list of \n&gt; &gt; changed tags&quot;) and POST #3 (&quot;All potential tags&quot;) if I \n&gt; really need those interactions?\n&gt;\n&gt; Again, for me, PUT makes the most sense. I am not up-to-speed \n&gt; on PATCH, check out the specs and the archives for more \n&gt; (http://www3.tools.ietf.org/html/draft-dusseault-http-patch-10).\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, I think of POST as a &#39;factory&#39; pattern. I use POST \n&gt; when I do not have a &quot;document name&quot; and am expecting the \n&gt; server to supply one.\n&gt; I use PUT when I want to allow/require the *client* to select \n&gt; a document name:\n&gt; \n&gt; PUT /tags/my-tags (creates a resource named &quot;my-tags&quot; at the \n&gt; /tags/ location POST /tags/ (creates a resource with a name \n&gt; created by the server (i.e. /tags/aXcd3)\n\nThanks!  That was all very helpful.\n\n&gt; &gt; ... Was your use of XML for an\n&gt; &gt; example just habit, or are you advocating it over the \n&gt; request/response \n&gt; &gt; forms of  &quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot;/&quot;JSON&quot; that I \n&gt; discussed?\n&gt;\n&gt;  My habit (sorry). JSON makes good sense if you plan on only \n&gt; doing this via Ajax calls. FWIW, I would point out that JSON \n&gt; is really the\n&gt; *representation* of your ArticleTag resource. form-encoding \n&gt; is really another representation of the same resource. XML, \n&gt; Atom, etc are just other representations. You might keep that \n&gt; in mind just in case - somewhere down the road - you want to \n&gt; _represent_ your article tags differently.\n\nYeah, as the fact that part of the project could get refactored out into a\ngeneric REST library for PHP I have in mind to offer the requestor the\nability to request different representation types when needed, while\nproviding JSON as the default.  Of course since my project&#39;s only need for\nthis is for AJAX I don&#39;t really have a need for those other representation\ntypes at the moment.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org \n\n\n"}}
