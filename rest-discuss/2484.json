This language in RFC 2396 was heuristic,\n&gt; and the idea that individuation and a persistent referenceable\n&gt; identity are intrinsic and universal in the Web, while central to the\n&gt; thinking of some people, did not at that time nor at this one reflect\n&gt; a globally valid interpretation of all the uses of URIs.\n\nI must admit I&#39;m a bit taken aback by this response, however ...\n\n&gt; And the distinction between things and stuffs is not at all\n&gt; irrelevant to building a reasonable engineering foundation for\n&gt; semantics for the Web.\n&gt;\n&gt; On the web we need to be able to refer to both stuffs and things.\n\n... even tho&#39; I don&#39;t have any particular metaphysical scruples when it \ncomes to stuffs and substances, I&#39;m afraid I simply don&#39;t buy this. \nStuffs probably have a useful place somewhere, but I think not here.\n\n&gt; We just discovered we needed to factor ACSS into perturbations of the\n&gt; text-to-speech transform, which is analogous to font characteristic\n&gt; manipulation, and sonicons that are used as punctuation for phrasal\n&gt; elements. Analogous to quotation marks and other punctuation which\n&gt; appear in the final stream as characters but this is because these\n&gt; controls are of such antiquity that there are standard glyphic\n&gt; characters for them.\n&gt;\n&gt; The moral here is that this points straight at a distinction between\n&gt; text and fills, which are styled as stuffs, and list elements and\n&gt; paragraphs and such, which are styled as things.\n&gt;\n&gt; If we comprehend this distinction at the outset, it would make the\n&gt; whole job of characterizing styling a lot easier, and the result more\n&gt; like natural language semantics.\n\nWhy are fills stuffs? Sure, I fill my pies with apple (apple-stuff, not \nindividual apples), but text is nothing like a pie. This is a physical \nanalogy too far: surely text-fills are properties. That gets you a \ncategorical distinction between text and fill ... but a different one.\n\n&gt; In particular, for my dump on how regarding a search URL as a\n&gt; reference to an identity is spurious, see\n&gt;\n&gt;   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/2001NovDec/0058.html\n&gt;\n&gt; It is just much more direct to view a search URL as subclassing a\n&gt; stuff and the server as returning references to things that exemplify\n&gt; the stuff that the user&#39;s URL described.\n\nI have no idea what &quot;subclassing a stuff&quot; could possibly mean. I do \nunderstand types and subtypes tho&#39;. And I&#39;ve no idea how a thing \n&quot;exemplifies&quot; a stuff. A thing might exemplify (I&#39;d prefer instantiate) \na property, but it&#39;s _made_ of stuff ... and that&#39;s a different kind of \nrelationship altogether.\n\nAre we talking at cross-purposes? Do you mean by stuff what I mean by \nproperty?\n\n&gt; The data of the &#39;dark Web&#39; is more practical to approach as stuff\n&gt; typed by tuples of properties than as entified things. Or at least\n&gt; that view matches application semantics better.\n&gt;\n&gt;   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/2000Apr/thread.html#18\n\nI can&#39;t see anything there which directly relates to this thread. Could \nyou give me an example?\n\nI can certainly see a case for properties having first class status on \nthe web, and I have no problem with properties counting as resources \nand having URIs. You&#39;d need, in effect a second-order version of,\n\n  A resource can be anything that has identity.\n\nbut it&#39;s also true that in almost all second-order systems,\n\n  (VX)(X = X)\n\n(ie. a second-order quantifier ranging over properties) is either an \naxiom or a theorem, so &quot;that has identity&quot; is _still_ redundant.\n\nI can&#39;t see any immediate role for stuffs tho&#39;, and the fact that \nthere&#39;s no well worked out formal theory of stuffs doesn&#39;t help either.\n\nCheers,\n\n\nMiles\n\n"}}
