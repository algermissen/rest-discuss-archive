Thanks!\n\nI&#39;m currently trying to develop a basic invoicing system but i=\r\n&#39;m having a bit of difficulty figuring out how best to represent invoices.\n=\r\n\nAn invoice is represented in the database as follows:\n\ninvoices: invoice_n=\r\no (pk), date, customer_id (fk)\n\nAn invoice has several rows or lines that i=\r\n have called invoice items. These are represented in the database as follow=\r\ns:\n\ninvoice_items: invoice_item_id (pk), cost, qty, details, invoice_no (fk=\r\n)\n\nThe invoices resource is available at:\n\n/invoices\n\nGET /invoices gives a=\r\n list of all the invoices on the system\n\nand you can:\n\nPOST /invoices to ad=\r\nd a new invoice.\n\nGET /invoices/1 gives a view of invoice 1 and all related=\r\n invoice_items\nPUT /invoices/1 to update it or\nDELETE /invoices/1 to delete=\r\n it (the db cascade deletes all related invoice_items)\n\nMy first thought wa=\r\ns that i should make invoice items availabe at the following:\n\n/invoices/1/=\r\ninvoice_items\n/invoices/1/invoice_items/[invoice_item_id]\n\nhowever, its see=\r\nms a lot easier and it simplifies my routing a bit if i just make invoices =\r\nitems available via\n\n/invoice_items/[invoice_id]\n\nI suppose it mean i can&#39;t=\r\n access the collection of invoice_items for a specific invoice directly via=\r\n any url but i already do that when i use GET /invoice/[invoice_id]\n\nI hope=\r\n that makes sense?\n\nI wondered if anyone had any comments / suggestions / c=\r\nriticisms of any of this?\n\nany help very much appreciated\n\nthanks\n\njim\n\n\n"}}
