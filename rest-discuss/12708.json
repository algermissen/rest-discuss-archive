I include myself among the guilty (as it were).\n\n&gt; [M=\r\naybe] I have to read the entire REST dissertation\n&gt; before I post something=\r\n.\n\nI don=E2=80=99t expect or demand that people read through =E2=80=9CArchi=\r\ntectural\nStyles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures=E2=\r\n=80=9D\n(&lt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm&gt;) befor=\r\ne\ntheir respective first postings, let alone before each posting. I do\nthin=\r\nk that solid preparation is in order. If a person can read English\nproficie=\r\nntly, a thorough reading of the dissertation is a great start to\nanswering =\r\nmany questions that the person might have about the\nRepresentational State =\r\nTransfer. The dissertation is available without\nfee to anybody with HTTP se=\r\nrvice. The writing is straightforward and\nreadily digestible. (The ideas th=\r\nat the writing presents may well be\nchallenging, but that=E2=80=99s a separ=\r\nate matter.)\n\n&gt; What you call misunderstanding is simply [an] imprecise use=\r\n of\n&gt; terminology. I wrote &quot;architectural constraints&quot; instead of &quot;sets of\n=\r\n&gt; architectural constraints&quot; and I said =E2=80=9Cinterface constraints=E2=\r\n=80=9D  instead\n&gt; of &quot;architectural constraints of the uniform interface&quot;. =\r\nDamn these\n&gt; simplifications....\n\nI appreciate the clarification. I gave yo=\r\nur message\n(&lt;http://tech.dir.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/12=\r\n519&gt;) a\nfifth reading. I still fail to detect the simplicity. I find that t=\r\nhe\nmessage implicitly draws distinctions where none exist and that the\nmess=\r\nage uses misnomers that offer no cognitive or lexical savings. (Yes,\nI unde=\r\nrstand that frank assessments in a textual medium are bound to\ngive offense=\r\n. No, I don=E2=80=99t intend to give offense. Yes, I tried other\nwordings i=\r\nn order to minimize the offense. No, none of those wordings\nhelped.)\n\n&gt; [Wh=\r\nat] strikes me is [that] you were so quick to point [to] such terrible\n&gt; fa=\r\nults[,] [yet] you said [nothing] in response to the original question[!]\n\nI=\r\n felt that the combination of your response\n(&lt;http://tech.dir.groups.yahoo.=\r\ncom/group/rest-discuss/message/12519&gt;)\nand my response\n(&lt;http://tech.groups=\r\n.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/12531&gt;) to\nyour response gave a corre=\r\nct, if not very helpful, answer to the\noriginal message\n(&lt;http://tech.dir.g=\r\nroups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/12513&gt;).\nThe writer of that orig=\r\ninal message admits to knowing little about REST\nbut, instead of asking for=\r\n materials that would teach him about REST per\nse, asks how to judge the co=\r\nnformance of a Web site to the style. Maybe\nhe=E2=80=99s trying to learn ab=\r\nout REST by example. But, if that is so, he=E2=80=99s\nasking for the knowle=\r\ndge that would obviate any need to learn by\nexample. Maybe he suspects (as =\r\nis true) that there exist criteria such\nthat failure to meet those criteria=\r\n is obvious even to the novice. But,\nif that is so, he=E2=80=99s asking for=\r\n knowledge that would highlight only Web\nsites which are not RESTful, thus =\r\nleaving all good examples to elude\nhim. Were I to respond to the writer of =\r\nthe original message, I would\nask about his ultimate goal.\n\n&gt; Gee, I though=\r\nt this list was about [trying] to help other people with\n&gt; their questions =\r\n[...]\n\nThe rest-discuss forum is for =E2=80=9C[general] discussion about\nRE=\r\npresentational State Transfer, the name given to the architectural\nstyle wh=\r\nich describes the best behaved subset of the World Wide Web\n(circa 1993), a=\r\ns determined by Roy Fielding=E2=80=9D [sic throughout]\n(&lt;http://tech.groups=\r\n.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/&gt;). That mandate\nleaves plenty of room for he=\r\nlping people with their questions. But\nquestions that are off topic deserve=\r\n either no response or gentle\npointers to appropriate fora. Questions that =\r\nshow a lack of basic\nresearch deserve gentle pointers to basic and informat=\r\nion. So, while\nthere=E2=80=99s no call for sour attitudes, there=E2=80=99s =\r\nno obligation to belabor\noneself in helping those who fail to help themselv=\r\nes, and there=E2=80=99s\ncertainly no obligation to help those who fail to r=\r\nespect the stated\nobject of discussion. A modicum of diligence goes a long =\r\nway.\n\n&gt; But[,] then again, [it] is much easier to point to [others&#39;] mistak=\r\nes than point to correct answers...\n\nYes, in general, it is much easier to =\r\nfind fault than to find correct\nanswers. In this case, though, issuing a co=\r\nrrect answer is trivial: an\narchitecture is RESTful if and only if the arch=\r\nitecture conforms to\nevery constraint of the Representational State Transfe=\r\nr. It is dubious,\nif not preposterous, that such an answer, albeit correct,=\r\n is helpful to\nthe beginner. Sometimes the best response to a question is a=\r\n question.\nWhen two men enter a drugstore and ask for advice and supplies s=\r\no that\nthe one can perform heart surgery on the other, a wise clerk avoids\n=\r\nrecommending this tool or that pain reliever. Instead, the wise clerk\nasks =\r\nwhy the sick man refuses treatment in a hospital and why his\nhealthy friend=\r\n believes that performing a home surgery on a vital organ\nis a good idea.
