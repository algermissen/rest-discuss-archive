If\n&gt; anyone has anything I would be interested. I started writing some\n&gt; thoughts at the link below, as a first pass based on some recent\n&gt; experiences.\n&gt;\n&gt; http://blog.technologyofcontent.com/2009/08/the-resource-oriented-enterprise/\n&gt;\n\nMy two killer business cases for REST are\n\n- the use of REST brings the decentralization aspects of the Web into\n   the enterprise world and allows designers and developers of networked\n   systems to create and evolve their components without the resource  \nand\n   time consuming effort of bringing them into a single room to  \ndiscuss APIs.\n   In geographically distributed organizations this might sometimes  \neven be\n   impossible.\n\n- the use of REST facilitates fragmented change. It deliberately  \nprovides room for\n   evolution (e.g. format extensions) that can bypass the main  \norganizational control.\n   Evolutions that turn out to be valuable can flow back into the main  \nline while others\n   silently die. No harm to ongoing communication between systems is  \ndone bei either\n   of those.\n\nOrganizations grow in size and geographically and IMO it makes perfect  \nsense to take\na technology that has seen extraordinary success over a decade and  \napply it to\ntoday&#39;s networked enterprise IT.\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; thanks\n&gt;\n&gt; Justin\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
