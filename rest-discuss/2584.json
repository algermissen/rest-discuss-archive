In \n&gt; other words, the client queries the portfolio resource by saying \n&gt; GET /Portfolio/?asof=2343232 and the server responds with HTTP 302 \n&gt; Found and in the Location header put the URL of the resource. If you \n&gt; have multiple resources that might be returned then do the same \n&gt; thing with the vanillar 200 OK.\n&gt; \n&gt; - itdp\n\nDon&#39;t you mean &quot;verniller&quot;?  And doesn&#39;t 302 mean kind of the\nreverse of what you&#39;re using it for here?\n\nThanks,\nWalden\n\n"}}
