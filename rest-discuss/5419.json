Mark Baker&#39;s RDF Forms is along these lines.\n\n\n&gt; If so, using some kind of forms language, does this also mean that I\n&gt; need to do this for every resource and method in my system, so should\n&gt; each representation of my widgets include some forms stuff saying what\n&gt; to PUT to update it?\n\nYes.  The tradeoff seems to be verbosity for runtime dynamicism.  In the\nterms used in section 2 of the REST thesis: Peformance for\nModifiability.\n\n\nBut it doesn&#39;t need to be hopelessly verbose.  Each page could have\nsomething like:\n\n    &lt;widgets xmlns:formlang=&quot;http://example.org/form-desc&quot; ...&gt;\n      &lt;formlang:operations href=&quot;/operations/widget-creation.desc&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;/widgets&gt;\n\nWhere that .desc resource is relatively static, aggressively cached and\nexpects clients to do conditional GET most of the time to make sure that\nthe resource-space-capabilities haven&#39;t changed since the last time they\nsaw the resource.\n\n...jsled\n-- \nhttp://asynchronous.org/ - `a=jsled; b=asynchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b}`\n\n"}}
