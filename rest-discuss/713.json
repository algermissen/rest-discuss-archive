It\n&gt; should be a time value that represents the time that the Subscriber\n&gt; Application would like the subscription to persist.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; and this:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Expiration: The response to the Subscription MUST include a header\n&gt; called &quot;Subscription-Expiration&quot;. This indicates the time that the\n&gt; subscription expires. The subscriber application MAY renew the\n&gt; subscription before this time. If it does not, the publisher MAY stop\n&gt; sending notifications after that time. The publisher MAY also remove the\n&gt; Subscription URI.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; and this:\n&gt;\n&gt; Renewal: The subscriber MAY renew a Subscription by making another\n&gt; Subscription Request.\n&gt;\n&gt; I will leave this in:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Each notification response MUST include a &quot;Continue-Subscription&quot;\n&gt; header. The value associated with this header MUST be the string &quot;true&quot;.\n&gt; If the header is not present, the publisher MUST remove the\n&gt; subscription.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; And subscriptions will be either one-shot or infinite, depending on how\n&gt; you look at it.\n&gt;\n&gt; ==========\n&gt;\n&gt; Should there be a way for the publisher to tell the subscriber when it\n&gt; (for whatever reason) will cease giving notifications? Sort of like the\n&gt; old unix sysadmin announcement: &quot;Going offline NOW!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; One way to handle this is to have the client register another URI, the\n&gt; &quot;subscription-cancellation URI&quot;. Another is to have a special HTTP\n&gt; method. Another is to just not worry about it. Applications can handle\n&gt; that out of band. I think I like that last option...\n&gt;\n&gt;  Paul Prescod\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
