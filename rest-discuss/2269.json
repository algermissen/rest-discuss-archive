Do your examples do that?  I guess the answer depends on \n&gt; &gt; whether &lt;transfer&gt; is an action or an artifact, but if the latter \n&gt; &gt; then it&#39;s pretty clearly an artifact of an action.\n&gt; \n&gt; Because of the context of the issue - that two different resources\n&gt; need to be updated in an atomic operation - the operation \n&gt; itself is &quot;meaningful&quot;, i.e., has internal structure and possible \n&gt; state, and *could* be given a URL.  If there was no need for the \n&gt; operation to be atomic, you could just do two GETs followed by two \n&gt; PUTs.  So I think this elevates it to being more than just some \n&gt; action or tricky way of dressing up an artifact of the action to \n&gt; hide its otherwise purely operational nature.\n&gt; \n&gt; If there is a better way of handling this I&#39;d also be very interested\n&gt; in seeing how to do it as it would provide more insight into REST.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; What if my application really does not care about keeping \n&gt; records of \n&gt; &gt; transfers, so there&#39;s no requirement to store transfer records and \n&gt; &gt; therefore no concept of subordinate resource?  In other words, \n&gt; &gt; there&#39;s just the act of transferring in real time.  Does \n&gt; that change \n&gt; &gt; the &quot;smell&quot; of the examples above?  Would you change your design of \n&gt; &gt; the application interface in light of that requirement \n&gt; clarification?\n&gt; \n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t. Again, given the context, I still think my example would \n&gt; make sense, but you don&#39;t necessarily need to create an actual \n&gt; resource and give it a URI.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the risk of again losing sight of the root issue though the \n&gt; introduction of yet another example, I can see this as analogous \n&gt; to a /bulliten-board resource where you don&#39;t necessarily need to \n&gt; provide URLs for each posted document. In that case a posted document \n&gt; is very clearly a subordinate resource, but in this specific \n&gt; context, I see the transaction as being a real resource too.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m looking for boundary examples for RESTfulness, i.e. \n&gt; hard cases to \n&gt; &gt; judge, if there is such a thing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Me too.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Jeff\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"}}
