It may not be a COMPLETE documentation of the API or\n&gt; t=\r\nhe service, but in and of itself and it&#39;s own little world view, it\n&gt; shoul=\r\nd be a relatively complete description, at least at rough level.\n&gt; \n&gt; If yo=\r\nu happen to be sending XML payload, XML Schema can fill in much\n&gt; of the de=\r\ntails.\n&gt; \n&gt; Assuming you can interpret the link references, possibly combin=\r\ned wit\n&gt; OPTIONS, then a client should be able to make available all of the=\r\n\n&gt; state transitions, as well as be able to create properly formatted,\n&gt; th=\r\nough not necessarily populated, payloads.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t know how any documen=\r\nt can communicate semantics to a machine,\n&gt; frankly. A Java doc, for exampl=\r\ne, auto generated from a class\n&gt; definition gives a nice, worthless summary=\r\n of a class. But it\n&gt; certainly has the information necessary to handle the=\r\n physical\n&gt; communication with that class.\n&gt; \nTotally agree with you.\n\nI th=\r\nink you misunderstood. I was not talking about documentation from server in=\r\n a normal interaction. I was talking about a framework to create clients, d=\r\nesign time.\n\nThe config or training data is to be given to the client when =\r\nit is being constructed, so it is prepared to handle the payload from the c=\r\nlient. \n\nThere is, and we cannot dismissed, a shared knowledge between clie=\r\nnt and server. That one that tells the client the account named field conta=\r\nins account data. That is not transferred in the actual interaction. It sho=\r\nuld be there before. And the idea is to have a base construct for the clien=\r\nt, that can read a config file (say, a mapping from names to fields in a da=\r\ntabase) so the client can &quot;understand&quot; the server requests. Is it that, or =\r\nhard code the data field names. See what I mean?\n\n\n&gt; &gt;(...)\n&gt; Code generati=\r\non exists because of a limitation of the static\n&gt; implementation languages.=\r\n Dynamic languages don&#39;t need code generation\n&gt; specifically because they&#39;r=\r\ne dynamic languages.\n&gt; \n\n Not sure I agree. Code generation is not actually=\r\n a product for static languages, but for the static code writing styles of =\r\ndevelopers.\n\n&gt; People can, and have, written dynamic interfaces to WSDL web=\r\n services,\n&gt; even for static languages. They&#39;re just a pain to use from the=\r\n coders\n&gt; point of view, and offer none of the value of a static language.\n=\r\n&gt; \n\nExact same thing I saying above: developer&#39;s fault.\n\n&gt; In either case, =\r\nwhether it&#39;s code generated or a client, I don&#39;t\n&gt; understand where you get=\r\n &quot;dynamically&quot; followed.\n&gt; \n&gt; If a schema changed, and eliminated previous =\r\nfields that your code was\n&gt; populating, that&#39;s an error. It could in theory=\r\n respond to new,\n&gt; optional but defaulted fields, but that&#39;s quite the edge=\r\n case in\n&gt; general IMHO.\n&gt; \n\nI actually do, and that is something I&#39;m worki=\r\nng on. You have not only dynamic interaction, but also dynamic payload crea=\r\ntion. Those are two different problems. We have tools with XSD and semantic=\r\n dictionaries to work the second one, plus server versioning, even code on =\r\ndemand. The first one we have other tools like Options and a out-of-band bu=\r\nsiness definition. If correctly done, a server may add a new field and the =\r\nclient should be able to handle that without error. \n\n&gt; So, I guess I&#39;m not=\r\n clear on how folks think a system can interact\n&gt; &quot;dynamically&quot; with anothe=\r\nr system when there&#39;s, in the end, some code\n&gt; somewhere driving the transa=\r\nction.\n&gt; \n\nExactly, simple follow rules with no hard code decisions, and al=\r\nl you need to change are the actions and/or the events.\n\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Wi=\r\nll Hartung\n&gt; (willh@...)\n&gt;\n\nCheers!\n\nWilliam Martinez Pomares\n\n\n"}}
