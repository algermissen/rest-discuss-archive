I still see\n&gt; rf:indexedB=\r\ny on your site[1]; is that by intention?\n\nindexedBy is still used for Index=\r\nables, but parameterizedWith (urgh,\nneeds a better name) is reserved for\n\nT=\r\nhe problem was that there was a closed world assumption being made\nthere by=\r\n sharing indexedBy between two incompatible uses.  i.e.\n\n&lt;http://example.or=\r\ng/query&gt; rf:indexedBy some:param\n\nby itself, is ambiguous because you don&#39;t=\r\n know the rdf:type of the\nsubject.  Keeping indexedBy for URI-parameterizat=\r\nion addresses that\nambiguity.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; What is the reason for adding rf:From an=\r\nd rf:method? Do they add\n&gt; capabilities not possible with Container, Indexa=\r\nble or Settable (are\n&gt; they intended to provide generic support for other m=\r\nethods, such as\n&gt; DELETE or WATCH)?\n\nYup, exactly.\n\n&gt; Now that you have rem=\r\noved the intent related parts, the genericity of\n&gt; POST is becoming very cl=\r\near (all you know about the resource that you\n&gt; send your data to is that i=\r\nt supports POST accepts certain media\n&gt; types. The shoe order example from =\r\nthe last version made it quite\n&gt; easy (at least for me) to miss the implici=\r\nt intent aspect.\n&gt;\n&gt; OTH...do you still think that the clients should/could=\r\n base their\n&gt; choice of container on additional information about known con=\r\ntainers\n&gt; (such as their type)?\n&gt;\n&gt; If not, what is your idea of how an app=\r\nlication should communicate to\n&gt; a client where to send the show-orders and=\r\n where to send refund\n&gt; requests for bad shoes?\n\nHmm, the &quot;intent&quot; stuff wa=\r\ns just to permit the client to declare\npre-conditions in the message for th=\r\ne processing of the data in that\nmessage.  The previous version of the spec=\r\n associated the rdf:type of\nthe processing resource, as declared via the fo=\r\nrm, to that\ninformation, but it needn&#39;t be the only information the client =\r\nuses to\nbase its decision upon, nor reflect as a pre-condition in the messa=\r\nge.\n\nSo to answer your question, the application should use different URIs\n=\r\nto do those things.\n\nMark.\n--\nMark Baker.
