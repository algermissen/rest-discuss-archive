How is an event source going to communicate with\nthe callback sink?  What happens if the sink is on the other side of the firewall?\n\n&gt; All existing ideas on how to do callbacks have centered on a callback URI.\n&gt; There&#39;s a source that has an event to post, to make that happen it sends some\n&gt; bytes to the sink callback URI; the sink is running a server on the callback\n&gt; IP:port.  This is exactly the same in PSP as in full scale HTTP 1.1.   In fact,\n&gt; neither can pass through the firewall.\n\nThis is absolutely true.\n\n&gt; Firewalls are a completely separate conversation.  PSP is merely and only a\n&gt; means of implementing callbacks without introducing new security problems.\n\nI think it solves a non-problem.  The only justification for PSP as a separate\nprotocol from HTTP is to put it on another port where it can be separated from and\nprocessed independently of HTTP for the purpose of securing administrative\nboundaries.  If not that purpose, there&#39;s no point in introducing a separate\nprotocol.\n\n&gt; (Uh, actually there&#39;s one tiny difference between UDP and TCP servers for the\n&gt; purposes of breaking into the firewall -- UDP can sometimes pass through NATs.\n&gt; That&#39;s a trivial difference that isn&#39;t consistently enough available to care\n&gt; about, which is why I didn&#39;t mention it.)\n\nActiverse&#39;s event protocol was UDP-based.  This was problematic.\n\njb\n\n\n\n\n"}}
