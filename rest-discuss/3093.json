For\ninstance, suppose you were to do a GET on:\n\n    http://sample.org/foo?bar\n\nWhen getting the response, the server returned headers something like:\n\nLocation: http://sample.org/foo\nQuery: bar\nVaries: Query\n\nIn this case, it is saying that the value of Location is the URI that\nidentifies the resource.  The query string is stored in another header so\nthat the Varies header can indicate it for caching purposes, etc.\n\nOf course, my understanding of HTTP headers has only recently into Varies,\nLocation, etc., so this may not be an appropriate way of handling this.\nJust a thought...\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Miles Sabin&quot; &lt;miles@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;rest-discuss&quot; &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, December 18, 2002 5:00 AM\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] Representation format as part of URIs?\n\n\n&gt; Roy T. Fielding wrote,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2396 is not clear about that. It says:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;3.4. Query Component\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    The query component is a string of information to be interpreted\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    by the resource.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yes, but it doesn&#39;t say that the resource is identified by what comes\n&gt; &gt; before the query component.\n&gt;\n&gt; True, but puzzling.\n&gt;\n&gt; If the resource is identified by the whole URI then,\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. http://www.example.com/foo?bar\n&gt;\n&gt; and,\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. http://www.example.com/foo?baz\n&gt;\n&gt; identify two distinct resources R1 and R2, in which case there doesn&#39;t\n&gt; seem to be very much &quot;interpretation&quot; to be done: &quot;?bar&quot; is encoded\n&gt; into the identifier for R1 and &quot;?baz&quot; is encoded into the identifier\n&gt; for R2, so any further inspection of the query component by either\n&gt; resource would be redundant.\n&gt;\n&gt; Whatever the currently preferred understanding of the relationship\n&gt; between URIs, resources and representations, 3.4 only really makes any\n&gt; sense if we treat the prefix,\n&gt;\n&gt;    http://www.example.com/foo\n&gt;\n&gt; as identifying a _process_ and the query component as specifying an\n&gt; argument to be provided to that process.\n&gt;\n&gt; But that pretty clearly isn&#39;t your currently preferred understanding,\n&gt; which, even if it&#39;s not strictly speaking inconsistent with 3.4,\n&gt; certainly seems to be in tension with it. So maybe 3.4 needs tweaking?\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Miles\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
