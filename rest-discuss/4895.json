An &quot;empathic&quot; definition would be &quot;Simple HTTP API almost like REST\n&gt; but Easier&quot;. My definition would be &quot;Simple HTTP API that&#39;s Really Easy&quot;.\n\nMy point has been that SHARE APIs are (sometimes) _NOT_ &quot;almost like\nREST&quot;.\n\n\n&gt; - Supports GET, POST, HEAD only. The recommended method is only GET\n&gt; though, for accessibility: You can&#39;t do a POST using a web browser without\n&gt; using forms, and you can&#39;t do a POST using a script without using special\n&gt; libraries, client-side JavaScript such as using XMLHTTP did not support\n&gt; POST until later versions.\n\nMy argument is that -- from what we&#39;ve seen so far -- either GET _or_\nPOST is being used.  HEAD doesn&#39;t really seem to be used by any of these\nservices.\n\nIn terms of recommendation, it&#39;d have to be the much safer POST\noperation, not GET.\n\n\n&gt; - Has a SHARE Description (SHARED) which basically looks like RSDL I\n&gt; proposed before.\n\nNo.  I&#39;m trying to describe the existing world, not prescribe a new one.\n\n\n&gt; - Has a SHARE interface description which is written in WSDL, I suppose...\n&gt; but I&#39;ll think about it later. It&#39;s just too early.\n\nNo. The SHARE interfaces we&#39;ve seen so far have been described in prose\nin HTML as a rule, actually.\n\n\nNo offense, but /please/ don&#39;t co-opt this term as the name of your\ndesign for doing RPC via HTTP.  My whole point of coining the term was\nto describe the *class* of recently-emergant APIs that have adopted the\ndescription &quot;REST&quot; without necessarily following its constraints.  I&#39;d\nreally like the term to be a bit more abstract than &quot;it has this\n[Interface] Description Language, and these encoding rules, and ...&quot;\nwith a spec and a website.\n\n...jsled\n\n-- \nhttp://asynchronous.org/ - `a=jsled; b=asynchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b}`\n\n"}}
