I would like to\n&gt; be able to merge the two accounts, say:\n&gt;\n&gt;   http://myservice//account/1:\n&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;account id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;savings&gt;100&lt;/savings&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;checking&gt;200&lt;/checking&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;/account&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   http://myservice//account/2:\n&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;account id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;savings&gt;50&lt;/savings&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;checking&gt;75&lt;/checking&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;/account&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Such that the result is a single resource:\n&gt;\n&gt;   http://myservice/account/1:\n&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;account id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;savings&gt;150&lt;/savings&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;checking&gt;275&lt;/checking&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;/account&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The second account is silently deleted.\n&gt;\n&gt; While I could perform the updates on the client\n&gt; and post/put the new representations back to the server,\n&gt; I would not have any auditing on what actions where\n&gt; performed against the accounts, nor that they were\n&gt; done in a single transaction.\n&gt;\n&gt; Instead I&#39;d like to POST to some &quot;transaction&quot; resource,\n&gt; say /merge, and create a new resource that represents\n&gt; the transaction details\n&gt;\n&gt;   Request:\n&gt;\n&gt;   POST /merge/ HTTP/1.1\n&gt;   Host: http://myservice\n&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;accounts&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;account id=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;account id=&quot;2&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;/accounts&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   Response:\n&gt;\n&gt;   HTTP/1.1 204 Created\n&gt;   Location: http://myservice/merge/93914\n&gt;\n&gt; POSTing would perform the required merge, and the\n&gt; created resource would be a record of the transaction.\n&gt;\n&gt; The only available operation on the created\n&gt; resource would be GET since it only holds the transaction\n&gt; details.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does this violate principle #4 above?  What other\n&gt; solutions would there be otherwise?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
