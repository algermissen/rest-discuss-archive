A single\n: : &gt; artist resource might be more like /Artist/123.  An important\n: : &gt; question is: how does the client discover that URI?  The &quot;hyptertext\n: : &gt; engine&quot; constraint of REST really wants it to be discovered, not\n: : &gt; fabricated by client as a parameter list.\n: :\n: : Why is discovery of a particular URI &quot;better&quot; than discovery of the\n: construction technique for a URI?  This argues that HTML FORM GETs are a\nbad\n: way of creating URIs because they are fabricated.\n: :\n:\n: It depends on what you&#39;re trying to do, and how much error you&#39;re\n: willing to tolerate.\n:\n: You use GET FORMs to identify sets of resources, where the form\n: fields correspond to the bound variables of a set comprehension.  And\n: when you search like that, you have one set of expectations, including\n: the possibility that you&#39;ll find nothing.\n:\n: In a different context, the one we were discussing above where you\n: are trying to retrieve a known individual, a URI formula or construction\n: technique would only introduce uncertainty, whereas an immutable\n: string id is just the ticket.\n:\n: To put that concept to the test, consider how much you&#39;d like the web\n: if all the links were replaced by forms that required you to type naming\n: minutiae without error, in order to progress.\n:\n: Your question is interesting: it caused me to think about to what degree\n: forms qualify as &quot;hypertext&quot;.  Does anyone have an opinion on that?\n:\n: Walden\n:\n\n\n"}}
