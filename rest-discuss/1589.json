This is just like CGI.\n&gt; Which is the source of many &quot;verb&quot; based designs on the web.  The implication I\n&gt; get in this section of the document (sect 5.2.3) is that while representations\n&gt; of resources are transferred to user agents directly from the origin server,\n&gt; method invocation is encapsulated away from the origin server and behind a\n&gt; gateway.  Do you get that implication as well?\n\nI agree. And in fact a CGI is more REST-y if it is used to expose\nresources rather than used as an endpoint target for method invocations.\n\nOne strong indication that Fielding et al. did not anticipate that\nresources would be methods is that resources are things with state. The\ncombination of state and behaviour is commonly called an &quot;object&quot;: &quot;In\nobject-oriented programming, objects include data and the procedures\nnecessary to operate on that data.&quot; -- geez I love dictionary.com.\n\nIn REST, resources have state and the procedures associated with them\nare exposed as HTTP methods. The state is updated or retrieved through\nrepresentations.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
