If a resource can be\n&gt; represented by more than one entity, then it follows logically that a\n&gt; given entity representing it in a PUT operation would not necessarily be\n&gt; the same as that representing it in a particular GET operation. By\n&gt; extension, it may not be the same as any GET operation at all.\n\nIMO, that&#39;s not the reason.  Even without conneg, you&#39;d still have\nthis issue.  You could also imagine a distributed file system *with*\nconneg where &quot;store&quot; request entities could be used to respond to\n&quot;retrieve&quot; requests for the same media type.\n\nReally, when you think about it, the question is a bit silly; no where\nin the protocol is it specified that there&#39;s any relationship between\na PUT request and a GET response, and that means there isn&#39;t one.  The\n*reason* for this, I believe, is due to the generality of the\ninterface; PUT means the minimum it needs to mean to be a\nstate-setting method, and that minimum provides no expectation about\nwhat future GET requests might look like... unlike in the distributed\nfile system example.\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
