(was Re: DELETE\ncontainer?)\n\n\n&gt; S. Alexander Jacobson wrote,\n&gt; &gt; DELETEing a URL should simply mean that you can no longer GET or POST\n&gt; &gt; to it.  Adding arbitrary side effects just makes it more complex to\n&gt; &gt; interact with your application.\n&gt;\n&gt; It also has the potential to interact interestingly with DELETE&#39;s\n&gt; idempotence.\n&gt;\n&gt; FWIW, slightly related: the strawman &quot;proof&quot; I gave here,\n&gt;\n&gt;   http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/2349\n&gt;\n&gt; that all sequences of idempotent requests are idempotent sequences\n&gt; relies on the assumption that URIs are independent irrespective of any\n&gt; shared lexical prefix. Clearly this proof fails if that assumption is\n&gt; false.\n&gt;\n&gt; I can&#39;t remember if Walden&#39;s Alloy model made the same assumption.\n&gt; Walden?\n\nThe model I posted was extremely abstract, as you may recall,\ntreating &quot;function&quot; in the relational sense of a mapping, which we\nunderstood to represent a state transition for some resource or\nanother.  There&#39;s no expressive power in a model like that for the\nconcept of parallel state transitions on other resources, all wrapped\nup in a single operation.\n\nIn short, yes, by dint of minimal expressiveness.\n\nWalden\n\n\n"}}
