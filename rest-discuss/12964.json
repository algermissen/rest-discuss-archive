Create\n&gt; PUT ...../Groups/GroupName\n&gt; NO PAYLOAD in the BODY\n\nIf you are ok with client controlled resource URLs - this is &quot;WebDAV \nstyle&quot;, different from &quot;AtomPub style&quot; where the server defines the URL \nfor the group.\n\n&gt; 2. RENAME\n&gt; POST ..../Groups/ID\n&gt; &lt;GroupName&gt;NewName&lt;/GroupName&gt;\n\nThis is a subtle issue, but would renaming the group change its URL? IOW \nis that a deliberate design decision, or a side-effect of client \ncontrolled URLs?\n\nAlso, the protocol lacks symmetry - how you send the group name during \ncreation is different from how you send it for a rename.\n\n&gt; 3. GET Group\n&gt; GET ..../Groups/GroupName\n&gt; GET ..../Groups/GroupID\n\nSomeone will have to write code on the server to distinguish between \nlookups by id and name.\n\n\n&gt; 4. GET ..../Groups\n&gt; &lt;Groups&gt;&lt;Group&gt;&lt;ID&gt;&lt;NAME&gt;////\n\nA REST based format would contain links to the groups as well and a \nmedia type for the XML.\n\n&gt; 5. Get users of a group\n&gt; GET ..../Groups/GroupName/Users?\n\nbased on 3 you would need to support GroupID/Users as well.\n\n&gt; 6. Add user to a group\n&gt; POST ..../Groups/GroupName/Users\n\nThis is different to way you add a group to the groups. Wny?\n\nBill\n\n\nBill\n\n"}}
