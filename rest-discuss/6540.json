Ergo: we must be reading\n&gt;the advice in the wrong context.\n&gt;\n\nIf by infinite recursion you&#39;re referring to Russell&#39;s Paradox, I don&#39;t see \nhow it applies here, where we are debating whether a box with two apples is \none box or a box divided in two sections -- not whether it&#39;s one box or \nan infinite number of boxes.\n\nFrom the user-agent perspective, one resource returns multiple \nrepresentations, from the server perspective I see those variants as their \nown resources.  So I think it&#39;s important to model a system as if those were \nunique resources, whether or not those identifiers are opaque to the client.\n\n-Eric\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Walden\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
