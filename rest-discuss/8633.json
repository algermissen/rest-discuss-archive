I was just making the point that anyone reading what you\n&gt; say who might interpret it as advocacy would be mistaken.\n\nA fair enough point.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; There isn&#39;t much talk about Content Negotiation on the list,\n&gt; &gt; but I don&#39;t think that REST is complete without it. Or at\n&gt; &gt; least bcomes a pale shadow of itself.\n&gt;\n&gt; Why?\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; REST shouldn&#39;t advocate the use of a single MIME type either\n&gt; &gt; - otherwise we will end up repeating the WS-* world, where\n&gt; &gt; everyting is a SOAP message, and the SOAP spec becomes ever\n&gt; &gt; more convoluted.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think I agree with you, but can you be more specific?\n\nOne of the key constraints stipulated by Roy is the separation of\nconcerns between client and server. Having a specialised message\nformat would breach this constraint by coupling client and server. To\navoid this fate, &#39;agnostic&#39; MIME types are required - that is to say,\nMIME types that can be used generally for the type of application\nfunctionality.\n\nIf you were to say &quot;RESTful applications must use this specific MIME\ntype&quot; then I believe that you run the very real risk of &quot;satisfying\nnobody by trying to please everybody&quot;.\n\nThe more functionality that you try to embed into a format, then the\nmore cumbersome and unwieldy it becomes - this is the fate of SOAP.\nWhat was originally intended to be Simple is now anything but.\n\nBetter to establish a pattern for RESTful MIME types, and then provide\nformats on as as-needed basis that adhere to that pattern.\n\nFor example, another constraint of REST as set out by Roy is that the\nclient stores session state and that &quot;each request from client to\nserver must contain all the information necessary to understand the\nrequest, and cannot take advantage of any stored context on the\nserver.&quot; This begs for a MIME type pattern, imho.\n\nLet&#39;s say that a RESTful MIME type for e-commerce baskets had been\ndevised. The client can discover if the server supports said MIME type\nby simply pinging the server with:\n\n-&gt;\nGET /\nAccept: application/basket\n\nIf the server does not support the basket MIME type, it simply responds:\n\n&lt;-\n406 Not Acceptable\n\nIf the server does support the basket MIME type, then it could return\nan empty basket, laden with the hyperlinks to the basket URI-space on\nthe server:\n\n&lt;-\n200 OK\nContent-Type: application/basket\n\n&lt;basket xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n   &lt;product href=&quot;/fruit&quot;&gt;Fruit&lt;/product&gt;\n&lt;/basket&gt;\n\nHope that helps illuminate what my thoughts are.\n\nRegards,\nAlan Dean\nhttp://thoughtpad.net/alan-dean\n\n"}}
