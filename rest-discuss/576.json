We are having a miscommunication.\n&gt; The scenario I am describing is one in which the\n&gt; client has some intermediary that takes care of\n&gt; listening for notification messages (that hosts\n&gt; listeners).

I just think we shouldn&#39;t necessarily specify listener\nmanagement in the same context as just plain notifications.  With you all the way to (6)\nwith the exception that we aren&#39;t assuming NOTIFY, we&#39;re assuming POST.\n\n&gt; 6. client requests changes by e.g.\n&gt;      http://intermediarty.com/getLogs?user=client\n&gt;\n\nResource model alert!  I have no idea what this means. ;-)\n\n&gt; 7. client decides that foo.com info is really\n&gt;    important and would like to be sent a page\n&gt;    when foo.com changes.  Client issues a POST\n&gt;    to\n&gt;      http://intermediary.com/~client/subcription1\n\nI think that this has to be something other than POST, as the POST on that resource\nindicates changes on http://foo.com.\n\n&gt; 8. client is no longer interested in goo.com and\n&gt;    does\n&gt;    DELETE http://intermediary.com/~client/subcription2\n\nNo problem.\n\n&gt; 9. intermdiary recieves another NOTIFY message at\n&gt;      http://intermediary.com/~client/subcription2\n&gt;    and now responds with a 404 Not Found.\n\nFine, with the exceptions noted above.  Can&#39;t assume NOTIFY.  It&#39;s a bad idea, because\nnot all resources are listeners.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
