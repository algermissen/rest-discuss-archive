I&#39;m utterly convinced \n&gt;&gt; HTML forms is the most damaging Web technology \n&gt;&gt; standard ever conceived - it demands. Nothing else is \n&gt;&gt; remotely close. It&#39;s confused maybe half a dozen web \n&gt;&gt; technologies (cgi, browsers, SOAP/WS, xml-rpc, \n&gt;&gt; web-mvc, Web2.0 apis). It coerces developers to the \n&gt;&gt; do the wrong thing; either with apps or framework designs.\n\nHad you, with a clean slate and knowning what you know today, been given the\nprivledge of designing the functionalty that HTML forms provides, how would\nyou have designed them/what would you have done differently?  In addition,\ngiven legacy constraints, what would you do to fix them if you were to write\nthe spec?\n\n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
