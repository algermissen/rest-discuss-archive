It should be obvious. You&#39;re being\n&gt; asked to /keep it in mind/ when considering &quot;how orderly&quot; the\n&gt; evolution should be.\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;m asking you to keep in mind that truly useful new types don&#39;t happen\nby chance -- throwing a bunch of application-specific types against the\nwall to see what sticks is the opposite of the principled design REST\nrepresents.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The rate a which a media type will go from new to faded away will be\n&gt; determined by the value it provides to the system.\n&gt;\n\nI don&#39;t care how much value a custom type adds to the system, if the\nresult is a library-based unique interface that&#39;s never intended to be\nstandardized, then it isn&#39;t part of the uniform interface, never will\nbe, and is therefore not the same thing as the REST style.  The value\nof any media/data type to REST development is a product of how useful\nit is *in general* not how well-optimized it is for the application at\nhand.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Basically, you are getting your knickers in a twist about nothing\n&gt; because (assuming you are correct, of course) application-specific\n&gt; media types are essentially superfluous, will not survive, and\n&gt; therefore won&#39;t have any long-term impact on the system. Not only\n&gt; that, there&#39;s also a chance that during the &#39;chaos&#39; some useful\n&gt; long-lasting types do emerge and survive as the fittest. That is\n&gt; evolution.\n&gt; \n\nYou describe chaos, where out of 1,000 new types one or two may\naccidentally prove to have value in a generic fashion despite not\nhaving been designed to be generic.  What data type which *is* part of\nthe uniform interface was designed in such an accidental, haphazard\nfashion?  The useful types, over the long-term, are those that are\ndesigned to be of general use and subjected to peer review through a\nstandards process.  Where are the benefits of REST, in a system composed\nof custom types that won&#39;t survive?  Surely there&#39;s less long-term\nimpact to a system that doesn&#39;t need to be refactored in order to ever\nachieve those benefits.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Evolution doesn&#39;t require - or benefit from - careful &quot;expert&quot;\n&gt; orchestration by militant prophets of The One True Way. Sorry.\n&gt; \n\nExactly the opposite of what the thesis implies by referring to this:\n\n&quot;A registration process is needed, however, to ensure that the set of\nsuch values is developed in an orderly, well-specified, and public\nmanner.&quot;\n\nAre you suggesting that the ietf-types list and the registry are\narchitecturally unsound?  The standards tree is based on exactly the\nexpert orchestration you decry.  Evolution of new standardized types\nhappens by design, not random chance based on disorderly, unspecified\nand private processes.  REST and HTTP offer coherent arguments against\nthrowing new types at the wall to see what sticks, which is a weak\nargument in support of creating custom types for every application,\nunguided by any process and ignorant of existing standardized types\ncapable of solving the same problem *without* abandoning the uniform\ninterface by hoping against reason that types developed in such fashion\nmight accidentally represent an improvement and be widely adopted.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
