You&#39;ve been here long enough to know that Seairth!\n&gt; 8-O With REST, you&#39;re constrained to using methods that you could\n&gt; use on anything.  So &quot;CREATE&quot; isn&#39;t a REST method, because I\n&gt; don&#39;t know what it would mean to invoke that on a URI identifying\n&gt; a stock quote.\n\nOne of the big benefits that one should receive from taking a RESTful\napproach is purification and simplification of an otherwise ugly situation\nthat will only get uglier.  If Groove uses &#39;Create&#39;, then someone else will\nuse &#39;myCreate&#39;, then someone else will use hungarian notiation with\n&#39;urilstCreate&#39;, and then in a few years we circle back to the same recursive\nscope creep scenario that led to the creation of SOAP in the first place.\nPeople agreeing on HTTP and its verbs is a key success factor of REST.\n \n&gt; This is a severe constraint on *form*, but does not in any way\n&gt; constrain *function*. i.e. every problem has a solution with a\n&gt; system built with this constraint in mind.\n\nI went back and read the entire article [1], written by Jon Udell at\nInfoWorld.  I can&#39;t tell if my problem comes from what I perceive as a\nwriter trying to sound smart, Groove trying to cash in on hype, or from\nthose who created the notion of RESTful SOAP trying to start a riot.\n\nUdell says GWS is a textbook example of &quot;RESTful SOAP&quot; - is that good or\nbad?  To elaborate on what that means, he references the SOAP 1.2 working\ndraft, saying that URIs should be used as resource identifiers.  DUH!!  Then\ncomes this paragraph:\n\n   For example, the root of GWS is a SOAP service with an address\n   like http://localhost:9080/GWS/Groove/1.0/Accounts. Since a\n   Groove account is a container of identities, a Read operation\n   on this resource produces an XML document that enumerates them.\n   Each identity includes an element like\n   /GWS/Groove/1.0/Spaces/grooveIdentity/123...xyz -- that is, the\n   URI of the SOAP service that enumerates the shared spaces for\n   that identity. Traversal of spaces, tools, and data proceeds\n   in a similar fashion. It&#39;s all organized as a web of linked\n   XML documents controlled by a handful of verbs such as Create,\n   Read, Update, and Delete.\n\nFirst (if I was claiming to be RESTful), I would replace every instance of\n&#39;SOAP service&#39; with &#39;resource&#39;.  Then, I would replace &#39;Create, Read,\nUpdate, and Delete&#39; with &#39;PUT, GET, POST, and DELETE&#39;.  To clarify my point,\nI might reword the last sentence to say &quot;...web of linked resources accessed\nby a handful of verbs that allow you to create, read, update, and delete\nthem.&quot;  I would then elaborate on the connection between a RESTful style and\nHTTP and make sure I reference Fielding&#39;s thesis.\n\nPhilip\n\n1. http://www.infoworld.com/articles/pl/xml/02/11/04/021104plgroove.xml\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nThis e-mail may contain confidential and/or privileged information.
