Translating those  \ndiffs to the database layer can get expensive/complex, unless such  \ntranslation is implicit in the programming framework of choice. Before  \ncasting the problem as that of &quot;partially updating *a* resource&quot;, it  \nmay be cheaper to either adjust the granularity of resources or  \nidentify special-purpose (i.e. application specific) resources that  \ncan make such updates to resources. The same goes for batch use cases  \nas well.\n\nSubbu\n\nOn Jan 8, 2009, at 10:20 PM, Stefan Tilkov wrote:\n\n&gt; The upside, of course, is the separation of concerns: Once you&#39;ve\n&gt; defined a diff format for e.g. JSON, you can throw in two (or three)\n&gt; documents and generate the diff document, or you can apply a diff as a\n&gt; PATCH - and it will work for any content as long as it&#39;s serialzed as\n&gt; JSON . And as media types and verbs are two different domains, PATCH\n&gt; doesn&#39;t even have to know about any particular data format.\n&gt;\n&gt; BTW, this is James Snell&#39;s latest PATCH draft, I believe:\n&gt; http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-dusseault-http-patch-11.txt\n&gt;\n&gt; Stefan\n&gt; --\n&gt; Stefan Tilkov, http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/\n&gt;\n&gt; On 09.01.2009, at 03:59, Bill Burke wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; vincent.lari wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A diff format seems like overengineering at its finest.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Not if you care about the uniform interface, and this being\n&gt;&gt;&gt; rest-discuss...\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It is both overengineering and I&#39;ll add, over complicated.

But think of the implications of general\n&gt;&gt; applications, specifically database centric ones. With a general diff\n&gt;&gt; model you have to transform from the database to your language, then\n&gt;&gt; transform from your language to the data format, then apply the the\n&gt;&gt; diff\n&gt;&gt; transformation, then bring it back into your language for any  \n&gt;&gt; business\n&gt;&gt; logic processing, then finally back to the database.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Think of how much complication something like this causes for your\n&gt;&gt; client code as well? If you start requiring the every-day developer  \n&gt;&gt; to\n&gt;&gt; generate and deal with more artifacts than what you have with WS-*\n&gt;&gt; you&#39;re not going to make much headway.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Bill\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; -- \n&gt;&gt; Bill Burke\n&gt;&gt; JBoss, a division of Red Hat\n&gt;&gt; http://bill.burkecentral.com\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
