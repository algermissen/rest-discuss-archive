This keeps you from\n&gt; having to get the entire resource.\n\nNo doubt the contents have changed.  The issue is\nthat since I know the contents simply grow, if I\nprohibited the server from changing URLs, I could\nretrieve only the new messages by using range\nheaders to retrieve all content beyond the\ncontent-length I have received so far.\n\nThe problem here is how to retrieve only the new\nmessages if the length of old messages changes\n(perhaps because of changes in the length of the\nURLs to which the metadata points).\n\n&gt; 2) There is nothing in REST that says the URI must identify a specific\n&gt; directory location.  As a result, you could create the necessary URIs up\n&gt; front and just keep an internal map to the actual location.  If the server\n&gt; wants to move an attachment, it just needs to update the map.  The URI will\n&gt; still &quot;point to&quot;  the attachment (i.e. the resource/representation isn&#39;t any\n&gt; different).  If you are doing this across multiple web servers, you could\n&gt; also use the map table to instead return an appropriate HTTP 301 &quot;Moved\n&gt; Permanently&quot; or 302 &quot;Found&quot; to redirect the client to the actual URI.\n\nI&#39;m not sure I understand what you mean.  I\nsuppose I could commit to a metadata format that\ndoes not actually include the actual URL but\nintead includes the URL of a redirect to the\nactual URL, but that doubles server round trips\nand I would like to avoid that as well.\n\n&gt; 3) I am uneasy about the range feature of HTTP.  It doesn&#39;t feel very\n&gt; extensible to me (e.g. if you message format changed, range calculations\n&gt; would have to change as well).\n\nYes, that is exactly why range headers don&#39;t\nappear to be an answer to the question I am\nasking.\n\n&gt; 4) (this is more of a question to the whole list) Would it be RESTful to\n&gt; maintain a resource whose response to a GET only contained the new items?\n&gt; For instance, suppose after each successful GET of a mail message, the\n&gt; client were to POST the URI to this resource.  On a GET of this resource,\n&gt; the server would return all message URIs for which it had not been notified\n&gt; of by the POST(s).  This technique would also obviate the need for the HTTP\n&gt; range technique.\n\nHmm, this looks interesting.  A variant of this\nproposal would be for the server to return the URL\nat which it will serve the next set of messages\neven if those messages don&#39;t yet exist... I&#39;m not\nsure how RESTful that would be either.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.

There may be a large\n&gt; &gt; number of messages and, ideally, I only want the\n&gt; &gt; client to retrieve new messages.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Again, my initial instinct here was that I could\n&gt; &gt; use range-headers (because the mailbox only\n&gt; &gt; grows), but, even if I just return metadata, I\n&gt; &gt; want to give the server the option of moving the\n&gt; &gt; actual messages to different URLs.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the new\n&gt; &gt; URL will have the same length as the old.  So\n&gt; &gt; changing all the URLs in the folder could\n&gt; &gt; radically change its length, thereby precluding\n&gt; &gt; use of range headers to get new messages.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Does this make sense now?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -Alex-\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; PS I really want the server to be able to choose\n&gt; &gt; on a per-message basis whether to return the\n&gt; &gt; whole message or simply a URL but URL changes\n&gt; &gt; illustrate my pount sufficiently well.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ___________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; S.
