For example, requesting the \n&gt; current balance for a credit card:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.bank.com/statements?number=1234567890984567\n&gt;\n&gt; Assume HTTP authentication is being used, but we might still wish to \n&gt; avoid shoulder surfing.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is it acceptable to use POST here to hide the number from prying eyes, \n&gt; or should this still be GET? Why or why not?\n\nIt should be GET.\n\nYour credit card number isn&#39;t secret. You hand it over to all sorts of\nstrangers every day.\n\nTo address the point of shoulder surfing: if someone is standing\nbehind you at an ATM looking over your shoulder do you:\n\na) carry on typing in your pin?\nb) turn round, write the pin on a piece of paper and give to the\nsurfer?\nc) stop entering your pin, even if you have to go to another machine\nsomewhere else?\n\nAnd when you get your statement are you still going to be standing\nthere with the shoulder surfer? Because the resource you&#39;re looking at\nmay well have the account number in it. How are you going to stop them\nlooking at that? Maybe a sudden distraction? try throwing a cat across\nthe table.\n\n\nI&#39;ve been asked these sorts of things a lot by people connected with\nprojects. They all seem to come from a desire to be secure... but with\nno realistic view of security. Security through obscurity is no\nsecurity etc...\n\nThe really bad thing about things like that is that they cause\narchitectural problems. I have many times come to a developed system\nthat is broken architecturally only to find out that underlying the\nbreak is something spurious that is the way it is because &quot;it just\nis&quot;. Inevitably, it&#39;s something like the above.\n\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
