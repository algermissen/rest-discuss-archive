Fielding wrote:\n&gt; &gt;My bad.  But my point remains; that RESTfully, resources cannot be\n&gt; &gt;expected to process, say, XQuery documents and return the results of \n&gt; &gt;the\n&gt; &gt;specified query in the POST response, or in the form of another\n&gt; &gt;resource, or anyplace else for that matter, since providing such an\n&gt; &gt;expectation is not uniform.\n&gt; \n&gt; They can if the server told the client that such is expected.\n&gt; Resource expectations are not uniform.\n\nWhoa, then what is?!  If connector semantics are uniform, then\nexpectations must be uniform, no?  I mean, that&#39;s what a connector\nprovides, a contract, a set of expectations.  If the expectations\nare other than what is defined by the connector, then it seems to\nme that the messages must not be self-descriptive.\n\nWhat am I missing?\n\n&gt; For example, consider\n&gt; the server-side image map feature that Kevin Hughes developed.\n&gt; That is an instruction to the client that for URI m, requests\n&gt; of the form m?x,y will be interpreted as points on the graphical\n&gt; plane of the embedded image.  The only change necessary to\n&gt; enable that was a modification to the HTML standard (which was\n&gt; easy to do back then).\n\nHmm, how is the expectation not uniform?  It&#39;s just GET, no?  Server\nside images seem to be just another kind of form.\n\nPerhaps my use of the word &quot;expectation&quot; confused things.\n\nYou also wrote;\n&gt; In short, if you can draw a state machine in which each state is\n&gt; self-described (resident on the client), the transitions from\n&gt; that state are also self-described (instructions for the client\n&gt; to initiate), and each transition is invoked using a self-descriptive\n&gt; message, then you have a RESTful application.  All of the rest\n&gt; of the constraints fall out from the need to be self-descriptive\n&gt; (i.e., generic methods are necessary because resource-specific\n&gt; behavior is too complex to be self-descriptive).\n&gt; \n&gt; Note, however, that it isn&#39;t necessary for all components to understand\n&gt; all of the semantics.  It is only necessary for them to know when they\n&gt; do\n&gt; understand them and also when they do not.  That way, applications can\n&gt; be\n&gt; deployed within the subset of the network that does understand without\n&gt; adversely impacting the components that do not (assuming they are\n&gt; implemented according to the communication standards).\n\nUnderstood, but REST specifically prescribes uniform connector\nsemantics, and to me that means independent of any extension masked\nbehind a mandatory declaration.  Otherwise, as I see it, you&#39;re doing\nservice specific interfaces, just non self-descriptively.  That is,\nit would be more self-descriptive to define and use a new HTTP method\ncalled, say, &quot;PROCESS-AS-QUERY&quot; (with the desired semantics of\nreturning the query results in the response message) for my XQuery\nexample.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
