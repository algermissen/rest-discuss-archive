The ? will reduce\n&gt; your cache effectiveness, and is mighty ugly.  Well, I guess for\n&gt; &quot;give me a list of java articles sorted by title&quot; that is okay,\n&gt; since the articles themselves seem to have permalinks.  Note that\n&gt;\n&gt;    http://www.artima.com/articles/java/index;date;p4\n&gt;\n&gt; is short and says more.  YMMV.\n&gt;\nHow does the question mark reduce cache effectiveness nowadays? I  \nremember reading that some early cache implementations did not cache  \nthe responses of URIs with query parameters, because they considered  \nthat &quot;dynamic content.&quot; But I thought that was old history.\n\nAs far as the URI you suggest, my hope was to allow users to glean  \ninsight into the information architecture of the site by the URI. So / \narticles would be a collection of articles. /articles/ \nwhy_put_and_delete would be an article about PUT and DELETE, etc.  \nAnything under /articles/ needs to be an article, because that helps  \nusers understand the information architecture. So /articles/java  \nmeaning a collection of articles about Java would break the  \nconsistency of that mental model for the user. /articles/java should  \nbe an article about Java.\n\nI also wanted users to be able to chop off pieces of a URI and always  \nstill get something.  /forums/java_answers/1234/9876 would be a forum  \nmessage. They could chop of the last part, yielding /forums/ \njava_answers/1234, which would give them the forum topic containing  \nthat message. Chopping again would yield /forums/java_answers, which  \nwould give them a list of topics in the Java Answers forum. Chopping  \nagain would yield /forums, which would give them a list of forums. I  \nthink it is exactly the Container pattern from Scott&#39;s article,  \nexcept that I don&#39;t support PUT and DELETE.\n\nEach point in the hierarchy is a conceptual thing from the user&#39;s  \nperspective. /forums is a collection of forums. /forums/java_answers  \nis one of those forums, which is a collection of topics. /forums/ \njava_answers/1234 is one of those topics, which is a collection of  \nmessages. And /forums/java_answers/1234/9876 is one of those  \nmessages. At the end of any of these &quot;absolute paths&quot; could be a ?  \nand some parameters that the user can think of as data that will  \nselect a particular &quot;view&quot; of the conceptual thing identified by the  \nabsolute path. I also wanted users to be able to chop off the entire  \nquery portion too, and still get something.\n\nBut I agree ?s and &s and =s are ugly in those URIs. I think I need  \nthe query parameter keys, but in our new architecture, they are  \nalways one character. So instead of:\n\nhttp://www.artima.com/articles?o=a&t=java&p=4\n\nI suppose I could do:\n\nhttp://www.artima.com/articles;oa;tjava;p4\n\nShorter, but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s any less ugly. I&#39;m also not sure it is  \nas obvious to the user that the conceptual thing identified by this  \nURI is http://www.artima.com/articles. Perhaps if there was a  \ndifferent character separating the query parameters, as in:\n\nhttp://www.artima.com/articles;oa,tjava,p4\n\nOr maybe:\n\nhttp://www.artima.com/articles;o=a,t=java,p=4\n\nOr even:\n\nhttp://www.artima.com/articles;otp=a,java,4\n\n&gt;&gt; Currently there is one URI that doesn&#39;t get redirected to the  \n&gt;&gt; canonical form. It&#39;s on my list to fix that:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; http://artima.com/articles?o=a&t=java&p=4\n&gt;\n&gt; Yep, I have the same problem with aliases to gbiv.com.  Unfortunately,\n&gt; my ISP seems to use mod_rewrite&#39;s &quot;final rule&quot; within the virtual host\n&gt; section, so the easy fix doesn&#39;t work for me.\n&gt;\nOne other one that&#39;s on my list to fix is this one:\n\nhttp://www.artima.com/articles?\n\nIt doesn&#39;t currently redirect to get rid of the ?\n\nBill\n\n"}}
