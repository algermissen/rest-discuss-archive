That&#39;s your call, but it might be \n&gt; easier if you said.\n\nYeah, sorry about being vague with the application.  I felt it wasn&#39;t \nimportant to the security discussion, so I didn&#39;t want to create the noise.\n\n&gt; except that within your server application core there MUST be some \n&gt; mapping from\n&gt; URI to object, even if it&#39;s just a hash, or the app has no chance of \n&gt; working.  So your\n&gt; objection is that you can&#39;t push data validation out into the servlet \n&gt; container...\n\nThat mapping you speak of is done by looking at the content.  The \ncontent of the PUT is RDF, and there is a Statement that tells me what \ntype the RDF object is.  I can look at that to determine where to store \nthis object.  The URI unfortunately doesn&#39;t tell me enough information \nto determine (and often infer) the type of the resource.\n\nI&#39;m not objecting to pushing data validation into the servlet container. \n  In fact, I think that&#39;s the only place I can do it.  I was wondering \nif there was an existing framework for the types of security checks I \nneed to it.\n\nHere is an example:\n\nhttp://example.com/car - A car object that people can drive\n\nIn the NON-REST world, if I wanted to drive it, I would do:\n\ncar.drive(start, finish)\n\nBut we all know and love REST, so I would do this in the REST world:\n\ncar.create(new Trip(start, finish))\n\nor even:\n\nserver.create( new Trip(car, start, finish) )\n\nIn other words, I have to create a noun (an object/resource) that \ndescribes the action that I want to take place.  So instead of driving \nthe car via drive(), I have to create (or PUT) a Trip.\n\nIf I&#39;m wrong about the above assumption, please let me know.  That might \nbe the root of my problems. :)\n\nAssuming I need to create a Trip, let&#39;s now talk about security.\n\nPerson A can drive the car from Point P1 to Point P2.\nPerson B can drive the car from Point P1 to Point P3.\n\nSo, Person A can:\n\nserver.create( new Trip(car, P1, P2) )\n\nAnd that should pass.  If Person A tries to:\n\nserver.create( new Trip(car, P1, P3) )\n\nThat should fail.\n\nSo now I&#39;m looking at data validation as a means to control access to \nthe data.  REST is about information, not methods, so it makes sense I \nhave to create a security framework that validates the data.\n\nWhat do the RESTphiles think of the above example?\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; If you use POST to an &#39;object container&#39; URI and let the server assign \n&gt; URIs upon\n&gt; object creation, does that solve that part of the problem?  Note that \n\nThat certainly does make it easier.  I&#39;m currently leaning towards the \ncontainer idea and appending objects to it.  Makes controlling access to \na resource a lot easier.  Still have to do data validation, though, but \nthat&#39;s cool.\n\nSeth\n\r\n--------------ms040208080804070609040705\r\nContent-Type: application/x-pkcs7-signature; name=&quot;smime.p7s&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;smime.p7s&quot;\r\nContent-Description: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--------------ms040208080804070609040705--\r\n\n"}}
