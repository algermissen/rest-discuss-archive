The problem with SOAP/WSDL is that \n&gt; they don&#39;t standardize the things that CAN be standardized, with the \n&gt; most obvious examples being the addressing model and the GET method.\n\nSure.

Any\nnon-processed, aggregate data feed, like typical news & stock quote\nfeeds, is opaque.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.
