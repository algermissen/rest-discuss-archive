Bowman wrote:\n&gt;&gt; I think there are a huge amount of improvements we can make here.\n&gt;&gt; For instance instead of defining URL patterns, URLs can be made more\n&gt;&gt; opaque and instead the spec defines a set of resources, link\n&gt;&gt; relationships, and interactions with those relationships.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Which you seem to understand.  However, without having embarked on this\n&gt; work, you haven&#39;t proven that a RESTful end result is possible.  Clean\n&gt; slate time.  You&#39;ll either come up with a solution based on the REST\n&gt; design pattern, and prove Roy wrong, or you&#39;ll wind up where everyone\n&gt; else has, which is &quot;Huh, Roy&#39;s right.&quot;  But you&#39;re nowhere near enough\n&gt; to boldly claim that problem solved, since you&#39;re defining URI patterns\n&gt; rather than describing what your resources are to begin with.\n&gt; \n\nFYI, I really wasn&#39;t ready to announce today.  Mark mentioned it as a \nbullet point in his keynote.  I mentioned it briefly in my JAX-RS talk. \n  Infoworld had an article today about REST-* and presented it *VERY \nPOORLY*.  Mark felt compelled to respond.  Anne Manes got in the act, \nnow we&#39;ve snowballed into this...\n\nNow I&#39;m forced to play catchup...\n\nHere&#39;s hoping I&#39;m not voted off the island.\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
