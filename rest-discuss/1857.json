I&#39;m not sure the\n&gt; &gt; &#39;head&#39; approach will work.\n&gt;\n&gt;Actually, this is a good problem to explore, because I it gives me a \n&gt;strong urge\n&gt;to model the solution with verbs.  It&#39;s most certainly not a good idea to\n&gt;transfer a representation of the entire queue, modify it, and transfer it \n&gt;back.\n&gt;There must be a protocol for queue interaction that is RESTful.  How about \n&gt;this\n&gt;approach:\n&gt;\n&gt;1. A &#39;POST /myqueue&#39; to enqueue a message representation.  The entity\n&gt;    is treated as a subordinate to the &#39;/myqueue&#39; queue resource.\n&gt;2. A &#39;DELETE /myqueue/head&#39; to dequeue a representation of the first\n&gt;    message in the queue.  The entity returned is a representation\n&gt;    of the removed message.\n\nThe only problem with this is that DELETE is supposed to be idempotent . -\nfrom RFC2612 &quot;in that (aside from error or expiration issues) the\nside-effects of N &gt; 0 identical requests is the same as for a single request&quot;\nand &quot;Methods can also have the property of &quot;idempotence&quot; in that (aside from\nerror or expiration issues) the side-effects of N &gt; 0 identical requests is\nthe same as for a single request. The methods GET, HEAD,PUT and DELETE share\nthis property.&quot;\n\nI think I am leaning towards Mike&#39;s original suggestion - 3 remove message\nfrom queue with DELETE.\n\n\nRobert\n\n\n"}}
