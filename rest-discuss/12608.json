I think HATEOAS precludes hard-coding application \nspecific intelligence on the client. I&#39;m not sure if it is reconcilable \nwith shipping rules or other metadata to the client. And I have no good \nidea how to map to resources some of the things I&#39;d need to find out \nfrom the server.\n\nA case in point from a movie database (my running example for pestering \nvarious mailing lists): There are movies and their associated \nparticipants, there are unaffiliated people, and there are awards. \nEveryone&#39;s supreme goal is to receive an award. So the user tries to \nhelp, grabs an award and starts to drag it around. But where to drop it? \nThere are all kinds of potential targets around, but on closer scrutiny \n(requiring intelligence) only some of them fit. You just can&#39;t honor an \nactor with a Best Picture Oscar. And, after all, the award may already \nhave been given to some other person/movie for the relevant year.\n\nIn other words, which one of the, say, 100 potential drop targets are \nreally eligible, is a highly dynamic decision best left to the server. \nSo, given a list of candidate drop targets, how do I RESTfully ask the \nserver to filter them and return only the real contenders?\n\nThere are two additional constraints I can immediately think of. There \nare too many candidates to comfortably stuff into the query string of a \nGET request. Having to ask the server at all is too bad, performance-\nwise, but unavoidable (AFAICT). Several trips, e.g. for POSTing a new \nresource and then GETting the needed information from it in another \nrequest, is probably too much traffic.\n\nI&#39;m very curious to read your suggestions.\n\nMichael\n\n-- \nMichael Schuerig\nmailto:michael@...\nhttp://www.schuerig.de/michael/\n\n\n"}}
