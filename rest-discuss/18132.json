First my assumption:\nPeople don&#39;t get REST, bec=\r\nause one of the main ideas is that you need common\nstandard media types for=\r\n REST. But people don&#39;t know about media types.\nI&#39;ve done web sites for 6 y=\r\nears but only now, while doing research for my\nbachelor thesis, I discovere=\r\nd how many great media types are there and could\nbe reused.\n\nAnd there is n=\r\no advertisement for good media types. Where can I go and browse\n/ search / =\r\nfilter a list of media types and look whether there is already\nsomething re=\r\ngistered for my need?\n\nRegards,\n\nThomas Koch, http://www.koch.ro\n\n\n--------=\r\n----------------------------\n\nYahoo!
