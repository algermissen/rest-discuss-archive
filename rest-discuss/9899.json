the user is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; across multiple requests (application state, which is A-OK as long as it\n&gt; &gt;&gt; lives on & is controlled by the client) so it can fire XHRs which are\n&gt; &gt;&gt; asking for THIS user&#39;s data.  The two choices are a cookie (which I contend\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is not unRESTful if used in this way) OR always including the user-id in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the page URL so that the server can encode that user-id in the hypertext\n&gt; &gt;&gt; which the client can then use to get more (personalized) data.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If the client is building the page/resource, then the client should be\n&gt; &gt; assigning and managing URIs for those resources. The server does not need to\n&gt; &gt; know about these URIs, but that doesn&#39;t mean no one needs to know about them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Agreed to the extent that the client needs to manage those compound\n&gt; objects (i.e. new resources), but needing to assign them a URI, I&#39;m not\n&gt; convinced. I think we&#39;re beyond the edge of finding benefit in REST\n&gt; constraints.  E.g., if I print out a bunch of articles from xml.com &\n&gt; staple them together I have created a new resource. But there may or may\n&gt; not be any advantage to assigning that resource a URI.  To suggest it is a\n&gt; bad idea for me to create that compound object because I have no intention\n&gt; of giving it a URI is where I see the problem.  The browser can manage\n&gt; those resources any way it wishes and my contention is that cookies & XHR\n&gt; are the best tools we have right now to do that, and by effectively\n&gt; separating out that concern from the server opens up a world of\n&gt; possibilities/opportunities.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; It is a fundamental principle of REST that resources are identified by URIs\n&gt; &gt; and not by some combination of URI and some non-URI identifier like a cookie.\n&gt; &gt; The URI alone should be sufficient. There are very good reasons for this\n&gt; &gt; principle.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Agreed, but that&#39;s not what I am talking about here.  In no case is there\n&gt; a &quot;shared secret&quot; communicated by way of a cookie.  The cookie is used\n&gt; ONLY to construct a new url to access another resource. Whether I use a\n&gt; cookie or or some other mechanism is irrelevant.  Perhaps &quot;cookie&quot; is now\n&gt; so loaded w/ bad connotations (and a history of misuse) that one dare not\n&gt; go there.  Firefox now allows you to &quot;bookmark&quot; a set of open tabs.  I see\n&gt; no reason not to offer that capability simply because it violates a REST\n&gt; constraint.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; You seem to be getting hung up on a not-hugely relevant distinction between\n&gt; &gt; client and server, In the scenario you describe, the browser is in effect\n&gt; &gt; running a server, maybe not an HTTP server but a potentially RESTful server\n&gt; &gt; nonetheless. To REST, a server is simply that which receives URIs and returns\n&gt; &gt; representations.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, agreed wholeheartedly and that&#39;s exactly where I am going with this.\n&gt; The browser will become increasingly more like a server (interesting that\n&gt; Roy F&#39;s latest talk &quot;A Little REST and Relaxation&quot; hints at a relaxation\n&gt; of the client/server constraint to be a useful experiment).  I&#39;ve been\n&gt; playing with the Firefox &quot;POW&quot; (plain old web server) plugin for image\n&gt; uploading to great effect (I don&#39;t &quot;send&quot; images to the server, rather I\n&gt; point to a local directory and let the server grab &#39;em).\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Different URIs are served to the browser from different servers, one of which\n&gt; &gt; is the browser itself; but this does not change the fundamental principle\n&gt; &gt; that different resources should have different URIs.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; But assigned by whom?  The server or the browser-as-server?  I see this as\n&gt; a separation-of-concerns issue.  Building a restful web service need not\n&gt; require me (the guy developing the service on the server side) to worry\n&gt; about those URIs that might need to be assigned to new combinations of my\n&gt; resources -- that&#39;s a task for the &quot;application&quot; that lives on the client\n&gt; and is going to use my service. (note that in my original example the\n&gt; client-side &quot;application&quot; is the javascript that manages the cookies and\n&gt; fires off the XHRs).\n&gt;\n&gt; Ultimately, I feel like there is a great opportunity to create really\n&gt; useful and simple web services by offloading some of the organizing the\n&gt; creation of new compound objects onto the client, and that we have the\n&gt; tools -- not ideal, perhaps -- in cookies, javascript & XHR, to do just\n&gt; that.\n&gt;\n&gt; -peter\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\n&gt; &gt; Java I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\n&gt; &gt; http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\n&gt; &gt; http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
