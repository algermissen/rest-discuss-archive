(The w3c archives are to the spec as the\n&gt; Federalist Papers are to the Constitution, but probably a lot\n&gt; of significant discussion isn&#39;t publically available)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; How about evaluating these approaches against a specific, theoretical\n&gt; scenario?\n&gt;\n&gt; Are talking about evaluating the mechanisms for binding the metadata  \n&gt; or for\n&gt; what that\n&gt; metadata would look like?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
