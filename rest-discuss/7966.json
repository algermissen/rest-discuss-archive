Their opinions are interesting, but real\n&gt; independent deployed apps would be even more interesting.\n\nI have no financial affilations to them at all. They just happen to be\nfriends of mine who host my blog. The original netkernel was an\nex-HPLabs project, which got killed for various reasons; the NetKernel\nteam got to take the idea, all the IP and the code; what you get now\nis a complete rewrite.\n\n\nWriting something serious with NK is still on my very-long todo list;\nwhat it can do is bridge a database to the net without going through\nthe Java EE layer, which makes sense. Why do an R/O then an O/X\nmapping, when you can go straight from R to X? I think the big barrier\nto me sitting down and doing so is the usual one: time. I always get\nthe feeling that NK works best if you understand the X-* spec world,\nXPath, XSL, XForms, etc. and frankly, my knowledge of all of these is\npatchy to say the least. The part of my brain that can cope with\nspecifications has been filled up with WS-* and the Java EE specs, and\nI need to slowly let those facts decay before I can fill them with\nmore useful things.\n\nAt the same time, I think its one of interesting ways of viewing and\nworking with data. It and yahoo pipes could connect together in\ninteresting ways. It&#39;s certainly made a bigger jump than say, Ruby\nhas, or rest annotations for Java. But revolutions are often harder to\ntake up than evolution.\n\nIf/when I play with it more I will describe it without too much bias.\nBut this week&#39;s spare time is being spent learning the R language to\ndo analysis of six months worth of passers by bluetooth data.\n\n-steve\n\n"}}
