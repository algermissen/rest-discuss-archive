A POST request transfers an \n&gt;&gt;&gt;entity to the server.  I don&#39;t see any reason not to consider that \n&gt;&gt;&gt;entity a representation of some (perhaps unnamed) resource. In fact, in \n&gt;&gt;&gt;some cases, the representation that is transferred will be GETable as a \n&gt;&gt;&gt;named resource once it is submitted to the server.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Exactly.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;If the data being transferred cannot be described as a representation of\n&gt;&gt;some (perhaps unnamed) resource, then you&#39;re not doing it right.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Hmm ...\n&gt;\n&gt;On Sun, Sep 08, 2002 at 10:18:23PM -0400, Seairth Jacobs wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I see nothing here saying that the request entity is a representation.  All\n&gt;&gt;that I see is a request entity that may replace or create a new resource\n&gt;&gt;identified by the request-URI.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;This has always bothered me too. Unless I misunderstand the concept of\n&gt;&#39;representation&#39; (which is perfectly possible--I haven&#39;t gotten around\n&gt;to reading Fielding&#39;s dissertation or other deep scholarly work on\n&gt;REST), the ability to PUT or POST a representation raises a serious\n&gt;issue which I have not seen addressed on this list.\n&gt;\n&gt;What if a client PUTs a representation of a type that is impractical to\n&gt;transform to the type of the existing resource? Doesn&#39;t that effectively\n&gt;cripple the resource, upsetting the expectations of other clients?\n&gt;\nThe server is free to reject the PUT request with something like:\n    406 Not Acceptable\n    409 Conflict\n    415 Unsupported Media Type\n\nAlso, some readings of 2616 woud say that on a PUT, there&#39;s no \ntransforming a representation to the existing resource type.   You&#39;re \njust storing the representation as is.\n\n&gt; For\n&gt;example, suppose your resource is an SVG graphic--one of the most\n&gt;information-rich image formats, and one that can be transformed to any\n&gt;output format (known in this context as a representation, right?) you\n&gt;like. So your server might make available JPEG, PNG, and EPS\n&gt;representations of the image. Outbound, there&#39;s no problem. But now\n&gt;suppose somebody wants to PUT a JPEG to the URI? If you allow the put,\n&gt;then your information-rich SVG image is now degraded to a dumb JPEG (I&#39;m\n&gt;talking about what happens in the real world, not the MIT Media Lab),\n&gt;which not only contains less information than the old resource, but may\n&gt;be impractical to transform to some of the representation types that are\n&gt;supposed to be available.\n&gt;\n\nDepending on the definition of the resource, it may be perfectly \nreasonable to accept a JPEG as &#39;input&#39; and transform it to PNG.  Yes, \nthis may result in some degradation of information, but in this case the \nowner of the resource has decided that that&#39;s OK.  Of course the \nresource may be defined in such a way that only requests in PNG format \nare accepted.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;So do you disallow certain types of representations from being PUT or \n&gt;POSTed? That certainly seems like a practical response to the problem.\n&gt;But I would think that in a very large proportion of cases, you&#39;d have\n&gt;to prohibit any type but the original type of the resource--in which\n&gt;case the distinction between resource and representation seems rather\n&gt;academic.\n&gt;\nDont confuse a resource with the entity that backs the resource.  A \nresource is a logical construct - a concept.  A resource may be backed \nby a document, and the bytes that comprise that document may correspond \nexactly to the representation of the resource, but the resource and the \nrepresentation are never the same thing.\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n\n\n"}}
