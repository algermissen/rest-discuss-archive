He talked me through it and the gist was that he\n&gt; could use (something like) XMPP for events AND polling. That way the\n&gt; loss of an event isn&#39;t disastrous, and HTTP does all the heavy lifting.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t know if this is applicable to your domain, but it was a neat\n&gt; solution that really appealed to me.\n\nIf you&#39;re on J2ME and the event rate isn&#39;t frantic, push registry is an \noption.\n\nhttp://developers.sun.com/mobility/midp/articles/pushreg/\n\nBill\n\n"}}
