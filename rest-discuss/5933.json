If so, then \n&gt;  &gt;&gt; the\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; server can remember whether that URI had been posted to before.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; That&#39;s it. The reason to have the POE header is to let the client\n&gt;  &gt; interpret the 2xx and 405 responses. But what&#39;s really nice about this\n&gt;  &gt; ID is that it degrades gracefully - a POE unaware client can function\n&gt;  &gt; with a POE aware server and the exactly once semantics can still be\n&gt;  &gt; obtained.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; That makes sense. The /12345 is like a deja vu token in a way, but \n&gt; embedded in the post URL instead of being put in a post parameter \n&gt; (such as from a hidden form field), as far as I can see. For users \n&gt; posting forms from web pages, I think it has the same issue of if \n&gt; they back up and actually change the submission, and post again, the \n&gt; server won&#39;t let them. In that case it is not really a duplicate \n&gt; post, even though the deja vu token is still /12345, because the data \n&gt; is different. I think this is a common use case. When I search for \n&gt; flights at united.com, for example, I like to back up from one \n&gt; result, modify the form, and resubmit, to get a new result. It saves \n&gt; me time by not having to enter everything into a blank form, but just \n&gt; change the previously used one. Oh, I guess what I&#39;d do there is just \n&gt; not make that post URL a POE one. I would just use POEs for posts \n&gt; like credit card charges that really need to be idempotent.\n\nIt&#39;s worth pointing out that the /12345 is entirely private to the \nserver, all the client deals with is the URL. And I think creating a new \nresource to represent state this way is much cleaner that redirect after \nPOST hacks via controllers (an idiom that seems to be common in the Java \nworld).\n\n&gt; What do you mean by &quot;incorporate 410 to emulate ttl?&quot;\n\nI mean that for this to work you need to keep a record of URLs that \ncould be POSTed to and might be rePOSTed to. Servers need to be able to \nrelease those resources heuristically as there&#39;s no guarantee the client \nwill come back. It&#39;s nicer if they have a means of letting the client \nknow what&#39;s happened.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
