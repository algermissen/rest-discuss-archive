A client \ninteracts\n&gt; with a service and in so doing the service may create new resources.\n&gt; They may be short or long-lived. Is there, in general, a \nrequirement to\n&gt; reify this as a &quot;session&quot;? Opinions requested.\n\nNo.  I wish I had not framed the question that way.\nIn fact, the reason I asked it was because you hinted in some \nprevious messages that the resources created by interactions would \neliminate the need to reify and keep track of &quot;sessions&quot;.\n\nTo the extent that the idea holds up, it could also eliminate all \nkinds of crufty buggy baggage.\n\n&gt; One reason that I resist this is because I would like for it to be\n&gt; possible to construct a single logical client from many \ndifferent &quot;HTTP\n&gt; clients&quot;. i.e. for me to dispatch part of the job to a totally \ndifferent\n&gt; software component merely by sending it a URI. &quot;Tax form \nverification\n&gt; code service, please check my tax form before I send it. It is at\n&gt; http:///&quot;. This gets much more complicated if the client and server \nhave\n&gt; a shared, implicit notion of where we are in the multi-step process.\n\nUnfortunately, business exchanges require trading partners to agree \non states, but they could be states of resources, not processes.\n(Or to put it another way, the states of a business process can be \nmodeled as states of resources.)  For example, trading partners need \nto know if an order has been accepted, rejected, fulfilled, etc. but \nthose are states of the order, and both the order and its state(s) \ncould be Web resources.\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\nP.S. Paul, I could search for the hints in previous messages if you \nwant me to, but maybe you remember them?  I didn&#39;t bookmark any of \nthem, unfortunately - a lightbulb went on when I was reading the Wiki \npage and thinking you had the seed of a better way.\n\n\n"}}
