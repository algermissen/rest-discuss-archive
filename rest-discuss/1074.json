What constraints do you have?\n&gt;Bringing up the problem domain may result in someone with experience with\n&gt;event systems and another with HTTP/REST and we may get some collaboration\n&gt;going.\n\nFor the sake of discussion and to (eventually) serve as a well understood example of REST in action, assume I am implementing a fully REST-ified, event-driven version of the ticket order example described in Appendix D of the Web Services Flow Language document (http://www-4.ibm.com/software/solutions/webservices/pdf/WSFL.pdf).\n\n From this document:\n\n&quot;The overall flow of this example is as follows: A traveler will plan her trip by specifying the various stages of his overall journey and all of its participants. For each of the stages, the traveler specifies the location that she wants to visit as well as the date when she wants to begin and the date when she wants to end the particular stay. When the traveler is finished with this, she sends this information together with the list of all participants of the trip as well as the information about the credit card to be charged for the ordered tickets to the travel agent. The credit card information has been passed when the business process was instantiated. Next, the traveler will await the submission of the electronic tickets as well as the final itinerary for the trip. When the agent receives the travelerï¿½s trip order, he will determine the legs for each of the stages, which includes an initial seat reservation for each of the participants as well as the rate chosen. To actuall\ny make the corresponding ticket orders the agent submits these legs together with the information about the credit card to be charged to the airline company. Then, the agent will wait for the confirmation of the flights, which especially includes the actual seats reserved for each of the participants. This information is completed into an itinerary, which is then sent to the traveler.\n\nWhen the airline receives the ticket order submitted by the agent, the requested seats will be checked and if available assigned to the corresponding participants. After that, the credit card will be charged, and the updated leg information is sent back to the agent as confirmation of the flights. After that, the airline sends the electronic tickets by e-mail to the traveler. Information about the recipient of the tickets has been specified by the traveler when instantiating the trip order process and this information is passed to the agent as well as to the airline.&quot;\n\nIn order to focus on the event notification issues, assume that the rest of the system is implemented using REST (we might return to this later). The points of interest are as follows \n    1. Trip information to the travel agent\n    2. Ticket orders to the airline(s)\n    3. Confirmation from the airline(s) to the agent\n    4. Itinerary from agent to the traveller\n    5. e-tickets from airline(s) to the traveller and notification to agent\n\nSome other requirements may include a monitoring service that registers an interest in all the points above to make sure things are happening in a timely manner, an auditing service and an operations management reporting service for the agents.\n\nSo the events of interest may be :\n   Trip request received\n   Trip created\n   Ticket order required\n   Ticket ordered\n   Ticket confirmed\n   Itinerary creation required\n   Itinerary created\n   Itinerary delivery required\n   Itinerary delivered\n  E-ticket received\n   Trip completed\n\nHow is this for a starting point?\n\nRobert\n\n\n"}}
