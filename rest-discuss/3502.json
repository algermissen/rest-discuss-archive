One module is generated for\n    each state in the FSM.  Each generated module contains a class\n    that implements the state.\n\n  - An __init__.py file -- This file implements the dispatcher for\n    the application.  It takes the current state name and calls the\n    implementation of that state.\n\n  - A states.py file -- This file contains a super class for the\n    classes that implement the states in the FSM.\n\n  - XML Schema files -- One file is generated for each state in the\n    FSM.  And, these XML Schema files are used to generate a python\n    parser for each XML interchange document and Python classes\n    that represent the XML elements in each document.\n\n  - A GUI definition file -- An XML definition file for a graphical\n    user interface.  The interface definition can be edited with\n    wxGlade graphical GUI editor.  wxGlade can also generate Python\n    code that implements the user interface.  This code can be used\n    in the implementation of client applications.  wxGlade\n    generates Python code for wxPython.\n\nI&#39;ve picked FSM to work with because I feel that we need a\nsystematic way to work with and implement complex processes in a\nREST-ful way.\n\nThis is not finished code or a shrink-wrap,\nuse-it-right-out-of-the-box product.  I view it more as code to\nbuild upon.  And, the code that it generates requires editing: for\nexample, you will want to add application specific functionality. \nHowever, my tests show that it generates a reasonable skeleton of\nan application.\n\nA document describing this is available at:\n\n    http://www.rexx.com/~dkuhlman/fsmGenerate_howto.html\n\nAnd, a file containing support code and examples is at:\n\n    http://www.rexx.com/~dkuhlman/fsmGenerate_examples.zip.\n\nAs usual, I am interested in comments and suggestions.  And, if you\nwould like help using this, please let me know.\n\n  - Dave\n\n-- \nDave Kuhlman\ndkuhlman@...\nhttp://www.rexx.com/~dkuhlman\n\n\n"}}
