Roy&#39;s thesis has=\r\n this to say in section 3.5.3:\n&quot;In the code-on-demand style [50], a client =\r\ncomponent has access to a set of resources, but not the know-how on how to =\r\nprocess them. It sends a request to a remote server for the code representi=\r\nng that know-how, receives that code, and executes it locally.&quot;\n\nNow, apple=\r\nts and in-page javascript fit this bill. They are an important way in which=\r\n the client supports customization by the server as it navigates from one s=\r\ntate to the next. However, I have seen plugins also claimed as being code o=\r\nn demand. My argument for them not being so is that the user explicitly dow=\r\nnloads and &quot;deploys&quot; a plugin before it is useful. I guess my basic argumen=\r\nt is that if it has an installed presence within the client outside of the =\r\napplication state when the client is at rest then it has stepped outside of=\r\n code-on-demand and into a manual deployment model. However, I thought I wo=\r\nuld throw the question out to a wider audience:\n\nDoes the manual installati=\r\non step of installing a plugin prevent it from being code-on-demand? Does a=\r\n requirement to restart the browser prevent it from being code-on-demand? W=\r\nould a requirement to download a thick client and use that for further acce=\r\nss to the site still be an example of code-on-demand? Is it just software t=\r\nhat depends on the real machine instead of a common virtual machine across =\r\nthe clients that is stepping outside of code on demand? Where do the bounda=\r\nries of this constraint lie?\n\nBenjamin.\n\n\n"}}
