The technique we end up using will come from some\n&gt; &gt; effort like microformats. It probably won&#39;t have a ton to do with OWL.\n&gt; &gt; Some people will just tag elements in forms and declare what\n&gt; &gt; &quot;author-name&quot; means, and off we go.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sure, for specific problem areas or needs.  ATOM/RSS did just that for blog\n&gt; publishing and aggregation for the most part, at least at some conceptual\n&gt; level.\n\nAgreed. You could extend the APP work to define how to tag form elements.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; My comment was more about overall semantics, that are not tied to a\n&gt; particular application or solution segment.  Where any arbitrary server and\n&gt; client could just decide to communicate and have it happen automagically. I\n&gt; just don&#39;t see that happening any time soon.\n&gt;\n\nI don&#39;t think it will happen in a big bang either. It will happen in\nparticular solution segments first. Then there will be some bleedover.\nThen certain winners will emerge from the tagwars.\n\nHugh\n\n"}}
