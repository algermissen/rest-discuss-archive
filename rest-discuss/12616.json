If you&#39;re writing an \nAJAX application, you&#39;re still getting &quot;application specific \nintelligence&quot; from the server downloaded as Javascript.  Unless you&#39;re \nwriting a pure HTML based application, which it seems your not, you&#39;re \ngonna break this *mythical* constraint.  As I keep saying over and over, \nmachine-based clients usually have to have application specific \nintelligence to actually work.  Unless you&#39;re one of the &lt; 1% \napplications that are generic enough to interpret things on the fly.\n\nFWIW, back in the mid-90s we had *much* richer UIs through VB, VC++, and \nPowerbuilder (and we were much much more productive).  We had much more \nstateless services.  What the web gave everybody was a standard \ndistribution mechanism.  Companies liked these rich UIs but they didn&#39;t \nlike installing and upgrading them on 100s of callcenter computers.\n\nThis may sound like I&#39;m attacking REST, but I&#39;m not.  I&#39;m just pointing \nout that religious design decisions will probably hurt you in the short \nand long run.\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
