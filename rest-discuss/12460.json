It can be used on its own or alongside other\n&gt; Rack-based applications or middleware components such as Rails, Merb or\n&gt; Sinatra.\n&gt;\n&gt; The API looks interesting. For example:\n&gt;\n&gt; OPTIONS /%uri%\n&gt;\n&gt; Return an Allow header containing the available methods for a given URI.\n\nCloudKit does address an interesting problem, but OPTIONS is an\nHTTP/1.1 thing, and should be supported by whatever library you&#39;re\nusing for REST development.  That&#39;s certainly the case with any of the\n(Java-based) JAX-RS implementations, which are required to synthesize\nan appropriate response to an OPTIONS request (based on what resources\nmethods you&#39;ve provided for the various HTTP verbs), unless you have\nprovided a custom resource method to handle it.\n\nCraig\n\n"}}
