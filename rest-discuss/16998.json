I read the entire thread. I get it now about\n&gt; media-type.. at least for the most part. I am still not sure if I\n&gt; should create a single media-type for our particular application or\n&gt; not.. or how you determine if you should or not. Partly, the\n&gt; confusion lies with the number of posts I&#39;ve seen about &quot;you should\n&gt; register your media-types with IANA to help build it up&quot;. \n&gt; \n\nI&#39;ve been doing REST development for a dozen years, and have yet to\ncreate a media type.  If you _must_ create a media type, you _must_\nregister it.  But that&#39;s a pretty big &quot;if&quot;.  Consider the multitude of\napplications on the real-world Web using text/html -- it is _not_\nrequired for each application, be it banking or travel reservations or\ne-mail or shopping, to have its own media type.  Re-using ubiquitous\ntypes has the benefit of scaling out-of-the-box; creating your own,\neven if it&#39;s registered, will only achieve Internet scale if it becomes\nubiquitous -- another pretty big &quot;if&quot;.  My advice on creating your own\nmedia types remains unchanged -- don&#39;t.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
