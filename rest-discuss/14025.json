Make sure you look at the\nparameters extension - that should provide you with the descriotive part\nof your service. The parameters extension supports POST and the  \nsubmission\nof application/x-www-form-urlencoded query data. You;d have to translate\nyour query document into parameters I think. OTH, maybe OpenSearch also\nsupports submission of other media types - have a look.\n\n\n\n&gt; I was thinking of PUTting the query document (say to /documents/query)\n&gt; and reading back the result response.\n\nNo, PUT is wrong. POST would by the right method. PUT means &#39;replace\nstate of resource with what I send you&#39; and this is not what you want.\n\n&gt; Is it a proper choice to use PUT for executing a query operation?\n\nNo, PUT for a query is not correct. The best is GET and the use of\nquery parameters in the URI but if you have to submit very complex\nstuff or if a result resource is created on the server then POST\nis the way to go.\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n&gt; Any thoughts?\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in advance,\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;\n&gt; Sergio B.\n&gt;\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Sergio Bossa\n&gt; Software Passionate and Open Source Enthusiast.\n&gt; URL: http://www.linkedin.com/in/sergiob\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
