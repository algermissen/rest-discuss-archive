We leverage Spri=\r\nng MVC facilities to be able to design the server side to answer DELETE req=\r\nuest for resources.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now as we server HTML in the default case, it&#39;s a r=\r\nequirement to present a web page to explicitly confirm the deletion of the =\r\nresource. Wearing the REST glasses I wonder how to handle this requirement?=\r\n I see two options:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. Exposing the confirmation request as separate re=\r\nsource reachable via GET, that returns a HTML representation including the =\r\nform to trigger the actually intended DELETE request via HTML form quirks.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. Append a request parameter (e.g. ?confirm=3Dtrue) to the DELETE requ=\r\nest to indicate there are &quot;options&quot; on the request method (in my case true =\r\nwould return the HTML representation of the confirmation page).\n&gt;\n&gt; From a =\r\nsimple like/dislike standpoint I&#39;d prefer the second option as I do not hav=\r\ne to introduce a somewhat artificial additional resource. Nevertheless I do=\r\n not feel weel with 2, as it clearly weakens the contract that comes with D=\r\nELETE.\n&gt;\n&gt; Any ideas, opinions, thaughts?\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Ollie\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ----=\r\n--------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
