There is\n&gt; this idea that if we PUT a resource through its URI, then we GET\n&gt; that resource back, we should get back the same value as we PUT.\n&gt; That statement implies that we have representation-level control,\n&gt; which we do not.  It would make more sense to think of it this\n&gt; way.  If we PUT a representation to a URI, then GET back a representation,\n&gt; the latter representation *means the same thing* as the former,\n&gt; though it may differ in format or even typographically.  THoughts?\n\nActually, PUT&#39;s a bit funny that way.  It&#39;s definined to really mean\n&quot;store&quot; more than &quot;set the state&quot;, so it is expected that bits are\npreserved.  For this reason, SOAP can&#39;t use PUT (at least how you&#39;d\nexpect it to be used).\n\nAt some point, I&#39;m going to propose a &quot;SET&quot; method that can be used\nin this way.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
