IMHO,\n&gt; &gt; abstract concepts are not within the realm of distributed systems but\n&gt; &gt; are\n&gt; &gt; subject to knowledge representation/information management (in other\n&gt; &gt; words:\n&gt; &gt; subject to possible applications of the architectural style, but not\n&gt; &gt; part\n&gt; &gt; of the architecture itself).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Can anyone explain to me, why REST actually re-defines &#39;resource&#39; to\n&gt; &gt; include\n&gt; &gt; c) ?\n&gt; \n&gt; Every thing (two words 8-) is a resource.  c) is automatically included\n&gt; by this definition, and to remove it would be arbitrary, and would\n&gt; lessen the power of the Web.\n\nI understand, though that does not really satisfy me....but that is\nanother\ntopic for another day ;-)\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The second question I have is related to the question what the\n&gt; &gt; semantics of a resource are.  Roy&#39;s dissertation says:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;REST accomplishes this by defining a resource to be the\n&gt; &gt;  semantics of what the author intends to identify, rather\n&gt; &gt;  than the value corresponding to those semantics at the\n&gt; &gt;  time the reference is created.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To me this seems to contradict the idea of authorities defining the\n&gt; &gt; semantics of resources.\n&gt; \n&gt; No, it&#39;s just that the document returned via GET doesn&#39;t have to be\n&gt; 100% unambiguous about what the URI identifies (and I suggest that it\n&gt; couldn&#39;t be if it wanted to, but that&#39;s another topic for another day\n&gt; 8-).\n&gt; \n[...]\n&gt; Any use of the URI can contribute to its meaning.  Using the clock\n&gt; example, if a bunch of people used that URI to identify &quot;the current\n&gt; time&quot;, and then my clock breaks and I decide not to fix it (I&#39;m using\n&gt; it to identify &quot;that particular clock&quot;), then there is, in effect, an\n&gt; expectation on me to change what it identifies to what most people\n&gt; think it identifies.  It&#39;s up to me whether or not I want to do that,\n&gt; of course.\n\nAh, interesting. This focusses on the collaborative aspect of the Web\nand kind of makes it possible for the Semantic Web to grow while\nstill being &quot;on the Web&quot;. Did I get that right?\n\nOTH: is that documented somewhere? Why is there an ongoing\ndebate within RDF/SW about what certain URIs denote and what not?\n(e.g. fragment-identifier-URIs pointing to Web pages etc.)\n\nIOW: Is it *your* explanation/position? REST&#39;s position?  Is the\nRDF/SW community aware of this view at all?\n\nJan\n\nP.S.
