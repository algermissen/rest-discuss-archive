I&#39;m thinking about a primitive operation that \n&gt; supports readers.\n&gt; \n&gt; One writer alone could drive hundreds of readers. Just to pick an\n&gt; example: one writer pushes positive integers and many readers \n&gt; check for prime numbers. Not a very useful example on it&#39;s \n&gt; own, but that single writer could drive many, many readers.\n&gt; \n&gt; This thread (and the reliable messaging proposals for REST) \n&gt; have addressed many issues (like network failures. Perhaps \n&gt; ordered messaging isn&#39;t covered already.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t know if a single generalized primitive operation is \n&gt; good enough to address this issue. This seems like a more \n&gt; variable problem than &quot;many writers&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; One of the things I&#39;ve been thinging about is how to \n&gt; re-implement the EIP patterns in RESTful systems, like \n&gt; Competing Consumers \n&gt; http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/CompetingConsumers.html\n&gt; \n&gt; This seems like a tough problem without another method. I \n&gt; haven&#39;t found a really good example of what to base that on \n&gt; though. Reading the GFS paper I realized that the append \n&gt; operation on GFS files supports many writers, but GFS doesn&#39;t \n&gt; have an operation for many readers.\n&gt; \n&gt; John Heintz\n&gt; \n&gt; On 6/13/07, Mike Dierken &lt;dierken@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Outside of MOM I don&#39;t know of any generalized support \n&gt; for many readers.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You mean, many readers (of a single resource/message) but only one \n&gt; &gt; consumer/processor of that one resource?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; John D.
