So throw out the old ways of doing\nthings and think about what you are actually talking about. What are you\ndoing with a 2pc? That&#39;s technical. What are you actually doing? You are\ntrying to take several actions at the same time, right? Do they *really* need\nto happen at the same time? Or can interim steps occur with a final POST/PUT\nto a new resource with your desired end result? That&#39;s quite possibly the\nsame end goal with much richer semantics.\n\nAs to the idea of a message queue being only a non-REST architectural\npattern, I don&#39;t quite follow. (Of course, I&#39;m still new to most of this so\nI would generally just nod and accept.) What is Atom if not an excellent\nmedium for providing a message queue? Why not POST/PUT the intermediary\nresources, display their state via Atom feeds and, once everything is\npublished, take your final action to the final state? You now have a\ntransaction-ish process using fully RESTful *and* meaningful semantics with\nfull audit support.\n\nI like the example of buying a book or books in an online bookstore. I can\nadd books (PotentialOrderItem) to my shopping cart (PotentialOrder), decide\nto buy some of them (PendingOrder + PendingOrderItems), and then add\nadditional books later (PotentialOrderItem -&gt; PendingOrderItem) before my\norder is processed (ProcessedOrder + ProcessedOrderItems). Once I submit my\npayment info (PaymentRequest) and that has been approved (PaymentReceived)\nand the warehouse acknowledges everything is ready (PendingOrderPrepared), I\ncould then know that my order (Order) would be completed and no further\nactions may be processed against it except such things as shipping\nnotifications, returns, etc. My types (in parentheses) are quite clear, my\nstate transitions are clear, and I can wait to take a final action once I\nknow everything is in that needs to be. (Sorry if that is completely trivial\nto all of you, but that&#39;s the kind of thing I have been tossing about inside\nmy head of late.)\n\nRyan Riley\n\n&gt;\n\r\n--000325554c7e17f2870473ba4af1\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Wed, Sep 16, 2009 at 6:04 PM, Bill Burke &lt;spa=\r\nn dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:bburke@...&quot;&gt;bburke@...&lt;/a=\r\n&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;margin:0 =\r\n0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div cla=\r\nss=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;But, this idea that everything has to be handcrafted is=\r\nn&#39;t right either.=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;The right solution is somewhere in the middl=\r\ne (hence middleware).=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;This is why I like REST better than the way =\r\nCORBA and WS-* has gone=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\nabout describing things.
