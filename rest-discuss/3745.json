Someone asked a question \nabout it and we answered it!\n\n&gt; ...\n&gt; I can also link to a printable version of my\n&gt; unbilled transactions:\n&gt; \n&gt;   https://www.accountonline.com/UnbilledTrans?PRINT_VERSION=Y\n&gt; \n&gt; Both printable versions are simply current records\n&gt; of my account state without any links/buttons to\n&gt; make changes.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d like to be able to provide third parties\n&gt; (e.g. my accountant) with access to these pages,\n&gt; but I can&#39;t without providing them with control\n&gt; over my entire account.\n&gt; \n&gt; The questions are:\n&gt; 1. Is this system RESTful?\n&gt; 2. Would it be RESTful if it used HTTP-auth rather than cookie auth?\n\n1. Yes, it is RESTful, but it is lacking a feature that would be useful \nto you. It would be easy to extend the system with the feature you ask \nfor. There could be a button that says: &quot;universal link&quot;.\n\nConversely, if there was _only_ the universal link then your accountant \ncould not send you a URI and say: &quot;Click this to see your unbilled \ntransactions.&quot;\n\nBut it is hard to imagine how this would work from a UI point of view. \nThere are serious security implications. Would a typical user understand \nhow to give someone else read permissions to a single page and not to \nthe whole account? Or would the universal link be truly universal (i.e. \nnot ACL-protected at all)? Arguably it is easier for you to send the \npage to your accountant by email (send by value rather than send by \nreference).\n\nIf identity is confusing to geeks imagine how it would be to end-users \nif we started trying to give them every possible option. (but on the \nother hand, the pervasive concept of &quot;permalink&quot; shows that some people \nare innovating around issues of resource identity UI)\n\n2. In this case I don&#39;t see the relevance of which of the two \nauthorization regimes you use.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
