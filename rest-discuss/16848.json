Anyhow, that is how it works. The Server shou=\r\nld own its name space, so issuing a PUT with a URI defined by the client ma=\r\nkes no sense, right? \n\nActually, it makes no sense the client issuing a PUT=\r\n as a starting point for a REST interaction. That means, we can assume the =\r\nclient performs a GET first, and that has a document with all the links we =\r\nneed, including a PUT option. If so, what is the problem of that document a=\r\ndding the PUT and the actual URI that PUT has to use, that comes from serve=\r\nr, isn&#39;t it?\nFun discussions.\n\nWilliam Martinez Pomares.\n\n--- In rest-discu=\r\nss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;wahbedahbe&quot; &lt;andrew.wahbe@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ah, this deb=\r\nate again... it&#39;s a bit like debating the right way to eat soup with a fork=\r\n. The best approach is to take a big step back and come at the problem from=\r\n a slightly different angle (or utensil? ;-).\n&gt; \n&gt; A summary of my thoughts=\r\n:\n&gt; - there is no &quot;right&quot;, generic way to use PUT to update a resource that=\r\n works across all resources and media types except specifying verbatim how =\r\nthe resource should be represented in full. e.g. PUT the full .jpg image yo=\r\nu expect to be served in a subsequent GET of the resource\n&gt; \n&gt; - if you are=\r\n including enough data in a PUT to allow the the rest of the resource&#39;s sta=\r\nte to be derived by the server then you are ok. Alternatively, you can have=\r\n the server change the values the client suggests. This is my take on what =\r\nAtomPub does. It is necessary for things like identifiers and URIs (in gene=\r\nral hypermedia controls) that the server needs control over.\n&gt; \n&gt; - omittin=\r\ng information that the server is going to fill in is quite a different thin=\r\ng from a &quot;partial update&quot; -- don&#39;t confuse the two. To me a &quot;partial update=\r\n&quot; is when the full resource state cannot be derived from the information yo=\r\nu are providing and the previous state of the resource needs to be factored=\r\n in as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; - this leaves you with the problem of how the client know=\r\ns what information can be omitted (or is just a place-holder for the server=\r\n&#39;s values). This is either (a) specified by the media type definition or (b=\r\n) specified (or rather constrained) at run-time by a hypermedia control. I =\r\nbelieve that AtomPub is an example of (a) but I&#39;ve never seen an example of=\r\n (b) in the wild -- don&#39;t see why it is not possible though. \n&gt; \n&gt; In gener=\r\nal though, hypermedia controls for PUT (and DELETE) really need further exp=\r\nloration. I&#39;d like to see more examples of media types that describe how PU=\r\nT/DELETE should be used as well. I don&#39;t buy the &quot;you have the URI, so just=\r\n invoke PUT or DELETE on it&quot; generic approach -- you end up with problems l=\r\nike the one you are tackling here. At the end of the day though, unless you=\r\n think the idempotent property of PUT and DELETE is going to realize practi=\r\ncal benefits for your system, you might just be better off using POST.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Andrew\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;alex.scordellis&quot; &lt;alex.s=\r\ncordellis@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; After reading REST in Practice &lt;http:/=\r\n/restinpractice.com&gt; , I was\n&gt; &gt; puzzled by the authors&#39; recommendation of =\r\nPOST over PUT for resource\n&gt; &gt; updates. I thought through the implications =\r\nof some of the alternatives\n&gt; &gt; and wrote up my thoughts as a blog post\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;http://alexscordellis.blogspot.com/2010/11/restful-architecture-what-sh&#92;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; ould-we-put.html&gt; .

Clients have no b=\r\nusiness sending the hypermedia\n&gt; &gt; controls to the service, since they are =\r\ndetermined by resource state and\n&gt; &gt; business rules hosted by the server.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;     * Therefore we have to either PUT a partial representation (data, bu=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; no links), or use a different HTTP method, for the client to make a\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; change to the resource.\n&gt; &gt;     * However, there are many complications =\r\nwith using partial PUT, which\n&gt; &gt; are detailed in William Martinez&#39;s commen=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://alexscordellis.blogspot.com/2010/11/restful-architecture-what=\r\n-sh&#92;\n&gt; &gt; ould-we-put.html?showComment=3D1288962611437#c255996206325049719&gt; =\r\n and\n&gt; &gt; William Vambenepe&#39;s post &lt;http://stage.vambenepe.com/archives/1665=\r\n&gt; .\n&gt; &gt;     * These complications may force us to use POST for changes whic=\r\nh the\n&gt; &gt; client sees as full resource replacement, and therefore still fee=\r\nl more\n&gt; &gt; like they should be a PUT\n&gt; &gt;     * An alternative, variations o=\r\nf which were suggested by Garry Shutler\n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://alexscordellis.blogspot=\r\n.com/2010/11/restful-architecture-what-sh&#92;\n&gt; &gt; ould-we-put.html?showComment=\r\n=3D1288870660489#c5473614401681968877&gt;  and\n&gt; &gt; Duncan Cragg\n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://al=\r\nexscordellis.blogspot.com/2010/11/restful-architecture-what-sh&#92;\n&gt; &gt; ould-we=\r\n-put.html?showComment=3D1289244765256#c299846722503776739&gt; , is to\n&gt; &gt; sepa=\r\nrate the resource into two parts. One would be the resource that the\n&gt; &gt; cl=\r\nient sends to the service, and the other would be generated by the\n&gt; &gt; serv=\r\nice and include hypermedia controls and service-generated state\n&gt; &gt; informa=\r\ntion.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This has been a great debate. I&#39;ve learned a lot and it&#39;s fo=\r\nrced me to\n&gt; &gt; think things through very carefully; thank you to all partic=\r\nipants.\n&gt; &gt; However I feel it has so far been rather theoretical. I&#39;d be ve=\r\nry\n&gt; &gt; excited to hear from people who have tackled this problem in buildin=\r\ng\n&gt; &gt; real systems. What did you do? How did that work out? Did you hit any=\r\n of\n&gt; &gt; the complications of partial PUT described by the two Williams? If =\r\nyou\n&gt; &gt; used one of the alternatives, did you feel that had any drawbacks?\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Discuss!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
