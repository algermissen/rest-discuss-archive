Eval() always proved\nproblematic in any formalization of Linda semantics, just as POST is rather\nproblematic --- and in both cases .  In both, data is put into the information\nspace, evaluated, and results in new information.  Interesting to note that in POST\n--- due to the synchronous nature of HTTP - a single write/read is required, but\nwith eval()/in() a dual write/read is required.  Another difference is that eval is\na one-shot thing that turns into a single data tuple, while a POSTable resource is\na persistent thing that produces successive information without necessarily\ncreating new tuples / resources.\n\nMore later,\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
