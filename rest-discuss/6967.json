What might you\n&gt; be assessing for?\n&gt;\n&gt; Say you are interested in scaleability.  You should be able to\n&gt; evaluate that by inspecting the interactions of the system, looking\n&gt; for instances where the server must store conversational\n&gt; state in order to satisfy certain subsequent requests.  Finding\n&gt; none of that is an indicator, but not a guarantee, of scaleability,\n&gt; because the application may have poorly scaleable aspects\n&gt; not visible in the client interactions.\n\nWhich seemingly resolves to a subjective assessment?\nFine, identify it as such, perhaps give it a low weighting.\nI&#39;ve seen systems pointed to with clearer &#39;this is bad&#39; marks assigned.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Bill didn&#39;t say &quot;test&quot;; he said &quot;evaluate&quot;.  I think the above is an\n&gt; example of the latter.\n\nWow. subtle!\nI won&#39;t go there, my English isn&#39;t good enough.\nPerhaps different shades of gray?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Between the lines, I thought I read in your question whether\n&gt; or not there could be such a thing as a REST Test Suite, and I\n&gt; think the answer is &#39;no&#39;.\n\nThen how about a graded set of tests which anyone might\napply to gain some form of measure of the alignment\nof the system with the REST ideas?\n\n\nIs there such a ruler I could use to examine a system?\n\n\nNo is a perfectly valid answer to this question.\n\n\nregards\n\n-- \nDave Pawson\nXSLT XSL-FO FAQ.\nhttp://www.dpawson.co.uk\n\n"}}
