I understand =\r\nthat\n&gt; this works when the client is a human since there is a lot of human\n=\r\n&gt; intuition at play, however for machines this just seems an impractical\n&gt; =\r\nexpectation - which could be costly in terms of adoption of your\n&gt; applicat=\r\nion.\n&lt;/snip&gt;\nIt may be that m2m cases will require different semantics. For=\r\n example\nAtom semantics do not include any dynamic &quot;send&quot; options within th=\r\ne\ndocument itself other than possible &lt;link /&gt; elements w/o added\nparameter=\r\ns.  Atom handles &quot;send&quot; information by documenting\nrequired/optional data e=\r\nlements for POST(create) and PUT(update) and\nexpecting clients to have this=\r\n documentation information &quot;baked&quot; into\nthe client code.\n\nThese M2M semanti=\r\ncs, if fundamentally different, can most-likely be\nencoded in the response =\r\nrepresentation in a way that peacefully\nco-exists with the examples I gave =\r\nearlier in this thread. IOW, some\nclients might ignore parts of the reponse=\r\n they don&#39;t understand and\nonly &quot;re-act&quot; to sections or elements of the doc=\r\nument that &quot;make\nsense&quot; to that client. It is also possible that M2M client=\r\ns will need\nto negotiate w/ the server for their own media-type.\n\n&lt;snip&gt;\nIt=\r\n seems like requiring developers to build machine\n&gt; clients that interpret =\r\nseveral form changes/configurations is\n&gt; significantly more trouble than ju=\r\nst creating several distinct link\n&gt; relations that could carry equivalent s=\r\nemantics; adding extra link\n&gt; relations with the latter approach doesn&#39;t se=\r\nem like it would be any\n&gt; more disruptive than adding another form configur=\r\nation in the former.\n&lt;/snip&gt;\nIt&#39;s an interesting idea. I, myself have not d=\r\none what you describe\nhere. In the clients I&#39;ve written lately, interpretin=\r\ng the dynamic\narguments for a query is not a challenge. However, the hard w=\r\nork is\nmatching these &quot;place-holders&quot; w/ the client&#39;s existing local state\n=\r\ndata (&quot;which piece of data that I have in memory is the one to place\nin the=\r\n &quot;name&quot; field for this query?&quot;). So far, whether the queries are\ndynamic (v=\r\narying details included in the response representation) or\nstatic (rules wr=\r\nitten into the documentation are hard-coded in the\nclient), this match cont=\r\ninues to be the primary challenge for me.\n\nOne way I&#39;ve tackled this proble=\r\nm is to write documentation that lists\nall the possible argument elements t=\r\nhat might appear within queries or\n&quot;send&quot; operations. This allows client au=\r\nthors to code their own\nmapping of local state to the elements within the r=\r\nepresentations and\nexecute this &quot;resolution of state&quot; whenever the elements=\r\n appear in the\nrepresentation (including for &quot;send&quot; operations). I&#39;ve only =\r\ndone this\na couple times and it has been successful. However, I&#39;m not sure =\r\nhow\nrobust this solutions is over time (e.g. I&#39;ve not had the opportunity\nt=\r\no test this approach against the &quot;Architectural Properties of Key\nInterest&quot;=\r\n items mentioned in Roy&#39;s dissertation[1]).\n\nI&#39;d like to see more about how=\r\n (specifically) you are using link\nrelations to handle queries for M2M clie=\r\nnts. It&#39;d be interesting to me\nto see how your approach affects the actual =\r\nclient coding.\n\nFinally, I gave a talk recently that covers some high-level=\r\n aspects of\nmy client-coding work for Hypermedia. One of the aims of the ta=\r\nlk is\nto show how client-coding changes when the representations include\nhy=\r\npermedia elements.  The slides and source code (C#) are available\nfor downl=\r\noad[1]. I&#39;d be interested in any comments on this material.\n\n[1] http://www=\r\n.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/net_app_arch.htm#sec_2_3\n[2] http:=\r\n//amundsen.com/talks/#beyond-web20\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\nhttp://tw=\r\nitter.com@mamund\nhttp://mamund.com/foaf.rdf#me\n\n\n#RESTFest 2010\nhttp://rest=\r\n-fest.googlecode.com\n\n\n\n\nOn Sun, Nov 28, 2010 at 09:34, Mike Kelly &lt;mike@my=\r\nkanjo.co.uk&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi mike!\n&gt;\n&gt; On Sat, Nov 27, 2010 at 4:32 PM, mike am=\r\nundsen &lt;mamund@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; - include suipport for &quot;send&quot; elements =\r\n(POST PUT DELETE)\n&gt;&gt; &lt;root&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;send-collection&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =A0&lt;send href=3D&quot;{...}&quot;=\r\n rel=3D&quot;add-new-case-file&quot;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0&lt;data name=3D&quot;title&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0...=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; =A0&lt;/send&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =A0&lt;send href=3D&quot;{...}&quot; rel=3D&quot;delete-case-file&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n=A0...\n&gt;&gt; &lt;/send-collection&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Again, train your clients to look for and u=\r\nnderstand &quot;send&quot; elements\n&gt;&gt; and you have the ability to add/remove these o=\r\nperations based on the\n&gt;&gt; state of the client at the moment, changes in app=\r\nlication-flow on the\n&gt;&gt; server, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is it really reasonable to expect =\r\nyour machine clients to react and\n&gt; comprehend these sort of &#39;form&#39; changes=\r\n at run time?
