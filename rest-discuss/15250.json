You see, there are two layers there: business and developers. =\r\nBusiness guys were sold the idea of SOA as a business oriented architecture=\r\n. But then developers were told to use SOAP. Then someone came and said RES=\r\nT was better to do services, simpler. And thus REST is the easy way of doin=\r\ng services nowadays.\n\nAll that I said is flawed! SOA has nothing to do with=\r\n REST (sorry guys, I know many that do think it does, but I mean SOA as Ser=\r\nvice Oriented Architecture, the hard definition), one focuses on businesses=\r\n and the other is for networked systems and transfers (the web). SOAP is no=\r\nt the only option for SOA, and REST should not be a developer&#39;s only tool.\n=\r\n\nSo, there are many trying to get REST into their systems, but what they me=\r\nan is simple replacing the SOAP calls. The people that actually think on do=\r\ning a complete architectural refactoring is not that many. \n\nLastly, the ot=\r\nher component is the adoption percentage of the style. I mean with this, ho=\r\nw much of the style is being adopted. You see, REST has many constrains, so=\r\nme are required, some other are optional. Each constrain is there to get a =\r\nbenefit. People usually over read the dissertation and implements using a c=\r\nouple of constrains, leaving out some others. The most problematic is the H=\r\nypertext as the engine of application state. It is what everybody checks fi=\r\nrst to see if you have REST, and say it is totally required, but it is the =\r\none where most people fail implementing. So, you may have companies with 50=\r\n% REST adoption, 80% REST adoption and so on (some adopt that percentage of=\r\n style&#39;s constrains, but not being RESTfull yet!). \n\nChecking on what is on=\r\n paper, and what is actually in practice, and checking if the benefits are =\r\nreal thus providing an evaluation of the theory, is a good research.\n\nCheer=\r\ns!\n\nWilliam Martinez\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Jan Algermissen =\r\n&lt;algermissen1971@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Sean,\n&gt; \n&gt; On Apr 14, 2010, at 12:27 PM, S=\r\nean Kennedy wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt;    I am a PhD student and I am =\r\ntrying to find out the level of shift in the enterprise-space from SOAP/POX=\r\n WS to RESTful WS. I get a strong feeling that there is a substantial shift=\r\n in this direction\n&gt; \n&gt; The shift is happening, but it appears that it is m=\r\nostly a shift of hyped terms only and not a real architectural shift.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nThe true application of REST would be a radical shift towards simplicity an=\r\nd decoupling and as far as my experience goes, enterprises are not yet will=\r\ning to let go of complexity :-) I have recently persuaded myself that the u=\r\nbiquitiousness of object-oriented thinking is a major obstacle. We have all=\r\n been so immersed in OOA, OOD, classes, interfaces, etc. that it is really =\r\nhard to think differently about software systems. Maybe the apparent rise o=\r\nf functional languages helps to cure that situation...\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; but I have no=\r\n examples or figures that bear it out...\n&gt; \n&gt; I think many enterprise under=\r\nstand that there is a benefit induced by REST and start trying. But it is e=\r\nxtremely rare, for example, that people understand that media type design i=\r\ns at the heart of all design activity (as opposed to service interface desi=\r\ngn, which is an implementation detail in REST).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Jan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nThanks,\n&gt; &gt; Sean.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --------------------------------=\r\n---\n&gt;  Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n&gt;  NORD Software Consulting\n&gt; \n&gt;  Mail: =\r\nalgermissen@...\n&gt;  Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n&gt;  Work: http://www.no=\r\nrdsc.com/\n&gt; -----------------------------------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
