The only=\r\n problem I\n&gt; have with it is the development overhead needed for reading ou=\r\nt\n&gt; semantic data in M2M scenarios. Why? Because there is no standard\n&gt; gen=\r\neric way of embedding machine readable data in HTML.\n&gt;\n\nWell, yes, RDFa and=\r\n microdata.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, it is possible to use tables and other markup element=\r\ns as you\n&gt; describe. But you will have to handcraft the decoding on the cli=\r\nent\n&gt; side for each and every resource type.\n&gt; \n\nYes, with microformats, bu=\r\nt the problem of needing a parser for every\nvocabulary is solved by RDFa, s=\r\no I don&#39;t understand your reservations\nabout it.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t have to lea=\r\nrn some new, undocumented media type by reverse-\n&gt; engineering a system&#39;s f=\r\nunctionality.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is where I do not agree. Yes, the media type is wel=\r\nl known, but\n&gt; the embedding format is not. Now you need to reverse enginee=\r\nre how\n&gt; the domain data is embedded.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have the same problem with mic=\r\nro formats: they work nicely with\n&gt; HTML, but you have to write specialized=\r\n encoders/decoders for each\n&gt; and every format out there.\n&gt; \n\nAn RDFa parse=\r\nr can easily generate name-value pairs.  How those are\ninterpreted by your =\r\nsystem is up to you.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Compare this to a generic serialization format li=\r\nke XML or JSON where \n&gt; encoding and decoding comes for free for just about=\r\n all object\n&gt; formats.\n&gt; \n\nI don&#39;t want to.  I don&#39;t consume RDFa as RDF, I=\r\n read it with XPath.  I\neven use RDFa attributes in my CSS to make it more =\r\nmaintainable, vs.\nmaking up @class / @id values for each project.  What I&#39;m=\r\n trying to\naccomplish is making my hypertext accessible to others, includin=\r\ng those\nwho wish to consume it as RDF, even though that isn&#39;t how _I_ build=\r\n\nsystems.  General-purpose language for exchanging object interfaces, is\nal=\r\nl I&#39;m looking for.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; RDFa could be a solution to this, but its triplet s=\r\nemantics requires\n&gt; some thinking out of the box for object encoding.\n&gt;\n\nWh=\r\nich is why I keep saying we&#39;re not encoding objects in hypertext,\nwe&#39;re usi=\r\nng hypertext to provide a generic object interface.  All RDFa\nis to me, is =\r\na way to annotate this interface; then I struggle with\nmaking it sensible t=\r\no RDFa parsers and let anyone who wants to consume\nit worry about relating =\r\nwhatever my triplet semantics happen to be, back\nto the problem at hand.  I=\r\nt isn&#39;t my starting point.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
