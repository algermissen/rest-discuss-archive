It isn&#39;t publicly\n&gt; available (yet).\n&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Below I assume you think about in-browser (js) code that will be\n&gt;  &gt; expanding the templates, right?\n&gt;\n&gt; In my context, this isn&#39;t necessarily in-browser code, or js code (more\n&gt; likely Java, C# or Perl code). But yes, I &#39;m talking about client side\n&gt; expansion of URI templates communicated by the server.\n&gt;\n\nah ok, since you mentioned XHTML I just assumed browser-client and \nexpanded further to assume javascript, sorry for that\n\n&gt;  &gt; Anyway, in terms of HTML such I think the lists of contexts could be\n&gt;  &gt; provided by any repeating thing like ul/li, table/tr, p\n&gt;\n&gt; Interesting. This resonates with the problem Eric wrote about:\n&gt; dynamically passing a declarative description of constraints on allowed\n&gt; values for expansion. In your example, you communicate a list of\n&gt; possible contexts for expansion. A context is a set of value for\n&gt; performing a given expansion. Do I understand correctly? If so, I&#39;m not\n&gt; sure why you don&#39;t directly pass to the client a list of URI generated\n&gt; server-side by expanding the &quot;templates&quot; using the various contexts? I&#39;m\n\nWell, that surely *is* an option as I mentioned myself, but if you go \nthis path, then you don&#39;t need to provide the client with uri-templates \nnor contexts, and you don&#39;t need anything else then the xhtml we already \nhave...\n\nSo I just assumed you meant this, if not it seemed to make your question \nvoid?\n\n&gt; certainly missing some pieces here!\n&gt;\n\nNot sure, maybe I&#39;m missing the pieces, but here is my line of thinking: \n  if you think about sending uri-templates to the client, then I assume \nyou want it doing the expansions, and thus, that client will need to \nhave a way to access, derive, produce the contexts for that...\n\nSo really, in my mind relating this issue to XHTML (as per your subject) \nreally opens up two interesting issues:\n\n[1] a way to send the uri-templates (link/ref, or the suggested hreft, \nsrct variants) ... or ...\n\n[2] and a way to send the contexts\n\nregards,\n-marc=\n\n&gt; Philippe\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
