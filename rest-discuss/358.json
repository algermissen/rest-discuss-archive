I don&#39;t particularly like any of these, do you?\n\n..see following message for detailed comments.\n\n&gt; &gt; Requiring clients to act as HTTP/1.1 servers is a fatal security problem.\n&gt;\n&gt; Why?  Running such on a &quot;client&quot; is no worse than running one on a\n&gt; &quot;server&quot; in the\n&gt; first place.\n\nMany many reasons.  The risks of running public servers are well known.  They\nare administered by skilled specialists and even so are generally outside (or\nright on) the firewall.  The skill and commitment of users is lower.  The\nmachine setup is less secure.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; No\n&gt; &gt; competent security admin would let it happen.\n&gt;\n&gt; Let&#39;s design for the application, okay, rather than the admin.\n&gt; Administration is a\n&gt; significant but separate series of concerns.\n\nFor once I am describing admins as competent bots rather than incompetent ones.\nThis doesn&#39;t happen often.\ns/competent security admin/competent userbot/\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; What about server-server callbacks, meaning callbacks from\n&gt; server-class machine to\n&gt; server-class machine, both in actively administered environments, both already\n&gt; running HTTP server software?  In this case, you&#39;re not really\n&gt; compromising the\n&gt; security of either system, are you?\n&gt;\n&gt; I would suggest that the scope of this effort is to determine how to allow one\n&gt; resource-modeled entity to register an interest in state changes of a second\n&gt; resource and subsequently receive notifications from that second\n&gt; resource.  Such a\n&gt; scope presumes that both systems hosting these resources can\n&gt; symmetrically initiate\n&gt; connections and that both systems are secured at an appropriate level by their\n&gt; respective administrators.  Asymmetry of connectivity is a separate issue.\n\nI think that it&#39;s a good idea to separate the requirements for callbacks between\nserver-class pairs and between server/client pairs.  I think that notifications\nbetween server pairs are great functionality.  I don&#39;t think that the problem\nwill be solved until clients can receive notifications.\n\n(More to follow).\n\n- Lucas\n\n\n\n\n"}}
