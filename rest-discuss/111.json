I think I&#39;ve seen the following options\n&gt; discussed here:\n&gt; \n&gt;  1. through a new method\n&gt; \n&gt; WATCH /blah/blah\n&gt; \n&gt;  2. through the existence of a new header in a POST\n&gt; \n&gt; Reply-to: http://....\n&gt; \n&gt;  3. through a form parameter in a POST\n&gt; \n&gt; &reply-to=http://....\n&gt; \n&gt;  4. through a POST of a content type\n&gt; \n&gt; Content-type: application/www-notification-request\n&gt; \n&gt;  5. The application could merely &quot;know&quot; that when a POST is made to a\n&gt; particular URI that the request is for a notification.\n&gt; \n&gt; I guess I prefer 2, the reply-to header. Lucas, why do your examples use\n&gt; 3? I would rather leave the POST body completely in the domain of the\n&gt; application because what if the application wants to pass XML or\n&gt; graphics as the body? \n\nRight.  #3 is a crude form of RPC, equivalent to #4 (and #5 if you think\nabout it).\n\nBut #2, with that header, isn&#39;t sufficient either.  I assume that you\nwere trying to use my WATCH-as-PUT example where only an extension\nheader was required?  If so, the header there works quite differently\nthan just &quot;Reply-To&quot;.\n\nI also prefer the new method.  A practical reason is that the meaning is\nmore obvious, especially to most firewalls that permit blocking based\non methods.  None I know of can follow a hypertext transaction to\nunderstand what you&#39;re really doing with GET, follow-header, PUT/POST,\netc..  Though there&#39;s no reason that they can&#39;t, they don&#39;t.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
