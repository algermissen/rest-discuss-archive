[1]\n\nHTML is as much a=\r\ns structuring text as it is about presentation\n(although the tendency and r=\r\necommendation is to use CSS for that, but\nnevertheless the markup is there)=\r\n.  So, if my main goal is not to make\na website but to allow services to ac=\r\ncess my data in a  &quot;machines\ntalking to machines&quot; way, why should I care ab=\r\nout &lt;b&gt;bolds&lt;/&gt; and\n&lt;i&gt;italics&lt;/i&gt;? Why should I care about accessibility a=\r\nt all? That is\na problem for web designers to deal, not to a &quot;data provider=\r\n&quot; service\ndesigner...\n\nSo why not put the focus on XML, that &quot;is a set of r=\r\nules for encoding\ndocuments in machine-readable form&quot;,&quot;widely used for the\n=\r\nrepresentation of arbitrary data structures&quot; [2]?\n\nWhy use HTML that &quot;tells=\r\n you how data should look&quot; instead of XML that\n&quot;tells you what it means&quot;, t=\r\nhat &quot;applies context to the data&quot;, and\n&quot;separates data content from data pr=\r\nesentation&quot;[3]?\n\nWouldn&#39;t you agree that REST is much more than a glorified=\r\n way of\nmaking web sites?\n\nSo I would say: use HTML for your general purpos=\r\ne (data/presentation)\nservices, use XML for your specific purpose (data) se=\r\nrvices. Create\nyour own Media-Type. Create hundreds, thousands of new Media=\r\n-Types.\nDon&#39;t wait for some organization to define then from the top-down. =\r\nDo\nit yourself from the ground-up and encourage others to do the same.\nFrom=\r\n all of those I&#39;m sure much more than 0.01% will be adopted for\nspecific ar=\r\neas of business - it will happen as soon they see it\nworks...\n\n[1] http://l=\r\nogicerror.com/timsDream\n[2] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML\n[3] http://xml=\r\n.gov/presentations/gsa/sld001.htm\n\n\n\n\n2010/7/21 Eric J.
