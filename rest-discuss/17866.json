Speaking in terms of Mike Amundsen&#39;s H-Factors, it covers qu=\r\nite a few.  I can even live without support for DELETE and PUT.  However, I=\r\n find that I want the link-relation stuff for things that aren&#39;t &lt;a&gt; or &lt;li=\r\nnk&gt; elements.  \n\nFor example, when the state of the application will suppor=\r\nt creating a new resource, rather than a &lt;link&gt; element pointing to where I=\r\n would POST the resource, I would rather use a &lt;form&gt; element to make it ex=\r\nplicit what may be posted there.  The @action attribute takes care of where=\r\n to post it, but what would I use for the equivalent of @rel here to show t=\r\nhe relationship from the current application state? \n\nAre there any convent=\r\nions for this? Or is what I&#39;m doing unusual or even unwise?\n\n\n\n\n"}}
