As ISO says, you&#39;re not just\n&gt; exchanging data, you&#39;re making business commitments.\n\nThere is something else going on, but it is an extension of HTTP. I\nthink of things like WebDAV and Offer/Acceptance as plugins. You should\nbe able to trivially build an application using a mix of WebDAV and\nOffer/Acceptance at the same time. Individual resources should be able\nto mix bits of WebDAV and Offer/Acceptance in the same message (if they\nmake logical sense together in a particular message). Whereas, HTTP and\nSMTP are really layered on top of TCP so you can&#39;t have a single TCP\nconnection being both HTTP and SMTP at the same time. As usual, it is\nimpossible to say anything authoritative about how SOAP would fit in.\nYou can use it as a layer above HTTP (bad programmer!) or as an\nextension to HTTP (but what does it add?) \n\n&gt; Rohit Khare had an interesting diagram in his recent Soap Routing\n&gt; slide show where he added two layers on top the application protocol:\n&gt; Layer 8 - Economic (which is where business commitments cd go)\n&gt; Layer 9 - Political.\n\nI was at the talk and in that context it was clear that he meant it more\nas a joke. Not &quot;economic protocols&quot; like ebXML but &quot;economic protocols&quot;\nlike -- how do I con venture capitalists into giving me money?\n\n-- \nCome discuss XML and REST web services at:\n  Open Source Conference: July 22-26, 2002, conferences.oreillynet.com\n  Extreme Markup: Aug 4-9, 2002,  www.extrememarkup.com/extreme/\n\n"}}
