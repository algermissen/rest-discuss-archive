Typically I would pass a \nquery string, such as this:\n\nhttp://localhost/my-app/my-page?page=1&pagesize=10&sortcolumn=1&desc=1\n\nI understand the problem of the atomicity of each &#39;page&#39; of data (as \nadditional items might arrive in the dataset while the user is viewing \neach page, something I could address with a &#39;version&#39; in the URI if I \nfelt it was necessary, however that is not presently my concern).\n\nIs the query string the correct place for these types of parameters? (I \nkind of have the impression that I&#39;m supposed to be avoiding parameters \naltogether, but I&#39;m not sure how to easily do that, especially when my \nrequest contains more than a strict &#39;hierarchy&#39;, being somewhat \n&#39;multidimensional&#39;).\n\nShould I flatten out my URI to something like this:\n\nhttp://localhost/my-app/my-page/1-10-1-1/\n\nThus allowing for variations such as:\n\nhttp://localhost/my-app/my-page/1-10-1-1/pdf/\n(a PDF representation of &#39;my-page&#39; for the first 10 items, ordered by \ncolumn 1 descending)\n\nhttp://localhost/my-app/my-page/1-10-1-1/html-3.2/\n(a HTML 3.2 representation of &#39;my-page&#39; for the first 10 items, ordered \nby column 1 descending)\n\nhttp://localhost/my-app/my-page/1-10-1-1/html-4.01/green/\n(a HTML 4.01 representation of &#39;my-page&#39; with a &#39;green&#39; theme for the \nfirst 10 items, ordered by column 1 descending)\n\netc..\n\nAs the &#39;sub-hierarchies&#39; are not strictly subordinates of their parent, \nis is poor design to represent a request for such a representation in \nthe path?\n\nIf the answer is that I should use the query to request pagination, \nformat, or style, then why wouldn&#39;t I create URIs like this:\n\nhttp://localhost/server?application=my-app&resource=my-page&page-options=1-10-1-1&format=html-4.01&style=green\n\nCan anyone offer guidance on when I should prefer the &#39;path&#39; section of \na URI over the &#39;query&#39; section? Is there any material I should read on \nthis topic?\n\nAt what point does a &#39;resource identifier&#39; stop being a &#39;path&#39; and start \nbeing a &#39;query&#39;..?\n\nJohn.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
