Like all architectural styles, REST is a\nselection of trade-offs. One of these is that the uniform interface\ndegrades effeciency in order to improve visibility, which results in a\nmore verbose exchange between client and server.\n\nRegards,\nAlan Dean\nhttp://twitter.com/adean\n\nOn Sat, Feb 21, 2009 at 7:59 AM, ramsub4 &lt;ramsub4@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Could HTTP DELETE carry a body? I didn&#39;t see a mention of this in\n&gt; RFC2616. If it&#39;s not allowed, how would you perform DELETE on multiple\n&gt; resources?As &quot;;&quot; separated params? If the DELETE request can carry a\n&gt; body, we can specify the individual resources in the body itself.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; -rama\n\n"}}
