For example, can one reuse \n&gt; UML and the tools available for working with it to model an application \n&gt; using REST?\n\nFor some stuff, probably.  I stopped using these tools about the time I\ngrokked REST, so it&#39;s hard for me to say for sure.  You&#39;d just have to\nstart out with some common classes, such as those I define in RestRDF,\nfrom which all distributed components inherit their interfaces.\n\nBeyond that, most of these tools use methodologies which are not well\nsuited to a data-transfer centric architecture such as REST, so any type\nof simulation or execution would likely be problematic.\n\nI&#39;m sure we&#39;ll see the tools vendors catch up soon enough.\n\n&gt; (I&#39;m asking from ignorance here; I know of these tools and appreciate \n&gt; their place in the universe, but don&#39;t use them.)\n\nI used to use them extensively.  I&#39;m glad I don&#39;t anymore.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
