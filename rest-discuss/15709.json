The product page should be the same for all users=\r\n, but the shopping cart should be individual for each user. But if the page=\r\n is the same for all users, it cannot contain an individual URI for the use=\r\nr&#39;s shopping cart!\n\nMy idea is to store the cart URI in a cookie and reques=\r\nt the cart form the server with content of that cookie. The process looks l=\r\nike this:\n\n1. Client: GET /product\n2. Server: Ok, product page\n3. Client: P=\r\nOST /cart (requested with JavaScript)\n4. Server: Created, Location: /cart/9=\r\n3a41fe545b, set_cookie: /cart/93a41fe545b\n\n... on the next page:\n\n5. Client=\r\n: GET /another_product\n6. Server: Ok, another product page\n7. Client: GET /=\r\ncart/93a41fe545b (requested with JavaScript after reading the cookie)\n8. Se=\r\nrver: Ok, user&#39;s shopping cart\n\nMaybe the actual creation of the shopping c=\r\nart can be deferred until the first item is placed into the cart, but that =\r\nis not important for my example. Important is the mechanism to store the ca=\r\nrt URI in a cookie and request and display the cart with JavaScript.\n\nIs th=\r\nere a way to do something similar without JavaScript?\n\nWhat do you think of=\r\n this approach?\n\n\nAnother idea: \n\nSince this kind of shopping cart could be=\r\n shared between users (e. g. configure a computer for someone else and send=\r\n the URI of the cart) it would make sense, to make shopping carts immutable=\r\n. If the cart is modified, the user gets a new cart URI, so that all previo=\r\nus versions would still be available. The obvious shortcoming is that many =\r\ncarts will be stored over time ... But disk space is cheap and old, unused =\r\ncarts could be removed after a while. Any opinion?\n\nRegards\nChristian\n\n\n --=\r\n \nhttp://scala-forum.org/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
