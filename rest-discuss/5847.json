Look at these\n&gt;&gt; two URIs:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    http://www.google.com/search?q=REST\n&gt;&gt;    http://www.google.com/search?q=This+is+spinal+tap\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t think you&#39;d consider google.com one big resource.\n&gt;\n&gt; google.com is the naming authority and /search is the resource. You\n&gt; don&#39;t have to think of /search as one big resource that contains these\n&gt; small resources specified via a Query String. You can think of it as a\n&gt; resource that gives you some way of getting to other resources by\n&gt; providing &quot;identifying information&quot; [1] in the Query String.\n&gt;\n&gt; Note that both the URI&#39;s (including the query mark and the query\n&gt; string after it) you mentioned *are used to identify* quasi-static [2]\n&gt; resources which can be cached till the next time google updates its\n&gt; index.\n&gt;\nI think there&#39;s some overloading of the term resource going on here.  \nThe way I&#39;ve come to think of it, a resource is that which is  \nidentified by a URI. So if it&#39;s a different URI, it is a different  \nresource. Therefore, the following are two different resources:\n\nhttp://www.google.com/search?q=REST\nhttp://www.google.com/search?q=This+is+spinal+tap\n\nMy definition of resource comes from the HTTP perspective. You said,  \n&quot;You don&#39;t have to think of /search as being on big resource...&quot; To  \nme, you&#39;re not talking about the HTTP perspective here, but about how  \nhumans would think of the information architecture of Google. I think  \nthat&#39;s important to consider when designing a web app, because the  \nURI is part of the user interface. URIs can be designed to help the  \nuser understand and better navigate the site. But users don&#39;t think  \nin terms of resources. For lack of a better word, I&#39;ll use &quot;content.&quot;\n\nAs an illustration, I posted a question to this list recently about  \nwhether it made sense to consider personalization of a resource a  \nrepresentation of that resource. I eventually realized that the  \ntrouble with that approach is that if you have 1000 ETags for 1000  \ndifferent personalized versions of a resource, and a proxy has all of  \nthem cached, the If-None-Match request header would likely be bigger  \nthan size of the representation. That defeats the purpose of caching,  \nwhich tells me that the number of possible representations, and  \ntherefore ETags, for each resource needs to be fairly small.\n\nSo now, if you search Google for REST and hit this page on one of my  \nsites:\n\nhttp://lejava.artima.com/articles/rest_easy\n\nI&#39;ll notice that the referrer was:\n\nhttp://www.google.com/search?q=REST\n\nAnd I&#39;ll redirect the browser to:\n\nhttp://lejava.artima.com/articles/rest_easy?q=REST\n\nThis URI will show the same article, but with the term &quot;rest&quot;  \nhighlighted. From the HTTP perspective, these are two different  \nresources:\n\nhttp://lejava.artima.com/articles/rest_easy\nhttp://lejava.artima.com/articles/rest_easy?q=REST\n\nBut from the user&#39;s perspective, they are two different views of the  \nsame piece of content, which is an article about REST. Therefore, the  \nquery string parameterizes the content, from the user&#39;s perspective,  \nbut not the resource. From the HTTP perspective, a URI is opaque, and  \neach unique string identifies a unique resource regardless of whether  \nit contains a question mark.\n\nDoes this way of thinking about the term &quot;resource&quot; sound correct?\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nEditor-in-Chief\nArtima Developer\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n"}}
