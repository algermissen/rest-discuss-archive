Mike Dierken&quot; &lt;mdierken@h...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; I&#39;m defining a REST based interface to an internal system at work\nand wanted to clarify some design questions (especially around the use\nof PUT and the use of &#39;synthesized&#39; resources).\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m trying to model a system where multiple input documents (all\nXML) are used to generate a single final document. The submitted\ndocuments have their own identifiers (owned by the client) and the\nsubmitters do not know the identifier for the final document. The\nfinal document might or might not exist when a submission is received.\nI&#39;m also trying to not use POST for everything.\n&gt; \nI was wondering what your reasons are for not considering a service\nbased approach where the client constructs a request containing all\nthe input documents and the response is the merged document?\n\nI don&#39;t think this violates the principles of REST and it simplifies\nthings quite a bit.\n\nThe practicalities would be that your client could construct a\nmultipart body containing all the input document and POST it to your\nservice URI. The service could then process the request and return a\nnon-cacheable response with the merged document as the body.\n\nCheers,\nTony\n\n\n"}}
