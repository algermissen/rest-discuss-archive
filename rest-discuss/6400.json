How\n&gt;is the view=3Dedit resource discovered? (I think that&#39;s=\r\n part of the original\n&gt;question).\n&gt;\n\nI&#39;m just learning Atom Publishing Prot=\r\nocol, actually as I write this, is that what you mean by discovery?  In whi=\r\nch case I think it&#39;s a moot point since the discovery document explicitly s=\r\ntates that /resource is editable via PUT, provided the user requesting the =\r\ndiscovery document has that level of permission (according to their AUTH he=\r\nader).  Do I have that right?\n\nIf so, then the ;view=3Dedit bit is a nicety=\r\n provided for clients, i.e. any client I&#39;m implementing a web presence for =\r\nwho wants an edit form not an APP client and they &quot;discover&quot; this resource =\r\nbecause I either tell them it&#39;s there, or link to it.  Many people are used=\r\n to having a server-side form for editing web content, typically edit.php?i=\r\nd=3Dresource and it was _that_ sort of solution I was trying to avoid.\n\nYes=\r\n, it&#39;s a resource in its own right.  But I also define it to be a represent=\r\nation since it&#39;s generated from the same source content using XSLTC on the =\r\nserver.  So its content is never different from the &quot;base resource&quot; and it =\r\nis not editable in its own right, i.e. there&#39;s no PUT allowed to http://exa=\r\nmple.com/resource;view=3Dedit.
