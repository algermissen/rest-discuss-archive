Currently, thesemarkers are the visual cues that\n&gt; are render=\r\ned by common Web browsers via the messages sent by servers\n&gt; in the most ub=\r\niquitous human-centered hypermedia format of the day;\n&gt; HTML.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Semantic=\r\n meaning&quot; is an emergent property. In the case of HTML that\n&gt; property is &quot;=\r\ncreated&quot; by humans when they observe the visual\n&gt; &quot;landscape&quot; rendered by =\r\n=A0Web browsers.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does anyone here want to assert that this &quot;semantic me=\r\naning&quot; can\n&gt; _only_ emerge when humans are *directly* involved in the real-=\r\ntime\n&gt; interpretation of messages that contain these (or similar) markers?\n=\r\n\nAfaict, there&#39;s a spectrum of sophistication here. I haven&#39;t seen a\nclient=\r\n implementation which demonstrates automated capabilities which\ncome &#39;close=\r\n&#39; to that of a human, we&#39;re basically talking about the\nweb&#39;s version of a =\r\nTuring Test.\n\nMost of the evidence so far suggests this is the case, althou=\r\ngh I am\nnot an AI expert.\n\n&gt; Or\n&gt; is it possible that humans can &quot;code&quot; age=\r\nnts to have (at least some\n&gt; of) this same ability to recognize, parse, and=\r\n activate the\n&gt; &quot;affordances&quot; found in the hypermedia landscape?\n&gt;\n&gt; It is =\r\nmy assertion that the latter is the case. I also contend that\n&gt; making the =\r\nassumption that this is possible is a key step in advancing\n&gt; the art and t=\r\nheory of distributed hypermedia.\n&gt;\n\nI think it&#39;s an interesting research to=\r\npic but the complexity of\nproducing these sorts of clients is so high, it&#39;s=\r\n inevitable that only\na small portion of your client base will behave this =\r\nway (unless you\ncontrol them all, in which case your system is not very dis=\r\ntributed!).\nSo, in practice, you will be forced to only evolve your applica=\r\ntion in\na way that caters to the lowest common denominator - undermining th=\r\ne\neffort that has gone into more sophisticated clients. This is a big\nchall=\r\nenge to overcome in and of itself, irrespective of the challenge\nof inventi=\r\nng the designs for such an autonomous hypermedia agent.\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n"}}
