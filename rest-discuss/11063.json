I read the link you posted. You&#39;re talking\nabout =\r\n&quot;Web proxy cache&quot;, that&#39;s something I never had to deal with so\nfar, becaus=\r\ne I&#39;m used to developing low visits/day sites.\n\nIt&#39;s good to know I have th=\r\nis available, but for the moment, that\nincreases complexibility and reduces=\r\n flexibility in my solution. All\nmy caching is controlled through my applic=\r\nation. I have 2 types of\ncache so far, one for the midle tiers, as you desc=\r\nribed, and another\nfor the Web tier. This last one is a filter (servlet) th=\r\nat modifies my\nrequests and set far future expires and such. It retrieves a=\r\nll its\nconfigurations from may application database, and I have a very simp=\r\nle\ncrud interface where the final (admin) user can change these values at\nw=\r\nill.\n\nThank you all for your answers, very enlightening. I&#39;ve read about\nsq=\r\nuid before (I use it in my company btw), and I read a lot about\ncaching too=\r\n. Never made the squid/application-side-caching connection\nbefore.\n\n--- In =\r\nrest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, &quot;mike amundsen&quot; &lt;mamund@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; First=\r\n, you might want to check out Mark Nottingham&#39;s talk on howSquid\n&gt; can be u=\r\nsed within the enterprise:\n&gt; http://www.mnot.net/blog/2007/04/29/squid\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n This is what I am currently doing right now to implement a &#39;local\n&gt; cache&#39;=\r\n within my coding framework:\n&gt; \n&gt; I define a CaheObject that has a set of p=\r\nroperties including Uri,\n&gt; VaryBy, ContentType, ETag, LastModDate, Payload =\r\nand others\n&gt; I define a CacheService class that has methods like AddToCache=\r\n,\n&gt; GetFromCache, RemoveFromCache\n&gt; I modify my HTTPRequest handlers to imp=\r\nlement the local caching:\n&gt; - on GET/HEAD requests, pass the Uri to the Get=\r\nFromCache()\n&gt;   if I get an object, check the ETag/Last-Mod info against th=\r\ne request\n&gt; and return 304 if appropriate\n&gt;   if I get valid object, return=\r\n the payload and stop\n&gt;   if I get a null object, do wahtever is needed to =\r\nbuild the object,\n&gt; stick it in cache, and return the results as usual\n&gt; - =\r\non POST/DELETE\n&gt;   after doing the work, clear out any related cache items =\r\n(i keep a\n&gt; running list)\n&gt; - on PUT\n&gt;   use the Etag of the cached item to=\r\n make sure this is a valid update\n&gt; (return 412 if not)\n&gt;   do the update\n&gt;=\r\n   remove any related cache items (using my list)\n&gt; \n&gt; I implement this pat=\r\ntern throughout my coding.
