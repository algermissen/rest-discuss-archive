I&#39;m thinking that my case is\n&gt; not very unique and that this is a general topic for REST. (i.e. how\n&gt; to embed URLs in URLs - if one can say that).\n&gt;\n&gt; So as I&#39;m searching for a hash algorithm that I could use (a client\n&gt; should be able to reverse the hash to get the URL an vice versa), I&#39;m\n&gt; thinking that if there was a best practice for doing this in REST,\n&gt; that would be a good thing. E.g. clients could exploit this\n&gt; information somehow. Does there exist such a &quot;best practice&quot;, or\n&gt; should there be one?\n&gt;\n&gt; And finally; any hash-algorithms that you recommend?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; - Erling\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
