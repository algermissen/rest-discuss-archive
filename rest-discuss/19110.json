In this case,\n&gt; the capability of maintaining a URI as an entry point for resource X\n&gt; &quot;forever&quot;.\n&gt; \n\nI have no idea where participants in this thread are getting this\nnotion.  In the case of an excerpt of one document appearing in\nanother, rel=&#39;bookmark&#39; identifies a permalink, is all.  When appearing\nin the &lt;head&gt; of a transient message, say a purchase confirmation from\na shopping cart, it can give the UA a permalink to the order in the CRM\nsystem, in lieu of the current URI, if the user bookmarks the receipt.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The only resource that has the bookmark contract from the start is\n&gt; the API&#39;s entry point (root). For the rest, may them be of type\n&gt; bookmark or not, the client needs to know the freedoms and\n&gt; responsibilities it has for bookmarking them.\n&gt; \n\nI know of no such contract.  Nor does REST endorse an &quot;entry point&quot; for\nany API.  I see a whole lot in this thread that folks are reading in to\nREST, which is really neither here nor there.
