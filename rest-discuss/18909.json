If resource B does not exist, I would like the same PUT request to\nfail, responding with a status code that indicates to the client that\nresource A does not exist. So what is a good status code to respond with in\nthe failure case? I considered 403 Forbidden but its semantics say that\n&quot;the request should not be repeated&quot;. This does not quite make sense in my\napplication since resource A might come into existence in the future,\nmaking it okay for the client to re-issue the same PUT request for resource\nB.\n\nAlternatively (or additionally?), perhaps the client could issue a\nconditional PUT on resource B which would only succeed if resource A\nexisted. How could I express such a condition in HTTP? I considered using\nthe If-Match request header but that seems to apply to representations of\nthe same resource (in my example, B) rather than of other resources (in my\nexample, A).\n\nThank you,\n\nShaunak\n\n-- \n&quot;Now the hardness of this world slowly grinds your dreams away / Makin&#39; a\nfool&#39;s joke out of the promises we make&quot; --- Bruce Springsteen, &quot;Blood\nBrothers&quot;\n\r\n--90e6ba1efee803426e04c3eb496d\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nHi folks,&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I am looking to model an interaction in my RES=\r\nT application where the client should only be allowed to modify a resource =\r\n(say &quot;B&quot;) if another resource (say &quot;A&quot;) exists.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Using HTTP, if resource A exists, I would like PUT /uri/=\r\nfor/resource/B to succeed.
