If a receiver\nunderstand the received XHTML document, it should also understand the\npurpose of each link (&lt;script&gt;,&lt;img&gt;) within the document and what it\ncan do next (e.g. to retrieve scripts, images).\n\nIf that&#39;s true, to traverse an application state, a receiver may just\nneed a set of media-type modules, and dispatch a received document to\nthe appropriate module each time separately. If the module understand\nPurchaseOrder, it must know what it can do next, users may just\nconfigure it on decision making.\n\nI feel that it may be similar to how a web browser deal with different\nmedia type, only the decision making in web browser is by human. What\ndo you think?\n\nCheers,\n-- \nTeo Hui Ming\n\n"}}
