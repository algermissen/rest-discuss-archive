Me thinks Jeff is straying from the opacity &quot;axiom&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; IMO, the opacity axiom doesn&#39;t mean that URI can&#39;t have semantics in a\n&gt; &gt; particular application domain,\n&gt;\n&gt; It means just that.  As soon as you assign any meaning to a URI, then\n&gt; only those privy to that meaning are in on your little secrets (like\n&gt; appending &quot;/subs&quot; means &quot;subscribers to the URI before /subs&quot;).\n&gt; Interoperability means sacrificing private convention for public\n&gt; specification.  So you make the URI-to-URI relationship explicit with\n&gt; a statement, such as is done with an HTTP header or an RDF statement,\n&gt; etc..\n&gt;\nThat statement (the name and location of the information) is still a little\nsecret that only those in the know.\nHowever, it may be better to move that out of the URI, and also do something\nto ensure backward compatibility - like defining these as &#39;advisory&#39; and\noptional. These turns the http response into a multi-link (or something -\nPaul, help me out here) with named references to interesting sub-properities\nof the resource. If those sub-properties are addressable, they are also\nprobably subscribable. So a DAV Properties: specified URI should be\nlistenable for just property (not content) changes.\n\nIf an HTTP WATCH method were to be used, would OPTIONS return that fact?\nDoes it operate per resource? (ignoring the extra requests to figure stuff\nout)\n\n\n\n\n"}}
