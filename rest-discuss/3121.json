Struts heavily uses the\n&gt; RequestDispatcher servlet api to internally forward requests to different\n&gt; components. In and of itself that&#39;s not a bad thing, but struts uses it to\n&gt; such a degree that the &quot;URL&quot; of a given page and the contents of that page\n&gt; may have no relation to one another. It also seems to encourage developers\n&gt; to use the HttpSession object to store conversational state, which is\n&gt; problematic from a REST point of view.\n\nAnd in some cases, from the point of view of a browser&#39;s back button.\n\n\n&gt; Fixing struts to be RESTful would require a serious amount of work, and I\n&gt; guess I doubt that the developers could be convinced that it would be a\n&gt; worthwhile investment. (which is very much too bad, since struts seems to\n&gt; be very popular as a webapp infrastructure.)\n\nThe core problem with these frameworks (and their reason for being) \nis session management. In REST/OO terms the session is the \nresource/object the business and thus the webapp developers really \ncare about. However smearing that resource across a web site and a \nbrowser (cookies, session ids in urls) makes for highly messy \nsoftware. Rather than remove this problem, webapp frameworks paint \nabstractions on top of it. There must be a dozen other frameworks in \nJava-land doing the same job in much the same way.\n\nAnd even if you did refactor struts to do a better job of sessions, \nthey&#39;re managing sessions the way they do in large part because web \nbrowsers are they way they are. Realistically, you&#39;d have to fix the \nbrowsers too.\n\nAny useful REST toolkit is going to look like a webapp framework \nthat lets developers manage session state over HTTP in a sane way.\n\nBill de h�ra\n\n\n"}}
