Or is that something that is not usually\n&gt;&gt; done within these specifications?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Bill\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\nSubbu,\nThe REST thesis is a little confusing on the point of whether headers are\npart of the &quot;representation&quot;. Please refer to table 5-1 which provides an\nexample for each type of data element:\n\nresource =&gt; the intended conceptual target of a hypertext reference\nresource identifier =&gt; URL, URN\nrepresentation =&gt; HTML document, JPEG image\nrepresentation metadata =&gt; media type, last-modified time\nresource metadata =&gt; source link, alternates, vary\ncontrol data =&gt; if-modified-since, cache-control\n\nThis implies that headers are resource/represention metadata or control\ndata. I would say that the link header falls into the resource metadata\nbucket. But then section 5.2.1.2 goes on to say that:\n\nA representation is a sequence of bytes, plus representation metadata to\ndescribe those bytes. Other commonly used but less precise names for a\nrepresentation include: document, file, and HTTP message entity, instance,\nor variant.\n\nA representation consists of data, metadata describing the data, and, on\noccasion, metadata to describe the metadata (usually for the purpose of\nverifying message integrity). Metadata is in the form of name-value pairs,\nwhere the name corresponds to a standard that defines the value&#39;s structure\nand semantics. Response messages may include both representation metadata\nand resource metadata: information about the resource that is not specific\nto the supplied representation.\nIt seems that the term &quot;representation&quot; is used to refer to both the HTTP\nmessage body as well as a the combination of body and headers. So it&#39;s not\ncompletely clear what sense of representation is intended by statements in\nsection 5.3.3 such as:\nThe model application is therefore an engine that moves from one state to\nthe next by examining and choosing from among the alternative state\ntransitions in the current set of representations.\n (I&#39;m not sure if there are well know writings on this by Roy or others that\nclarify this though.)\n\nThat said, I actually agree with you that links can reside in the headers,\ni.e. that the broader sense of &quot;representation&quot; applies. But I don&#39;t think\nthat all parts of the representation are equal. Specifically, headers, are\ntied to the protocol while the document/body is not. I highlighted this key\ndifferentiator in my previous post. So some consideration should be given as\nto what part of the representation contains specific pieces of information.\n\nYou certainly must use link headers if (for whatever reason) you are using a\nrepresentation format that does not support links (e.g. an image file). I\nalso agree with the notion that link headers can reiterate links in the body\nto inform intermediaries that don&#39;t understand the body format. The issue\nunder debate is whether links in headers or the body should be preferred\nwhen (a) the format being used supports linking and (b) a new format is\nbeing designed. You can obviously put them in both places, but if you have\nto put them in one place, which one should it be?\n\nFrom what you say above, my guess is that for (a) it&#39;s the body -- if you\nare using a format like Atom or HTML or another format where links are\nwell-defined you should use that mechanism. This ensures that you are not\ndependent on HTTP to drive the application state machine.\n\nFor (b), what is your position? Are you saying that the link header should\nbe preferred because it&#39;s already well-defined? Following that logic leads\nto the conclusion that all new hypermedia formats should defer linking to\nthe link header, which seems strange. Are you saying that you should use\nboth, to support clients/intermediaries that don&#39;t yet understand your new\nformat? If that is the case, then I think this is reasonable to the extent\nit can be achieved (links that don&#39;t apply to the whole body may be hard to\nrepresent in the headers).\n\nFinally, what exactly do you mean by &quot;application-specific&quot; formats? Do you\nmean something like a JSON data serialization of an application-specific\ndata type?
