I really can&#39;t imagine MS, Sun and IBM accepting\n&gt; &gt; that the spec stack now built on top of SOAP should be unwound.\n&gt;\n&gt; What makes you think they have a choice?\n&gt;\n&gt; If you look at the MS story, they are embracing it, admittedly by\n&gt; showing how WCF can be tweaked to handle it.\n&gt;\n&gt; As for IBM, well, they make lots of money off SOA, and so are fully\n&gt; committed to it as a concept. But at the same time. other players in\n&gt; the enteprise -MS, Sun, BEA, oracle- must see that money and want a\n&gt; slice of it. If IBM can retain it by sticking with SOA, then REST is a\n&gt; way to level the playing field, just a SOAP was a response to EJB.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n&quot;In an interview at IBM&#39;s Impact 2007 conference, Jerry Cuomo, CTO  \nfor IBM WebSphere, noted that he was recently named an IBM Fellow and  \nit is changing the way he thinks about how WebSphere fits into the  \nWeb services and service-oriented architecture (SOA) world. &quot;One of  \nthe things you&#39;re supposed to do as a Fellow is be thoughtful and not  \njust react,&quot; he said. That may explain why he did not react to  \nquestions about the more controversial aspects of Java technology in  \nthe same way as some others in the Java platform industry do. He is  \ntaking the long view beyond Java to innovations using REST and Web- \noriented architecture (WOA) or as he terms it &quot;SOA on the Web.&quot;\n\nThis is from http://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/qna/ \n0,289202,sid26_gci1257544,00.html?track=sy80\n\nStefan\n--\nStefan Tilkov, http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/\n\n\n\n\n&gt; Sun are working on WADL, which leaves IBM as the odd one out.
