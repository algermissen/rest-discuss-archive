All\n&gt; that I see is a request entity that may replace or create a new resource\n&gt; identified by the request-URI.\n\nThis has always bothered me too. Unless I misunderstand the concept of\n&#39;representation&#39; (which is perfectly possible--I haven&#39;t gotten around\nto reading Fielding&#39;s dissertation or other deep scholarly work on\nREST), the ability to PUT or POST a representation raises a serious\nissue which I have not seen addressed on this list.\n\nWhat if a client PUTs a representation of a type that is impractical to\ntransform to the type of the existing resource? Doesn&#39;t that effectively\ncripple the resource, upsetting the expectations of other clients? For\nexample, suppose your resource is an SVG graphic--one of the most\ninformation-rich image formats, and one that can be transformed to any\noutput format (known in this context as a representation, right?) you\nlike. So your server might make available JPEG, PNG, and EPS\nrepresentations of the image. Outbound, there&#39;s no problem. But now\nsuppose somebody wants to PUT a JPEG to the URI? If you allow the put,\nthen your information-rich SVG image is now degraded to a dumb JPEG (I&#39;m\ntalking about what happens in the real world, not the MIT Media Lab),\nwhich not only contains less information than the old resource, but may\nbe impractical to transform to some of the representation types that are\nsupposed to be available.\n\nSo do you disallow certain types of representations from being PUT or \nPOSTed? That certainly seems like a practical response to the problem.\nBut I would think that in a very large proportion of cases, you&#39;d have\nto prohibit any type but the original type of the resource--in which\ncase the distinction between resource and representation seems rather\nacademic.\n\nOr am I just confused?\n\n-- \nMatt Gushee\nEnglewood, Colorado, USA\nmgushee@...\nhttp://www.havenrock.com/\n\n"}}
