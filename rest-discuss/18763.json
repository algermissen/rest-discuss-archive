It will help me to clarify two littl=\r\ne\nmisconceptions (that even after 4 revisions to the article&#39;s text,\nalmost=\r\n rewriting it, still prevail):\n\n1. The model is not to disqualify anything!=\r\n As I said, a level 1 still\nprovides support for REST even if the developer=\r\n needs to write or use\nother frameworks to complete his job. Nor it is sayi=\r\nng that level 4 or 5\nis the most efficient. What we are depicting here is a=\r\nll the support a\nframework can offer. They ARE ALL REST frameworks, but som=\r\ne offer more\nsupport than others, and some offer support in different ways.=\r\n\n\n2. Yes, I Glen also commented against having the client part included,\nev=\r\nen after the discussion in this same list about the client being part\nof th=\r\ne REST system or not. Truth is that we cannot simply say the client\npart is=\r\n not part of REST and that is why some frameworks are actually\noffering cli=\r\nent support (yes, far more that just MS). In M2M scenarios,\none server can =\r\nactually be client of another server. The last REST\nsubstyle is the layered=\r\n one, meaning we can have several layers of\nclient-server and they should f=\r\nollow the same rules. Now, we are not\nasking for a client and server implem=\r\nentation. We are asking for support\non development. That is a little differ=\r\nent.\n\nFinally, as it has been discussed before, we can have two different\nd=\r\nevelopers. Glen mentioned the case of the server being implemented in\none p=\r\narticular language/platform, and then the framework supporting all\nthe othe=\r\nr languages out there fot the client part? Makes no sense and he\nis right. =\r\nBut if we have two developers, one creating the server with\none framework, =\r\nand the other one creating the client, we cannot FORCE\nthe client developer=\r\n to use the server framework, that is against REST\nidea. But then we cannot=\r\n doom the client guy to write all HTTP\ninteractions and conneg from scratch=\r\n everytime either! If we have a\nframework that help us with the client part=\r\n, great!. Nobody is saying we\nneed the same framework!\n\nNow think of me cre=\r\nating a server that needs to consume other REST\ninterface in another server=\r\n I&#39;m not creating. I can use two frameworks,\nor use one that allows me to c=\r\nreate the server and also connect to the\nother server.\n\nWhat I&#39;m trying to =\r\nsay is client is an important part, and we cannot\nleft it out just to allow=\r\n all the frameworks out there to be level 5.\n\nThe client part is controvers=\r\nial, I know, but we have to treat it\nsomewhere. Any ideas of improvements, =\r\nbeyond just kicking it out?\n\nThanks.\n\nWilliam Martinez.\n--- In rest-discuss=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, Sebastien Lambla &lt;seb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d highly disagree=\r\n that a fx to be efficient ought to have a client\npart. There are many http=\r\n-friendly client frameworks out there, why\nwouldn&#39;t combining them with a s=\r\nerver implementation be enough?\n&gt;\n&gt; I mean asking for both client and serve=\r\nr implementations feels like\nit&#39;s going in the complete opposite direction =\r\nto the whole point of http\nas an application, so the contract is shared rat=\r\nher than the\nimplementation?\n&gt;\n&gt; Plus in my neck on the wood it would disqu=\r\nalify everybody bar the\nMicrosoft implementation, or maybe servicestack if =\r\nthey do have a client\n(not sure).\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
