Indeed it would be very interesting to know\n&gt; why, considering the exposure and usage they have at web scale, why\n&gt; they still remain unregistered.\n&gt; \n&gt; To hazard a guess myself, if you first consider application/rss+xml\n&gt; [1] it aims to group all versions of RSS under a common media type,\n&gt; however some of those versions are actually application/rdf+xml with\n&gt; an ontology, others are application/xml with a doctype and still\n&gt; others are simply XML which probably does warrant it&#39;s own media type \n&gt; registration (specifically versions 2.0+). RSS has a been a PITA for \n&gt; years and afaik every RDF parser has to incorporate a sniffing\n&gt; algorithm (on the first 512 bytes) to figure out which version it is,\n&gt; ironically, registered or not, it does break the self descriptive\n&gt; messaging constraint (afaict) and certainly has had wide spread\n&gt; deployment problems to this day.\n&gt; \n\nRight -- the identifier doesn&#39;t begin to declare an explicit processing\nmodel, the content must still be introspected, so it won&#39;t be self-\ndescriptive even if it is registered, but I&#39;m not sure this is why it\nhasn&#39;t been approved -- it&#39;s an application to the standards tree which\nrefers to a whole slew of specs from rssboard.org, which is not an\nIANA-sanctioned standards body where the standards tree is concerned.\nI&#39;m sure there&#39;s a procedure for applying for recognition, for rssboard\nand Python WG, but I&#39;m darned if I can find it.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; As for application/opensearchdescription+xml, well simply &quot;This type\n&gt; is pending IANA registration.&quot; and should registration actually\n&gt; happen, then I guess this would be a good example of making a new\n&gt; media type, proving it&#39;s worth, and then getting registered and\n&gt; explain why there is scope for unregistered types to be used on the\n&gt; web (although discouraged), if it was a MUST use IANA registered\n&gt; types then this kind of evolution in the registry simply wouldn&#39;t\n&gt; happen.\n&gt; \n\nAt least this uses the right process, i.e. there&#39;s an RFC, so a\nstandards-tree identifier for opensearch does at least stand a chance\nat being registered.  But, what happens if it&#39;s rejected?  Will it ever\nbe self-descriptive?  Isn&#39;t that a risk to be aware of?  The possibility\nof your identifier being rejected *has* to be part of your decision-\nmaking process when considering re-use vs. minting new.\n\nI&#39;ve been trying to avoid stating my position as REST says you MUST use\nIANA-registered types, because that would preclude evolution of new\ntypes, which is exactly what the mechanism of a registry is intended to\nallow.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve misstated that, so to borrow a phrase from Obama,\n&quot;let me be clear:&quot;  REST says identifiers MUST be IANA-registered on the\nWeb in order to be self-descriptive (Roy says self-descriptive\n=registered, and it&#39;s a fact that IANA is the only registry for the\nWeb).\n\nThis enforces the agreement to use a specified registry of defined\nidentifiers, a key feature of any network-based API.  I&#39;ve been trying\nto oppose the notion that it is not necessary to even consider\nIANA-registering newly-minted identifiers, but still OK to call them\nself-descriptive.  Pending approval, application/opensearchdescription\n+xml doesn&#39;t meet the constraint.  After approval, it does.\n\nThis may seem like a rigid, PITA position, but I see it as necessary to\npromote re-use.  Is it *really* worth the tradeoff to define a new\nmedia type if, after all that trouble and effort, IANA rejects your\nidentifier for one reason or another?  Compared to using something\nthat&#39;s already ubiquitous, even if it isn&#39;t the most-efficient choice?\n\nIs it *really* possible to define a new media type with its own\nprocessing model over morning coffee?  Or is that evidence in and of\nitself that it&#39;s application-specific?  Every useful, standardized type\nI can think of took _years_ to develop, and I don&#39;t see a problem with\nrecognizing this reality by promoting the orderly, considered evolution\nof new media types as opposed to an ad-hoc free-for-all (which wouldn&#39;t\nrequire a registry to encourage).\n\nIOW, I think the IANA registry is *supposed* to discourage the willy-\nnilly minting of new identifiers.  But I&#39;m also willing to entertain\nthe notion that it&#39;s too strict, to the point of stifling innovation.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
