Data is either on the Internet or it isn&#39;t. If there \nis some configuration of message bits that will get the data, then you \nneed to make sure your cracker can&#39;t send you those bits (i.e. use \npasswords). What does it matter whether you use a standardized \naddressing mechanism (URIs) versus a non-standard one? I&#39;ve argued in \nthe past (and would rather not do it again) that using a standarized \nmechanism is actually better because your infrastructure understands \nwhat is going on better and can provide more support (e.g. ACLs on \nresource types).\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
