wrote:\n&gt; Mike,\n&gt;\n&gt; I think we should differentiate between the d=\r\nata (model?) layer and the\n&gt; presentation layer in this discussion. The dif=\r\nference between LO and LE in\n&gt; this instance really just matters if a human=\r\n being is looking at a rendered\n&gt; representation of the data (should the im=\r\nage be rendered or not?). Or do I\n&gt; misunderstand you in this regard?\n\nwhil=\r\ne i used HTML in some examples, the idea of transclusion and\nnavigation are=\r\n not limited to visual affordances. i cited x:include as\none example and co=\r\nuld have using LINK, X:LINK, etc. in others. in an\nM2M scenario i have in m=\r\nind (a real life example, btw), a set of\nmachines make requests of a server=\r\n in order to get &quot;work&quot; to complete\n(in this case documents and/or images t=\r\no process in various ways as\nindicated by data returned by the servers). th=\r\nese bots recognize (in\none case) affordances that instruct the client to ga=\r\nther other data\nfrom other locations in order to complete a single document=\r\n that is to\nbe sent to the server for additional work. in another case, the=\r\n client\nrecognizes affordances that instruct the client to go evaluate the\n=\r\ncurrent state of the resource, select optimal values and submit them\nto one=\r\n or more servers for additional processing. and so forth.\n\nin the example i=\r\n offer here, the number and type of affordance varies\nper request, the numb=\r\ner of varible arguments (i.e. members of\ntemplates/forms) can vary, too. in=\r\n some cases idempotent requests are\nappropriate, in others non-idempotent r=\r\nequests are the &quot;correct&quot;\nchoice. most of the requests are &quot;safe&quot;, but some=\r\n are not. this\ninformation appears in the messages clients receive.\n\nit&#39;s t=\r\nheir job to recognize, parse, evaluate, and activate until\nreaching a goal =\r\n(usually that goal is &quot;all works is done, thanks&quot;)\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - omitting _prope=\r\nrties_ of the message? not following you here. maybe\n&gt;&gt; an example you can =\r\npoint to would clear this up for me.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think what Peter meant here was =\r\nthat just as in, e.g., HTML you could\n&gt; ommit certain RDF properties in the=\r\n message if you don&#39;t want that a client\n&gt; follows/knows those URIs. It&#39;s s=\r\nimilar to removing an &lt;a&gt; from an HTML\n&gt; representation if you wanna remove=\r\n that state transition.\n&gt;\n&gt; Simple example in pseudo-code\n&gt;\n&gt; {\n&gt; =A0&quot;@type=\r\n&quot;: &quot;order&quot;,\n&gt; =A0&quot;@id&quot;: &quot;/orders/13574&quot;,\n&gt; =A0&quot;total&quot;: 150.69,\n&gt; =A0&quot;paymen=\r\nt&quot;: &quot;/payment/49840&quot;\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; If you would omit the payment property the cli=\r\nent wouldn&#39;t be able to follow\n&gt; that link, which is similar to omitting an=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0&lt;a href=3D&quot;/payment/49840&quot; rel=3D&quot;payment&quot;&gt;Payment&lt;/a&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; from an =\r\nHTML representation.\n\nif i understand you, you are making a case for repres=\r\nentations that\nindicate variance in what selections clients have; what acti=\r\non they\ncan take. this _seems_ to be at odds w/ what peter indicated to me =\r\nin\nhis reply.\n&lt;snip&gt;We have the uniform interface so any method may be call=\r\ned on any\nresource.&lt;/snip&gt;\ndo you think i am mis-representing peter&#39;s reply=\r\n here?\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - seems you assume M2M here in several of your replies. is i=\r\nt your POV\n&gt;&gt; that RDF is only to be used in M2M scenarios? or do you mean =\r\nto say\n&gt;&gt; that some of the affordances is describe have no value in M2M cas=\r\nes?\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t know about Peter&#39;s POV but mine is that RDF has a great pot=\r\nential to\n&gt; allow both, M2M and H2M, much better than, e.g., HTML where the=\r\n link\n&gt; relations are just described in a human readable fashion. We are fa=\r\nr away\n&gt; from that but since in RDF everything is machine processable a cli=\r\nent could\n&gt; &quot;learn&quot; (or maybe better infer) the meaning of new link relatio=\r\nns based on\n&gt; his already existing knowledge for instance.\n\nlet&#39;s steer cle=\r\nar of &quot;meaning&quot; and &quot;learn&quot; here. i am not making any\nclaims or requirement=\r\ns of this type.  what i have stated to this point\nis that there are two typ=\r\nes of _information_ i am interested in\nincluding in messages sent from serv=\r\ner to client: protocol-level\ninformation and domain-specific information. I=\r\n have given examples of\nprotocol-level information that i can include in me=\r\nssage designs. i\nhave asserted that i am unable to clearly indicate that sa=\r\nme level of\nprotocol information when using RDF-based media types. am i inc=\r\norrect?\n\nto be clear, i am not saying RDF-based media types MUST or SHOULD\n=\r\ncarry that information, just that i have yet to see examples of this\nlevel =\r\nof information in RDF-based media type messages.\n\ni also concede that you a=\r\nnd Peter question whether the protocol-level\ninformation i have identified =\r\nis _needed_ in messages from servers.\nPeter states:\n&quot;I am not sure why prot=\r\nocol method is important. &quot;\nand\n&quot;Why would a media type need to encode [ide=\r\nmpotency] information?&quot;\n\nAnd you say:\n&quot;The difference between LO and LE ...=\r\n just matters if a human being is\nlooking at a rendered representation of t=\r\nhe data &quot;\nand\n&quot;[templates are] part of the presentational logic which is un=\r\nimportant\nin M2M scenarios.&quot;\n\nhave i mis-quoted here or taken these out of =\r\ncontext as to abuse their intent?\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - IME, transclusion is not exclu=\r\nsively a H2M (human-to-machine)\n&gt;&gt; affordance, i use &quot;x:include&quot; quite ofte=\r\nn in M2M cases\n&gt;\n&gt; Hmm... Could you elaborate a bit on this? Why don&#39;t you =\r\nsimply include it,\n&gt; i.e., merge it into the response instead of just linki=\r\nng to it?\n\ni think the scenario i cited at the top of this reply answers to=\r\n this point.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - templates (URI or body) are of mixed value in M2M, I=\r\nME. as long as\n&gt;&gt; the vocab is stable and the templates are used to control=\r\n timing and\n&gt;&gt; flow, this has worked well for me. of course H2M templates a=\r\nre much\n&gt;&gt; easier to support since the selector is not in the code, but in =\r\nthe\n&gt;&gt; head of the human.\n&gt;\n&gt; Again, IMHO this is part of the presentationa=\r\nl logic which is unimportant in\n&gt; M2M scenarios. As long as a M2M client is=\r\n able to understand the template&#39;s\n&gt; variables and fill them with concrete =\r\nvalues there isn&#39;t really any\n&gt; difference to a form, right?\n\nin the implem=\r\nentations i create, not all possible variables are\nacceptable in call cases=\r\n, even if all variables are _known_\nbeforehand. in my work clients look in =\r\nthe message to see which of the\nclient&#39;s known variables are valid for this=\r\n instance and (in some\ncases) which are required/optional. there is even at=\r\n least one case\nwhere variables are group--dependent (if you supply x you M=\r\nUST supply\nx, etc.). these are time/instance dependent cases.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; i am =\r\nwriting apps where clients are expected to recognize, parse, and\n&gt;&gt; (in som=\r\ne cases) render and/or activate affordances in responses. When i\n&gt;&gt; impleme=\r\nnt those apps, RDF is not something i find fits the bill; that&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; all.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; But you need to program those client apps to look for specific\n&gt; links/fo=\r\nrms/affordances, right? So why do you think this is any different?\n&gt; The on=\r\nly difference I see is that instead of having just a human readable\n&gt; docum=\r\nentation you make (parts of) it also machine-processable.\n\ni program client=\r\ns as state machines to be able to recognize\naffordances and respond to them=\r\n. some are quitre simple (immutable\nlinks for navigation). others are more =\r\ninvolved (mutable templates for\ncompleting request bodies, URI templates, c=\r\nhoices of one or more &quot;next\nsteps&quot; evaulated against a goal or other workfl=\r\now of the client,\netc.).\n\nthe work i do right now is not a fixed set of  ac=\r\ntions w/ static,\npre-defined parameters. knowing a set of static state tran=\r\nsitions\nahead of time is insufficient for this work. instead clients need t=\r\no\nbe prepared to respond to representations returned by the server.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Bu=\r\nt I agree, there is a need for a small and simple vocabulary to describe\n&gt; =\r\nbasic control flows - something I planned to work on rather sooner than\n&gt; l=\r\nater.\n\ni look forward to hearing more on this.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Markus Lanthal=\r\ner\n&gt; @markuslanthaler\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Yahoo!
