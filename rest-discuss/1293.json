I don&#39;t claim to be a REST wizard, but\n&gt; I&#39;ve been following this discussion for 3 months, and I haven&#39;t\n&gt; known anyone to suggest such a thing. In fact, one of the core\n&gt; principles of REST as I understand it is that the implementation \n&gt; of a REST resource is opaque to the client, which implies that \n&gt; it would be quite appropriate to generate a representation \n&gt; using any of the above technologies.\n\nASP.NET webforms for one always use POST regardless of whether its apropriate.\n\nCheers\nSimon\n\n\n"}}
