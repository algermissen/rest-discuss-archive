ARR!\n\nI think that is one of the key problems with REST, and why so many urban\nlegend have grown up to surround it.  Without an authoritative document that\nexplains REST in work-a-day developer terms in addition to the rigorous\nlanguage required by such authoritative documents, untold hours are wasted\nin debate and by people simply trying to grok it all. Publishing such a\ndocument as an RFC or the equivalent for the IETF, with significant examples\nwould go a long way to avoid so much needless thrashing. Especially when you\nconsider how passionate many people on this list are in their beliefs that\nstrict adherence to the tenents of REST are essential.\n\nSo I guess I&#39;m calling the question! Can we create an RFC, or some other\nauthoritative document that defines REST written in a language\nunderstandable by those not accustomed to reading and interpreting\nspecifications?\n\n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org/\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Nic James Ferrier [mailto:nferrier@...] \nSent: Tuesday, November 07, 2006 6:59 AM\nTo: Mike Schinkel\nCc: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [rest-discuss] RFC for REST?\n\n&quot;Mike Schinkel&quot; &lt;mikeschinkel@...&gt; writes:\n\n&gt; I&#39;m relatively new to studying REST and related topics on a *rigorous* \n&gt; basis, so forgive me if I&#39;m asking foolish questions.\n&gt;  \n&gt; But I&#39;m curious; is there an RFC or some other &quot;standard&quot; that defines \n&gt; REST, or is the only authoritative reference Roy&#39;s dissertation?\n\nREST is like the prirate code; it&#39;s more like guidlines than your actual\nrules...
