It implies that\n&gt;there is a variant that a client *could* request, but the 404/410 status\n&gt;implies there isn&#39;t any.\n&gt;\n\nThat&#39;s what I thought at first, too.  But I took another read of REST and \nRFC 2616 and changed my mind:\n\n&quot;Response messages may include both representation metadata and resource \nmetadata: information about the resource that is not specific to the \nsupplied representation... Depending on the message control data, a \ngiven representation may indicate... the value of some other resource... \n[like] a representation of some error condition for a response.&quot; (5.2.1.2)\n\nI think an ETag is representation metadata, not resource metadata.  I see \nnothing in RFC 2616 to support caching any 4xx response, whereas 301 says \nit MAY be cached and 307 says it MUST NOT be cached.  But you can send a \nno-cache directive and an ETag with any 4xx error containing an entity \nbody, and the ETag will only pertain to (one variant of) that \nrepresentation of an error condition:\n\n&quot;Entity tags are used for comparing two or more entities from the same \nrequested resource...  An entity tag MUST be unique across all versions \nof all entities associated with a particular resource. A given entity tag value MAY be used for entities obtained by requests on different URIs.&quot;\n(RFC 2616, 3.11)\n\nI interpret this as saying that I can set ETag: &quot;410Gone&quot; for any 410 \nresponse on my server (the entity body is the same every time).  Any \nresource responding 410 Gone contains this *representation metadata* \nwhich only implies that there is no other representation available as \na response from that resource with the same ETag -- and there isn&#39;t.  I \ndon&#39;t see where that implies there are any variants beyond possibly a \ndifferent custom 410 message than I was using the day before, because \nthe ETag is specific to the entity body of the representation of the \nerror condition.  I won&#39;t be setting an ETag on the 404 response.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;...I&#39;d make that more specific, such as 409 or 403...\n&gt;\n\nActually, I think an unconditional DELETE on a 410 Gone should just \nrespond 410 Gone, just like any DELETE attempt on a 404 response will \njust respond 404.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
