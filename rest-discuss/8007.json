But I also want people to be able to\n&gt;&gt; look at the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; list of articles at /articles based on topic. There was I think a\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; suggestion on this list to put the list of articles that are just\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about Java at:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; /articles/java\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Or you could use &quot;/topics/java&quot;, which makes more sense to me.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Trouble with that is it isn&#39;t specific to articles. We also\n&gt;&gt; have other categories, such as news. And we want a specific\n&gt;&gt; URL for letting people browse Java news and a different one\n&gt;&gt; for Java articles.\n&gt;\n&gt; \t/articles/\n&gt; \t/topics/\n&gt; \t/news/\n&gt;\nMy requirements are that articles about Java and news about Java need  \ntwo different URLs. /topics/java is one URL. At /topics/java I&#39;d  \nexpect to see any kind of content about Java, but that is not a  \nrequirement.\n\n&gt;&gt; Also, I want to have something useful at\n&gt;&gt; each subpath. I could put a list of topics at:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; /topics\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; but that&#39;s not really deserving of its own page.\n&gt;\n&gt; Why not?  It should list the topics available to be covered.\n&gt;\nActually it would probably be tags, or just a search box. I lost  \nconfidence in listing topics a priori that content would fall into.  \nSure, you could have such a page, but if I weren&#39;t forced to do it by  \nthe information architecture I wouldn&#39;t give this a page. I don&#39;t  \nhave one now and don&#39;t plan to have one in the future.\n\n&gt;&gt; Also, I want to offer these lists sorted alphabetically and by\n&gt;&gt; reverse pub date. So going in this direction I&#39;d need to do\n&gt;&gt; something\n&gt;&gt; like:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; /alpha/topics/java\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; or\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; /topics/alpha/java\n&gt;&gt; /topics/pubdate/java\n&gt;\n&gt; Sorting is not an entity, it is a layout/formatting directive. IOW, it\n&gt; doesn&#39;t change the content, only it&#39;s presentation. So in a path is  \n&gt; should\n&gt; be at the end, not the beginning, or in a param:\n&gt;\n&gt; \t/topics/java/alpha\n&gt; \t/topics/java?sort=alpha\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d probably prefer the latter.\n&gt;\nWell that was the point of my response. Your original question was  \nwhy does one need query parameters.\n\n\n&gt;&gt; And what would you put at\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; /alpha\n&gt;\n&gt; Nothing.\n\nWhich was also my point.\n\n&gt;&gt; when you have articles about Java listed at /articles?t=java,\n&gt;&gt; people can kind of get the idea from the URl that this is a list of\n&gt;&gt; articles rather than a list of news items.\n&gt;\n&gt; But they can get the same idea if you segment as:\n&gt;\n&gt; \t/articles/\n&gt; \t/news/\n&gt;\nI&#39;m not sure if you mean /topics/articles here or /articles. If you  \nsay /topics/articles I think it is pretty clear. But I still feel / \ntopics itself is artificial. /articles is all articles. /news is all  \nnews. If you want to look at news about Java and articles about Java,  \nit is at:\n\n/articles?t=java\n/news?t=java\n\nThe query parameters yield a &quot;view&quot; of part of the concept to the  \nleft of the question mark, in this case, the subset of content items  \nthat fall under the &quot;Java&quot; category.\n\nWhat I&#39;m claiming is that yes, you potentially could try to force  \neverything into path fields (between the slashes), but named  \nparameters are often a better fit. You can leave a named query params  \ncompletely out to say it is at its default value, whereas using a  \npath field for everything would require you to actually put a default  \ncharacter in the URL, because you need something in each position  \n(unless what you want to leave out is at the end). Also, I think it  \nwould be easier to add new parameters later than new path fields,  \nbecause when you try and put something that fits better as a query  \ninto the path, it needs to go in the beginning. So if you didn&#39;t  \nthink of it initially, you can&#39;t put it in without breaking existing  \nlinks, because path params are parsed by position, not by name.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nPresident\nArtima, Inc.\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n&gt; -- \n&gt; -Mike Schinkel\n&gt; http://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\n&gt; http://www.welldesignedurls.org\n&gt; http://atlanta-web.org - http://t.oolicio.us\n&gt; &quot;It never ceases to amaze how many people will proactively debate away\n&gt; attempts to improve the web...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
