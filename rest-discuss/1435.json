The resource is the car, and it has\nan identifier;\n  http://www.mnot.net/2000/vw/golf/VIN1234567\nHow do I roll down the window? I could POST to the car with a body\ncontaining something like\n  part=leftwindow&action=rolldown\nor I could expose a subresource\n  http://www.mnot.net/2000/vw/golf/VIN1234567/window-left/\nto POST a action=rolldown to.\nThen again, I could expose\n  http://www.mnot.net/2000/vw/golf/VIN1234567/window/left/\nand do the same; this would allow me to perform actions on all of the\nwindows (such as &quot;clean&quot;) by specifying &quot;window&quot;, whilst still preserving\nthe subresource relationship between &quot;window&quot; and &quot;left&quot;.\nBeing more specific, I could expose the position of the window as a\nresource;\n  http://www.mnot.net/2000/vw/golf/VIN1234567/window/left/position\nwhich is quite RESTful.\nNow, what if I wanted to wash only part of the window, say the inside?\n\nWait a minute, you say; if we reduce this argment to the absurd, every\natom (and atomic particle) in the window is potentially a resource. I am\nvery much reminded of my first year philosophy teacher; he introduced\nhimself to the class by asking us what a chair was. We replied, after some\nhesitation, &quot;that&quot;, accompanied by some pointing. Without repeating the\nprogression above, we got down to the point where an atom was in an\nindeterminate state based on whether the chair was touching the floor or\nnot.\n\nBack to SOAP (and hopefully a bit closer to reality), it&#39;s up to you as to\nwhat you expose in the URI interface. If you want it to be interoperable\nwith applications that need to reference different subresources, that\nwould indicate the use of separate URIs. You can do this in any Web\nServices environment; the only question is how much pain you have to put\nup with to give different services different URIs. If you&#39;re happy with\nthe services that have to do with a car being available on the &#39;car&#39; URI,\nso be it; that&#39;s your choice, and it&#39;s just as much on the Web as the\nother ones.\n\n\n* This is the subject of some debate elsewhere, but let&#39;s assume it&#39;s true\n;)\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Roger L. Costello&quot; &lt;costello@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;; &lt;costello@...&gt;\nSent: Friday, June 07, 2002 4:20 AM\nSubject: [rest-discuss] With SOAP the URI does not directly reference the\nresource, right?\n\n\n&gt; I am having a debate with a colleague.  I am arguing that when SOAP is\n&gt; used you POST to the SOAP server, and it then looks inside the SOAP\n&gt; message to determine which application to delegate to.  Thus, when you\n&gt; invoke a Web service the URI is to the SOAP server, not to the target\n&gt; application (i.e., resource).  For example, if a company has deployed\n&gt; three Web services then despite which Web service a client wishes to\n&gt; invoke, the URI will always be the same, for example:\n&gt;\n&gt;    http://www.parts-depot.com/soap/server\n&gt;\n&gt; What differs, of course, is the contents of the SOAP message.  I argue\n&gt; that this hiding of the identity of the target resource in the SOAP\n&gt; message is a disadvantage of SOAP (one of the key disadvantages of\n&gt; SOAP).\n&gt;\n&gt; My colleague argues that this is not true.  He says that a client can\n&gt; provide the URI directly to the target Web service (resource), for\n&gt; example:\n&gt;\n&gt;    http://www.parts-depot.com/parts\n&gt;    http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/part/00345\n&gt;    http://www.parts-depot.com/parts/purchase-order\n&gt;\n&gt; He claims that he has done this using WebLogic. Here&#39;s a quote from him:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;We were able to have 2 web services on the same machines with different\n&gt; URI, using WebLogic.\n&gt;\n&gt; I haven&#39;t used WebLogic, so I can&#39;t verify his statement.\n&gt;\n&gt; Can someone settle this debate please?  /Roger\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
