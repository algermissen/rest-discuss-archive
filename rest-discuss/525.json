But if notification bodies are optional, then\n&gt; &gt; you don&#39;t need to accumulate a queue of update\n&gt; &gt; messages for the client.  You just need to send\n&gt; &gt; the last one.\n&gt;\n&gt; If the application has meaningful notification bodies then it might\n&gt; prefer to queue and retry.\n\nIt could always consolidate all the changes into\none message body, avoiding queuing.\n\n&gt; &gt; It is harder because then server implementations\n&gt; &gt; MUST know what their URI is.  I&#39;ve seen too many\n&gt; &gt; server environments where you don&#39;t.\n&gt;\n&gt; All I ask is that you know ONE of your URIs. i.e. that you can generate\n&gt; a URI for yourself.\n\nThe problem is that the URI you generate for\nyourself may be inaccessible by the client.\n\n&gt; &gt; Note in reading the spec. again I think the big\n&gt; &gt; gap is actually in acquiring the subscription\n&gt; &gt; resource!\n&gt;\n&gt; You don&#39;t need to get a subscription resource if you already know of a\n&gt; server that provides that service. The Subscription: URI is for when you\n&gt; DON&#39;T know of one and you DO want to ask the server whether it can do it\n&gt; for you.\n\nThe issue is that, as the spec stands, you can&#39;t\n(at the protocol level) correlate a subscription\nwith a resource unless that resource support it.\n\nI suppose that is ok.  It is just a little wierd.\nThere is no reason some subscription directory\npage can&#39;t provide URLs of various subscription\nresources.  However, if it does, I think it would\nbe nice if subcription resources identified\nthemselves in some way so that user-agents can\nhandle them in some automated way.\n\n&gt; &gt; For example, you might want a polling server to\n&gt; &gt; notify you of changes to a resource even if the\n&gt; &gt; underlying resource server is not implementing\n&gt; &gt; this protocol (and therefore doesn&#39;t send a\n&gt; &gt; Subscriptions: header).\n&gt;\n&gt; No problem. If you now how to generate a Subscriptions resource just by\n&gt; pasting together uris then you can do that.\n\n??? Can you explain?\nI think the answer above is that you just know\nout-of-band the resource to which the subscription\nrefers.\n\n&gt; &gt; Rather than having a resource issue a\n&gt; &gt; Subsriptions: header, it makes much more sense for\n&gt; &gt; a subscription to issue a &quot;location:&quot; header\n&gt; &gt; pointing to the underlying subscribed resource.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think this is an orthogonal issue. But yes, I do want subscription\n&gt; resources to be self-describing about what they are watching,  what\n&gt; their expiry policy is, etc. There will be standard headers for that\n&gt; stuff.\n\nok.\n\n-Alex-\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
