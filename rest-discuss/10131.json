But they neither could anyone else on the XLST\n&gt;  list give me any alternatives, and that included Michael Kay.\n\nYou *did* get lots of answers, and a lot of them pointed to your lack\nof understanding of what &lt;apply-templates /&gt; actually does and how the\ndeclarative nature of XSLT in fact favours it, or the automatic\ntemplates and why they&#39;re there. You couldn&#39;t understand why &lt;value-of\n/&gt; didn&#39;t do what &lt;apply-templates /&gt; do, and this was pointed out. I\nalso seem to recall that Michael Kay indeed gave you advice and\npointed to the same thing that Elliotte Rusty Harold points to now ;\nIf you want imperative programming, XSLT is not for you. Michael also\npointed out that perhaps XSLT 2.0 might be a better option for you\nbecause it can nanny you better.\n\n&gt;  Well I guess I was just unable to &quot;get&quot; the &quot;right&quot; way to do XSLT. And as\n&gt;  I tend to be a lot more technically advanced than the average person, even\n&gt;  more reason to argue against XSLT for mainstream use.\n\nWith XSLT comes a paradigm shift for most people who are expecting\nimperative programming. Sure, you *can* do it that way, and\n(unfortunately?) XSLT is flexible enough to allow you to do so, but\nthe universal principle of GIGO applies here just as anywhere else.\nJust like people struggle with RDF and Topic Maps for the first while\nto &quot;get it&quot; (or any ontology work, really), XSLT too has a &quot;get it&quot;\nthreshold (functional, declarative, node-tree based). Some never get\nit.\n\nMost people who complain about XSLT don&#39;t get what XSLT is or how it\nworks the best. I used to be one myself, not &quot;getting it&quot; and\ncomplaining. But then one day I got it (and really, it was a direct\ncause from getting XML on a deeper level), and now I can&#39;t go back to\ndealing with any markup the DOM/SAX/API way ; they&#39;re all so inelegant\nto me.\n\nIt&#39;s ok not to &quot;get it.&quot; There certainly isn&#39;t an automatic membership\nto a cool club if you do. In fact, it does the opposite ; it makes you\na member of that club of people who sometimes have to tell people that\ndon&#39;t get it that they, indeed, don&#39;t get it. :) And that that&#39;s ok.\n\nSo should we not promote XSLT for &quot;normal programmers&quot;? Sometimes this\nis true, sometimes it is not. We need to choose the right tool for the\nright job, and sometimes choosing a tool that&#39;s right for the\nprogrammer is also true. And then, learning something new ain&#39;t bad\neither. It all depends.\n\n&gt;  As I&#39;ve said repeatedly, I did my best to stick to the standard and only\n&gt; use  MS extensions when I could find no other ways.\n\nIt&#39;s not always about the standards themselves ; more often it&#39;s about\ngrokking a certain concept.\n\n&gt;  That said, please address how to handle this in XSLT 1.0 if MS&#39; extensions\n&gt;  are not the answer:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.mikeschinkel.com/blog/gettingpastthexslterrorexpressionmustevaluatetoanodeset/\n\nHandle what? There&#39;s nothing here to handle except your assumption\nthat doing so is a good thing, and there&#39;s a *lot* of design issues in\nsaying that. XSLT 1.0 either lets you create a variable with a\nnode-set (through @select) or a string (through anything else), and\nthis was done for very good reasons. Failing to accept the ground\nrules from which XSLT 1.0 came, use XSLT 2.0 which has some sligthly\ndifferent design concepts.\n\n\nAlex\n-- \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Project Wrangler, SOA, Information Alchemist, UX, RESTafarian, Topic Maps\n------------------------------------------ http://shelter.nu/blog/ --------\n\n"}}
