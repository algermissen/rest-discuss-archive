This is what I was thinking when I \n&gt; suggested that we create a full-blown distributed OOP development &gt; environment that supports REST intrinsically.\n\nIsn&#39;t the idea of REST that URIs identify &quot;resources&quot;, i.e., logical\nentities?  Whether the resource is implemented as an object or some\nother form is transparent.  Consequently, the implementation of the\nresource can change without impacting clients.  \n\nI don&#39;t really equate &quot;objects&quot; with &quot;logical entities&quot;.  There are many\nways to implement a logical entity without the use of objects, e.g., a\nlogical entitiy could be implemented simply as an XML document, or as\nthe results of a database query.  \n\nI see these two statements as being very different:\n\nObject-based:\n\nWe need a development environment where URL-addressability for any\n**object** is a built-in feature of the system. \n\nResource-based:\n\nWe need a development environment where URL-addressability for any\n**resource** is a built-in feature of the system.\n\nI agree with the later, but not the former.  /Roger\n\n\n"}}
