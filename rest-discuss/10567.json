In fact, most of my implementations use no &#39;file\nextension&#39; value for URIs.\n\nIn my implementation work, I have the server using the Accept header\nsent by the client to decide which representation (text/html,\napplication/json, application/pdf, etc.) to send to the client. As an\naside, the server knows the &#39;perferred&#39; representation and will send\nthat when the client has a &#39;vague&#39; Accept header (*/*).\n\nAm I going about this the wrong way?\n\nMikeA\n\n\nOn Mon, Mar 31, 2008 at 10:06 AM, Jan Algermissen\n&lt;algermissen1971@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi Stefan,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  On 31.03.2008, at 15:46, Stefan Tilkov wrote:\n&gt;  &gt; &quot;The issue of content-type negotiation within the realm of REST\n&gt;  &gt; architectures is one that comes up often, but seems to me Fielding has\n&gt;  &gt; been pretty consistent in saying that such negotiation is problematic\n&gt;  &gt; and usually not very RESTful.&quot;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; http://blogs.msdn.com/dotnetinterop/archive/2008/03/28/content-type-\n&gt;  &gt; negotiation-and-rest-and-how-wcf-fits-in.aspx\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; This seems all wrong to me, but maybe I&#39;m missing something?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  After taking a glance at it: I am not sure about the way he quotes\n&gt;  Roy or  XML vs JSON being mechanical etc. but I think it is generally\n&gt;  correct not to deliver different media types through the same\n&gt;  resource. If you have several, then publish a single URI that\n&gt;  redirects to media type specific ones based upon the Accept header.\n&gt;  That way every resource gets its own URI which gives the client more\n&gt;  control/possibilities.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Hmm...wonder how one would do this with an Atom entry&#39;s content,\n&gt;  where there can only be one content which also should have a media\n&gt;  type attribute set.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Jan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Stefan\n&gt;  &gt; --\n&gt;  &gt; Stefan Tilkov, http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Yahoo!
