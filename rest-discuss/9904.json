The server has access to the currently \nlogged in user (in php by way of the $_SERVER[&#39;PHP_AUTH_USER&#39;]). I had \nforgotten that.  So this is really sounding like a good solution...\n\n&gt; karen:\n&gt; yes, if you plan on creating resources that *depend* on the preference\n&gt; data, they will not bookmark well. however, the resource that responds\n&gt; to the /user/current/ request can also return anonymous information.\n&gt; this would make the pages &#39;work&#39; for bookmarked content, but possibly\n&gt; contain different data.\n&gt;\n\nIn my use case, the resource certainly does NOT depend on the preference \ndata.  The /user/current/ data simply adds a few links to the page that \nthis particular use might want/be authorized to follow.\n\n-peter\n\n&gt; for example, if i try to bookmark  my home page (that includes\n&gt; user/current/ data via ajax) and share that with pals (&quot;look at what&#39;s\n&gt; in my shopping cart!&quot;). but that&#39;s the same if i tried to share a\n&gt; direct link to my cart with my pals, too.\n&gt;\n&gt; the key is to be sure to *not* do what JoAnn.com does - make *public\n&gt; content* dependent on the current user, right?\n&gt;\n&gt; mca\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On 12/2/07, Karen &lt;karen.cravens@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; On 12/2/07, mike amundsen &lt;mamund@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for example an ajax request to the /user/current/ resource could\n&gt;&gt;&gt; return a simple text/plain object (&quot;my-name&quot;). now the client can use\n&gt;&gt;&gt; this data to construct other URI to get personalized data:  GET\n&gt;&gt;&gt; /users/{userid}/preferences\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; However, now you&#39;ve created a system where users cannot pass a\n&gt;&gt; bookmark to someone else.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; JoAnn.com, a pretty major player in the sewing/craft industry, hands\n&gt;&gt; out URLs that include a session ID.
