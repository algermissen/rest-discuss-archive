A couple of bits of feedback:\n\n&gt; Given this equipment, we can place Jeff&#39;s comments about authentication and\n&gt; expiration.  Expiration is the inverse of caching,\n\nI don&#39;t think so.  The expiry we&#39;re talking about is expiration of the commitment on\nthe part of the source to notify the sink.  That commitment is the subscription\nabstraction, and can and probably should be reified.  Expiration defines a sort of\nTTL for an instance of that subscription abstraction.  (Actually, Expiration should\nprobably be expressed as TTL rather than any absolute date or time construct.)\n\nWRT caching, expiration and notification are both mechanisms for invalidating cached\nobjects, but IMO these are mostly orthogonal to the issue of how to model a\npublisher / subscriber relationship.\n\njb\n\n\n\n\n"}}
