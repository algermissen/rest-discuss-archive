You don&#39;t have to have a trashcan. You just have to \n&gt;expose the deletedness of a resource as a separate resource.\n&gt;\n\nSorry, I think you&#39;re off in the weeds here.  If I want to express that \na resource no longer exists on the server, I have a choice between \nresponding with a 404 or a 410 response.  I see no reason to move any \nfiles to a temporary URL, which if the file is undeleted, needs to change \nto a redirect, increasing URL proliferation and application complexity \nfor no reason I can discern from RFC 2616 or REST.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
