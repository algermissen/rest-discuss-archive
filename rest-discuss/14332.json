I=\r\n *think* this is wrong.\nThat &#39;text/html&#39; doesn&#39;t support DELETE is a flaw i=\r\nn a single\nrepresentation - the &quot;resource&quot; is still DELETEable as I have a =\r\n*link*\nand a DELETE method that&#39;s a part of the interface.  If I have a URI=\r\n\nto a resource, the HTTP interface allows me to DELETE it.  I&#39;ll say\nagain,=\r\n I think the intent is that the methods of the uniform interface\nare the in=\r\nterface between *system components* and to be applied to\nresources independ=\r\nent of a representation.  One way to effect behavior\nchanges would be to ch=\r\nange the granularity of resources being exposed\n- as opposed to specifying =\r\nsemantics for a specific representation or\nresource.\n\nI *think* this is wha=\r\nt Roy was addressing when he wrote this:\n\n&quot;Identifiers, methods, and media =\r\ntypes are orthogonal concerns =97\nmethods are not given meaning by the medi=\r\na type. Instead, the media\ntype tells the client either what method to use =\r\n(e.g., anchor implies\nGET) or how to determine the method to use (e.g., for=\r\nm element says to\nlook in method attribute). The client should already know=\r\n what the\nmethods mean (they are universal) and how to dereference a URI.&quot;\n=\r\n\n--tim\n\n[1] - http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertex=\r\nt-driven#comment-730\n\n"}}
