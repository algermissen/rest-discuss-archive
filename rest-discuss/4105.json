Of course it is possible \nto work around all those problems, but the CSS is elaborate enough to \ncreate more work than this is worth.  What makes the CSS elaborate is \nbrowser bugs.  Avoiding or working around the browser bugs requires \ncoding and debugging for each major browser, which means browser \ndetection and which requires a person skilled in browser bugs.   My \napplication would be more complex, more expensive to develop, and less \nrobust.\n\n&gt;&gt; Three, the usability of HTTP authentication is not OK.  If I do\n&gt;&gt; challenge/response, the user gets this scary popup dialog, without the\n&gt;&gt; important links for creating a new account and recovering your \n&gt;&gt; password.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is not a problem with HTTP authentication per se, but it is a\n&gt; problem with the lack of control over the UI that the available HTTP\n&gt; user agents present. If we could get the user agents fixed then a lot\n&gt; more folks would happily use HTTP authentication.\n\nThat is the right analysis.  Unfortunately not useful right now.\n\nHere is an interesting page on the problem:\nhttp://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2003/12/30/saving_http_authentication\n\n- Lucas Gonze\n\n\n"}}
