A lot more good stuff on Waka than he had previously discussed.\n&gt; RENDER?  Hmm, interesting.  Not sure why an extended POST wouldn&#39;t\n&gt; suffice for that, but I suppose a new method could be an optimization.\n\nI believe RENDER is safe and idempotent. I asked him about it at a \nconference many months ago and I understood what it meant then but am \nnot confident in my memory anymore.\n\nBased on this dim recollection I hypothesize that RENDER is about the \ndifference between retrieving a rendition and retrieving the &quot;most \nsemantically rich&quot; version: DocBook rather than HTML, SVG rather than GIF.\n\n&gt; MONITOR sounds familiar. 8-)\n\nYes, that will be very interesting. He also mentioned unsolicited \nresponses from servers to clients which is something that HTTP has long \nneeded.\n\n&gt; Note that Michael Radwin got the Web services comments backwards; they\n&gt; don&#39;t solve the N^2 problem, they are the N^2 problem.  Roy&#39;s point is\n&gt; that a uniform interface drives integration complexity to O(N) (which\n\n&gt; was Jeff&#39;s earlier comment)\n\nI think that the issue is pretty subtle...if the problem is to connect \nyour accounting system to my account auditing system, agreeing on Waka \nmethods and addressing is not going to collapse the problem to O(N). You \nneed many other levels of agreement. The problem with SOAP/WSDL is that \nthey don&#39;t standardize the things that CAN be standardized, with the \nmost obvious examples being the addressing model and the GET method.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
