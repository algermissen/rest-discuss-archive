(Better, at least, than cookies?).\n&gt;\n&gt; Not to me. Without control of the clients, I would never\n&gt; mandate Javascript for a function as vital as logging out.\n&gt;\n\nI was thinking more along the lines of http auth as as better option than \ncookies as a way to &quot;remember&quot; the user across requests w/o embedding a \nuser-id in the url.  (I realize this may not be entirely REStful)*.  The \njavascript thing was more about making it convenient for folks that want \nthat.  Regular old http auth logout (i.e., a new login box next time a \nprotected resource is accessed would still work if this thing was coded \nproperly).\n\nDo you have a recommendation for this use case?  I feel like if the REST \ncommunity can suggest some good practices here, one of the stumbling \nblocks for folks new to REST will be cleared somewhat.  I think the three \noptions are: http auth, cookies, or identity-in-url.\n\n-Peter\n\n* a nice quote from Adam Taft:\nhttp://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.java.restlet/3180\n&quot;First of all, I believe people need to get over this concept of &quot;logging\nin.&quot;  For a RESTful request, there really is no such thing; logging in\nimplies server state and sessions, which of course is not RESTful. When \nyou request a protected resource, the server should simply expect\nproper authentication headers to be included in the request.&quot;\n\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; --\n&gt; Aristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
