The server returns an HTTP \n&gt; Authentication challenge...\n\nI am the &quot;OP&quot; and I am surprised how my original question turned \ninto this long conversation :-)\n\nI was just asking how to solve a CGI programming problem with Python \nin a RESTful way!\n\nI can not do HTTP authentication from a Python CGI script, can I?  I \ntried to look for examples or to figure it out but I have been \nunsuccessful.  And then somebody explained to me that HTTP auth. is \nnot used by banks etc. on the internet, because it is not secure \nenough.  For my civilization like game HTTP auth. could be secure \nenough, but oh well, I don&#39;t know how to implement it from a CGI \nscript anyway.\n  \nSo I was thinking about setting up the &quot;login&quot; page with HTTPS and \nthis then calls a CGI script generating a &quot;sessionID&quot; passed along \nwith HIDDEN HTML FORM parameters on every next page, and then all \nthe next pages don&#39;t need SSL.  The nice thing for me is then that I \ndon&#39;t have to change source code when the SSL part is turned on \nlater.  I can develop it using Apache on my laptop (without SSL).\nOr is there a more RESTful way to do it?\n\n\n\n\n"}}
