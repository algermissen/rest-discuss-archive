Their purpose is to\n&gt; &gt; represent different document expectations.  We should use\n&gt; &gt; them that way!\n&gt;\n&gt; A rich set of MIME types is a good thing, but my issue with relying\n&gt; on them for extracting different types of content from a single\n&gt; resource comes down to a couple of points:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1.  How would you even know what content types are available?  If\n&gt;     an indeterminate set of representations were associated with\n&gt;     a resource, how would you even know what MIME types to chuck at it?\n&gt;\n&gt; 2.  Different content types may have completely different\n&gt;     interfaces.  In my own application I happen to split\n&gt;     some types out into &quot;resource-spaces&quot; that support\n&gt;     different methods:\n&gt;\n&gt;        /blog/x/y/z  GET only (HTML document)\n&gt;        /rss/x/y/x   GET only (RSS 2.0 document)\n&gt;        /xbel/x/y/z  GET, PUT, POST, DELETE (XBEL document)\n&gt;\n&gt;     It wouldn&#39;t feel particularly intuitive to have the available\n&gt;     methods change based on the Accept: header or even a query\n&gt;     string.\n&gt;\n&gt;     I could see using a Accept: header to distinguish different RSS\n&gt;     types from the resources in the /rss &quot;resource-space&quot; above because\n&gt;     they are at least clearly different representations of a similar\n&gt;     underlying type, but a unique URL (a la query string?) should be\n&gt;     available too. Perhaps the absence of either in the request could\n&gt;     result in a 300 Multiple Choices, etc.\n&gt;\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
