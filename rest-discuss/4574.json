We&#39;ll assume that we are putting\n&gt; &gt;&gt;together nice RESTful services and using all these methods correctly.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;What happens when we start combining these dereferences?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;For example:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  POST is used to create new resources\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  GET is used to retrieve a representation of a resource\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;On their own they&#39;re RESTful,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;No, the POST invocation isn&#39;t RESTful by itself.  In the examples\n&gt; &gt;people have given, the client expects that a particular POST invocation\n&gt; &gt;will result in a resource being created (and furthermore, that this\n&gt; &gt;resource will have a particular relationship to the POSTed\n&gt; &gt;representation).\n&gt; \n&gt; Nonsense, Mark.  Of course that is REST -- it is right in the\n&gt; HTTP standard.  The client is *told* by the server the URI of\n&gt; the new resource.  The client doesn&#39;t need any other expectation than\n&gt; simply following HTTP.\n\nI don&#39;t think you&#39;ve read the whole discussion, Roy, because that&#39;s\npart of my point.\n\nWould it have helped if I clarified that from the server&#39;s POV, it&#39;s\nRESTful since uniform semantics are *provided*, but from the client&#39;s\nit isn&#39;t since uniform semantics aren&#39;t *expected*?  Or are you saying\nthat REST doesn&#39;t constrain the client end of connectors?  That wouldn&#39;t\nmake much sense to me.\n\n&gt; &gt;Sometimes it&#39;s hard to see the forest for the trees here.  I&#39;ve found \n&gt; &gt;it\n&gt; &gt;helpful to focus on one of the primary objectives of the uniform\n&gt; &gt;interface; substitutability, i.e. the ability to substitute one service\n&gt; &gt;implementing POST with another service implementing POST.\n&gt; &gt;Query-via-POST fails this test because the expectation about the query\n&gt; &gt;results being returned cannot be provided by other services.  For\n&gt; &gt;example, if one swapped in a resource which spat out the input document\n&gt; &gt;to a printer, then clearly it wouldn&#39;t meet the expectation of\n&gt; &gt;performing a query.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry, that makes no sense.  The interface is substitutable.  Resources\n&gt; are not substitutable.  Nobody has an expectation that you can replace\n&gt; one resource with a different resource and have continuation of\n&gt; semantics.  What you get with REST is an interface that tells you\n&gt; how it works.  POST is part of that interface when used right.\n\nAy carumba, I see I described substitution in terms of implementation.\nMy bad.  But my point remains; that RESTfully, resources cannot be\nexpected to process, say, XQuery documents and return the results of the\nspecified query in the POST response, or in the form of another\nresource, or anyplace else for that matter, since providing such an\nexpectation is not uniform.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
