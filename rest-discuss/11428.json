Forums, Blog hosting,  \n&gt; Facebook,\n&gt; LinkedIn, etc. etc. etc.\n\nYes, but consider how little HTML is allowed by most of these, and  \nwhy...\n\n&gt; Plenty do but more do not, and many people on forums, blog posts and  \n&gt; mailing\n&gt; lists recommend to others not to do so because of the performance  \n&gt; cost. The\n&gt; cost of round trips has been used as a reason against certain web\n&gt; architectures such as in discussions of ROBOTS.TXT and 303.\n&gt;\n&gt; Most notably people who write about web performance optimization who  \n&gt; happen\n&gt; to work for your employer recommend against doing so:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#redirects\n&gt; http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#num_http\n\nOf course; the point I was trying to make is that avoiding a roundtrip  \nisn&#39;t going to motivate a whole new technology, at least one that&#39;s so  \nspecialised.\n\n&gt; BTW, the only person I&#39;ve gotten resistance from on this besides  \n&gt; Hixie is\n&gt; you... :)\n\nTrue, and if you&#39;re in a position to get your proposal accepted and  \nimplemented, I&#39;ll be the last to get in your way.\n\n&gt; But that misses the point; the most compelling use-cases are for where\n&gt; Javascript isn&#39;t available!\n\nIf you define it as declarative markup and implement it for the  \nbrowsing case with JavaScript, non-JS clients (e.g., robots) can still  \nuse the declarative markup, if they&#39;re aware of it.\n\n&gt; So would it help if I could show you numerous examples where people  \n&gt; are\n&gt; using Javascript to accomplish this with forms? Would that be the  \n&gt; &quot;pain&quot; you\n&gt; are looking for?\n&gt;\n&gt; That said, what about the pain of not being able to crawl forms that  \n&gt; use\n&gt; Javascript for this? Isn&#39;t that a compelling use case?\n\nI think I&#39;ll stop typing and listen to what others have to say.\n\n&gt; As an aside, I&#39;d be interested in any reference you have that I can  \n&gt; read up\n&gt; on &quot;standard&#39;s theory.&quot;\n\n\nCarl Cargill did a good job in &quot;Open Systems Standardization&quot;:\n   http://www.amazon.com/Open-Systems-Standardization-Business-Approach/dp/0132683199/\n\nCheers (and good night),\n\n--\nMark Nottingham     http://www.mnot.net/\n\n\n"}}
