Various papers can be had at [1].  IMHO, anybody in the business\nof building distributed systems --- and maybe software in general --- that hasn&#39;t read\nthese papers is doing themselves a disservice.  Lots of lessons, there.  It&#39;s *absolutely\nincredible* how much functionality is packed into such few and simple abstractions and\nsuch little code:  the entire operating system with all bells and whistles is an order of\nmagnitude smaller than the current X distribution.\n\nSpecial attention is warranted for [2], [3], [4], [5], and [6].  Anybody doing distributed\nfilesystem work specifically or protocol design in general should take a detailed look at\nthe man pages for 9P, the Plan 9 network &quot;file&quot; protocol.
