I do have a few questions though.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; * Identifying distributed objects with resolvable URIs is problematic\n&gt; since it seems to want to locate them on a single node, when in reality\n&gt; they live on several nodes.  Giving them several identifiers seems\n&gt; inelegant.\nBy &#39;distributed objects&#39; do you mean an object that has constituent data\nthat is served by multiple hosts, or do you mean a self-contained object\nthat has multiple redundant copies on several hosts?\nIf a single object is resident on several hosts then the single identifier\nneeds to access a single host that then in turns communicates with the\ndisparate constituent servers.\nIf the several nodes only host redundant copies, then you need a locator\nalgorithm that satisfies your technical requirements. Do you need to access\nthe same host several times for performance and only switch hosts for\nreliability in the face of a host failure?\n\n&gt; * Nodes must be able to move to different servers, and if there are URI\n&gt; identifiers for resources on a node that must be resolvable, then there\n&gt; must a mechanism for changing those identifiers when a node moves.  This\n&gt; could cause problems with historical audit information backed up on\n&gt; offline machines, unless two identifiers are stored.  A node could move\n&gt; many times, so many identifiers may be needed for each resource.\nIt sounds like we should talk about what capabilities a single server is\nproviding. You may need a proxy that forwards requests to the current\nhosting server, or possibly returns a Location header with the &#39;new&#39;\nlocation.\n\n\n"}}
