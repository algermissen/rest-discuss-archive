I have been unsuccessful to date in trying\nto interest Roy in the benefits of developing such models.\nThat makes it harder to know what it is we&#39;re modeling, and\non whose authority, but it&#39;s still possible to build a small\nset of models, each of which clarifies a particular interpretation\nof an HTTP method.  If not authority, at least it might lend\nsome clarity, especially if we can leverage graphical\nrepresentations of the models as a more accessable form for\ngeneral consumption.  Perhaps the modeling effort converges\non a small number of method usage patterns, which could then\nbe named, and those names might become useful to applications\nthat want to extend the HTTP contract?\n\nYou haven&#39;t said anything about this since mid-September, so\nan update from you would be quite valuable, I think.\n\nThanks,\n\nWalden\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Paul Prescod [mailto:paul@...]\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, September 18, 2002 4:31 PM\n&gt; To: S.

It&#39;s okay for HTTP to diverge but if the spec doesn&#39;t \n&gt; say clearly \n&gt; one way or another, then people will just guess. HTTP says basically \n&gt; &quot;DELETE means you should delete.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Roy describes a very mathematical mode for HTTP (resource is \n&gt; a mapping \n&gt; etc.) and if the HTTP methods were described in those terms \n&gt; it would be \n&gt; much easier to build interoperable software.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are hints that it was politics that prevented this from \n&gt; happening \n&gt; the first time around, but what should we do about it now? \n&gt; Just transmit \n&gt; the true meanings of the methods through mailing lists? \n&gt; Increment HTTP? \n&gt; Write an RFC clarifying? Wait for Roy&#39;s new protocol? I&#39;m \n&gt; being serious \n&gt; here: I think that there is a problem and a variety of \n&gt; solutions and am \n&gt; soliciting opinions on both issues.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Paul Prescod\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
