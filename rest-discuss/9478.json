Bowman wrote:\n&gt;  &gt;It just doesn&#39;t make sense to accept a DELETE, and subsequently return\n&gt;  &gt;404 or 410, and to still claim that there is an representation (with\n&gt;  &gt;that etag) mapped to that URI. The point of a DELETE is to remove that\n&gt;  &gt;mapping, and the point of 404/410 is so that the server can signal that\n&gt;  &gt;there are no representations left mapped to that URI.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Sending an ETag with a 410 response indicates that there is a 200 OK\n&gt; representation available, how? The 410 Gone status is hardly\n&gt; overridden by the presence of an ETag.\n\nBoth information items are in contradiction. It&#39;s not relevant whether \nthe status code overrides the ETag, or vice versa.\n\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; The purpose of the spec is to allow interoperability. If my\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; implementation does not cause interoperability problems then I don&#39;t see\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; where the spec has been violated, or needs to be changed to disallow\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; what I have implemented.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;The same can be said about SOAP (I guess), so would you defend SOAP as \n&gt; well?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I know nothing of SOAP, are you saying RFC 2616 needs to be altered to\n&gt; disallow SOAP? Why? Does SOAP violate RFC 2616?\n\nNo, I didn&#39;t say that. I just mentioned SOAP because it seems to be a \nwell-known example about how you can be HTTP compliant, without being \nRestful or even using HTTP in the best way.\n\n&gt;  &gt;&quot;10.4.5 404 Not Found\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;The server has not found anything matching the Request-URI. ...&quot;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Where does that say the 404 response itself can&#39;t have an ETag? The\n&gt; presence of an ETag says nothing about the state of the resource,\n\nYes it does. ETag is a response header, as defined in \n&lt;http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2616.html#rfc.section.6.2&gt;:\n\n&quot;...These header fields give information about the server and about \nfurther access to the resource identified by the Request-URI...&quot;\n\n&gt; only that the response body has an ETag. You are very good at\n&gt; reiterating your same point, as if the more times you say the same\n&gt; thing the more wrong it makes me...\n\nWell, I&#39;ll keep reiterating what the spec says, sorry.\n\n&gt;  &gt;It seems that you say that:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;- there&#39;s nothing here,\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Right, that is certainly implied by a 404 or a 410 response...\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;- but it has a representation,\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; No, I say the representation of the 404 or 410 response is an entity,\n&gt; and entities may be tagged.\n\nYes, it is an entity, and you can tag it, but (ironically) not with the \n&quot;ETag&quot; header. \n&lt;http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2616.html#rfc.section.14.19&gt;:\n\n&quot;The ETag response-header field provides the current value of the entity \ntag for the requested variant.&quot;\n\nNow I&#39;ll be the first to agree that the term &quot;requested variant&quot; needs \nto be clarified; it seems that the authors only thought about GET/HEAD \nwhen they wrote it.\n\n&gt;  &gt;- but if you ask for it, I&#39;ll not send it to you.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; If you keep repeating the same request, you&#39;ll keep getting a 404 or\n&gt; a 410 response, the presence of an ETag indicates that some other\n&gt; response is available, how?\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;Sorry, doesn&#39;t compute.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Nor does your repeated assertion that, by the very presence of an ETag,\n&gt; a 404 or a 410 response can be assumed to mean something besides &quot;Not\n&gt; Found&quot; or &quot;Gone&quot;. Since a 410 Gone response is cacheable, shouldn&#39;t\n\nNo, what I&#39;m saying is that a 404/410 response carrying an ETag does not \nmake sense.\n\n&gt; the spec say something about only using Last-Modified and other headers,\n&gt; while avoiding ETag? Your argument is that cache-control headers are\n&gt; not allowed on cacheable 410 responses? Why not?\n\nI didn&#39;t say that, and of course they are allowed.\n\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; OK, but only if you can justify why this restriction is needed despite\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; the fact that no interoperability problems result if it is not met.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;I do not believe there&#39;ll be no interop problem. But besides that, the\n&gt;  &gt;same could be said about a protocol that tunnels everything through\n&gt;  &gt;POST, right?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Yet you have failed to explain just what problems will arise. If a\n&gt; protocol tunnels everything through POST, it violates RFC 2616 how?\n\nIt doesn&#39;t, but it isn&#39;t a good application of HTTP.\n\n&gt; Why do we need to change the spec to disallow POST tunneling?\n\nWe don&#39;t, and I didn&#39;t say that.\n\n&gt; ...\n\nOK, let&#39;s just agree that we disagree and move on.\n\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n"}}
