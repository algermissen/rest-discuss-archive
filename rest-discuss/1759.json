REST is only useful as a concept\n&gt; that could be generally applied.  Otherwise, it may as well be called\n&quot;HTTP\n&gt; Guidelines&quot;.\n\nThis is a very good point. This discussion could (and probably should) be\nboiled down into &quot;HTTP Guidelines&quot; - but the REST principles stand apart\nfrom HTTP.\nPersonally, I have used the principles where I needed to build large-scale,\nlong-lived technology in support of products/applications - even when I\ncould not directly use HTTP for one reason or another. For example, I once\nbuilt a system using RDBMS and JMS to create a large scale subscription and\nnotification system - the characterstics it borrowed from REST were global\nidentifiers, generic interface and representations. The toughest part in\nterms of education was when the limited operations in the interface caused\nthe identifiers to grow (via &#39;sub-properties&#39;) - that was too much for many\npeople to understand & they just wanted to put everything into one slot\n(putting operation names into identifiers, etc).\n\n\n\n"}}
