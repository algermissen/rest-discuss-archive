When the \n&gt; file is in the trash, its status is &quot;used to exist&quot; but after it&#39;s \n&gt; been deleted from the trash its status is &quot;not known to have existed.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m simply applying this everyday computing paradigm to an HTTP server.\n\nThis is way off on several counts.\n\nFirstly, you aren&#39;t applying an &quot;everyday computing paradigm to an HTTP \nserver&quot;. You&#39;re applying a file-system paradigm to an HTTP server. \nYou&#39;re starting off with a category error, since HTTP servers aren&#39;t \nfile systems.\n\nSecond, you don&#39;t delete a file twice. Depending on which metaphor you \nprefer you are either first moving a file to a new location and then \ndeleting it, or else first deleting it and then deleting another version \nof it from a special location for deleted files.\n\nIf you want to model the first metaphor you would do a POST to some \nresource-moving resource and then a DELETE.\n\nIf you want to model the second you would do a DELETE and then somehow \nGET the location of the special location for deleted resources.\n\nDELETE deletes. I think it&#39;s made perfectly clear that DELETE deletes in \nRFC 2616. When you have deleted a resource, it is deleted.\n\nDELETE /parrot HTTP/1.1 does not move the parrot to /pining/parrot\n\nHe&#39;s not pining! He&#39;s passed on! This parrot is no more! He has ceased \nto be! He&#39;s expired and gone to meet his maker! He&#39;s a stiff! Bereft of \nlife, he rests in peace! If you hadn&#39;t nailed him to the perch he&#39;d be \npushing up the daisies! His metabolic processes are now history! He&#39;s \noff the twig! He&#39;s kicked the bucket, he&#39;s shuffled off his mortal coil, \nrun down the curtain and joined the bleedin&#39; choir invisibile!! THIS IS \nAN EX-PARROT!\n\n\n"}}
