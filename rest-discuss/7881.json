In our case (RESTful Web services API), the common\n&gt; denominator should be all of HTTP 1.1 and just HTTP 1.1.\n\nMultiple implementations of the same API is rarely necessary and has \nresulted in overly complex designs throughout the Java class library. \nThe big smell is use of the abstract factory design pattern. That&#39;s a \nsure sign of architecture astronautics and a confusing, hard-to-use, \nhard-to-deploy API.\n\nIf multiple implementation are necessary, they should operate by \nreplacing the JAR file with their own classes, not by using abstract \nfactories to choose from among different classes at runtime. Abstract \nfactories are only appropriate when the *same executing program* needs \nsimultaneous access to more than one implementation. This rare and not \nthe case here.\n\nOf course, adopting this principle would mean that the resulting work \ncould not be bundled into the JDK. This would be a good thing. The JDK \nis already too big, and most people don&#39;t need this. This project makes \na lot more sense a non-standard, open source development that can stand \nor fall on its own strengths and weaknesses, rather than one that is \npropped up by being bundled with the JDK.\n\n-- \n﻿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
