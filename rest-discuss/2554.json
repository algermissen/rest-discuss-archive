Idempotency is another. I think that PUT \nwill have side effects, but idempotent ones. For instance if I have a \nresource representing the list of titles of documents of pages on my \nsite, PUT-ting to a document will change the list as a side-effect. But \nchanging the resource over and over again will not have any different \neffect than doing it once. So it is idempotent.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
