It should IMO be a\nheader and / or an additional server-initiated NOTIFY &quot;response&quot; method,\nlatter of which should not be directed to a resource but (as certain other\nmethods, like OPTIONS) directed to a namespace / message dispatching\nauthority.  My reasoning for the latter is a bit involved but IIRC well\ndocumented in the discussion of HTTP Events.\n\nShort version:  doing it thus avoids presupposing a &quot;model&quot; for resources\nwhich accept events and affords much greater flexibility for server\nimplementations.  Also plays nicely with caches for the purpose of cache\nexpiry notifications, which shouldn&#39;t be directed to a reified cache but to\nan authority.  There might be other motivations for reifying caches, but\nthis isn&#39;t one of them.  Making subscribers authorities rather than\nresources avoids some nasty recursive thinking ala the problems Lucas was\neluding to, but...  I&#39;m flexible on that issue.\n\nJb\n\n\n"}}
