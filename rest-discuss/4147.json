Any GET on a resource\nwithin the context of the t=\r\nransaction must identify the\ntransaction in the URI. Any GET on the origina=\r\nl URI must be\ntreated as outside of any transaction.\n\nInitiating a transact=\r\nion really creates a new view of the entire\nresource space, so it makes sen=\r\nse that any resources accessed\nwithin the transaction would be accessed at =\r\nURIs hierarchically\nsubordinate to the URI of the transaction itself. Howev=\r\ner,\nmunging the existing URIs on the client is undesirable. Also, any\nrelat=\r\nive URIs inside the representations of those various\nresources may be throw=\r\nn off; the server would have to introspect\nthe representations it&#39;s returni=\r\nng and munge any URIs therein\nitself, and the client would have to be disci=\r\nplined about only\nfollowing URIs returned from the server (or built accordi=\r\nng to\nrules returned from the server, as for an HTML form submission),\nand =\r\nemphatically not constructing URIs itself -- but then that&#39;s\njust good REST=\r\n sense, anyway.\n\nJustin\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Jeff Bone [ma=\r\nilto:jbone@...]\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, February 11, 2004 7:16 AM\n&gt; To:=\r\n Vincent D Murphy\n&gt; Cc: Seairth Jacobs; rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subj=\r\nect: Re: [rest-discuss] REST Transaction Process\n&gt;\n&gt; IMHO, the transaction =\r\nis an object (resource) in itself. This\n&gt; is a standard pattern in transact=\r\nion managers, cf. Java&#39;s\n&gt; transaction facility, OODBs that support long-ru=\r\nnning\n&gt; transactions, etc. Given this, it&#39;s appropriate for it to have\n&gt; a =\r\nURI. I&#39;m not sure munging the original resource onto the\n&gt; transaction URI =\r\nis a great solution, but it&#39;s better than\n&gt; burying things in the headers.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Reifying the transaction is a good thing!\n&gt;\n&gt; jb\n&gt;\n&gt; On Feb 11, 2004, a=\r\nt 3:03 AM, Vincent D Murphy wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; On 11 Feb 2004, at 05:45, Seairth =\r\nJacobs wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Check out http://www.seairth.com/web/resttp.html an=\r\nd tell\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me what you think.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I like your idea, but I wonder if i=\r\nt may be possible to\n&gt; &gt; simplify.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Instead of prefixing the URIs of=\r\n requests in the transaction,\n&gt; &gt; could the transaction not be referred to =\r\nby a request header?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So instead of translating (e.g.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; PUT /=\r\npath/resource1\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; PUT /t/123/path/resource1\n&gt; &gt; why not have\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; PUT /path/resource1\n&gt; &gt; Transaction: /t/123\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; or similar.
