This is me asking\nhow to create a typical CRUD module for a web application that is RESTful.\nAnd forgive the fact that this has probably already been answered 1000 times\nbefore; if it has I haven&#39;t seen it.\n\nWhat started this was someone asked the following on the TurboGears list:\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve been refactoring my admin interface and trying to get it \n&gt; nice and RESTful ( oh the buzzwords! ). As I am new to this \n&gt; resting business, I&#39;m wondering, is there a compelling reason \n&gt; to need to do:\n&gt; \n&gt; page/7/edit\n&gt; vs\n&gt; page/edit/7\n&gt; \n&gt; The example in the book uses the first, but I&#39;m finding the \n&gt; second would be much easier to do with CherryPy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks helpful gurus!\n\nSeveral people replied with mechanics of TurboGears but nobody mentioned the\nuse of the edit verb so I decided to clarify and then realized that, while I\ncould tell him what not to do (i.e. &quot;don&#39;t use verbs&quot;), I couldn&#39;t tell him\nhow to do it correctly.\n\nIn the past when I have written such modules I would typically write them\nlike this:\n\n\thttp://examples.com/pages/{page_id}/?mode={mode}\n\nWhere {mode} was one of:\n\n\t&lt;nothing&gt;\n\tadd\n\tinsert\n\tedit\n\tupdate\n\tlist\n\tdelete\n\tconfirm\n\nAnd maybe a few more.  BTW, these are not that &quot;well designed&quot; URLs, but\nit&#39;s how I coded before I heavily researched URL concepts.  \n\nNote that there are several interesting pairs: &quot;add&quot; and &quot;insert&quot;, &quot;edit&quot;\nand &quot;update&quot;, and &quot;delete&quot; and &quot;confirm&quot;   Both &quot;add&quot; and &quot;edit&quot; displayed a\ndata entry form whereas &quot;insert&quot; and &quot;update&quot; insert and update from those\nforms, respectively, with the latter 302 redirecting to &lt;nothing&gt; (a.k.a.\n&quot;show&quot;)  and &quot;confirm&quot; displaying a delete confirmation screen with &quot;delete&quot;\nperforming the actual delete and 301 redirecting to &quot;page/list&quot;  And when\n&quot;add&quot; mode was requested it contained {mode} as a hidden field with a value\nof &quot;insert.&quot; When &quot;edit&quot; mode was requested, the hidden {mode} fields got a\nvalue of &quot;update.&quot;  It all works well and good, but I now understand its not\nRESTful.  \n\nTo be RESTful, we GET &quot;page/{page_id}&quot; for display, PUT to &quot;page/{page_id}&quot;\nfor an update, DELETE &quot;page/{page_id}&quot; for a delete, and GET &quot;page/list&quot; for\na list. But how do we deal with getting an edit form before the PUT?  How do\nwe handle delete confirmation?  How do we handle requesting a data entry\nform designed for a new page (POST to &quot;page/new&quot;?)   Answer both assuming\nAJAX and also no AJAX, if you will.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org - http://t.oolicio.us\n\nP.S. This soulds like a great cookbook solution and I debated where to\nsubmit the question but defaulted to the larger community to ensure getting\nmore perspectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
