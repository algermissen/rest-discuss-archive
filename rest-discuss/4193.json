SOAP&#39;s intermediary model is a good example of this sort of\nthing.  PEP&#39;s[1] too.  And I guess Waka will have something similar too.\n\n [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-http-pep\n\n&gt; The scenario I have in mind is an intermediary that acts as a link engine\n&gt; or link server and possibly resolves inline links or links from a link database\n&gt; thus enhancing the returned representations. An intermediary control header\n&gt; might look like this:\n&gt; \n&gt; GET /some/path HTTP/1.1\n&gt; Host: example.org\n&gt; Allow-Intermediary-Enhancement: Transclusions; Annotations; Backlinks\n\nRight.\n\n&gt; The list of enhancement options is not thought-out; only given to illustrate\n&gt; my question.\n&gt; \n&gt; For RDF, would it be RESTful to enable/disable inferencing by intermediaries?\n\nAs long as the effect of the &quot;enhancement&quot; is on a per-message basis -\ni.e. with no persistent side effects for other messages - then that\nshould be ok I&#39;d say.\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
