Maybe a header? But a deletion isn&#39;t really an error. It&#39;s\n&gt; just a deletion.\n&gt;\n&gt; If there are notification-related errors that we need to report then\n&gt; there could be a header for them. In general, existing HTTP status codes\n&gt; will not be appropriate.\n\nI believe that this is wierd to think about because *whose* state is involved is\nnot, in the case of callbacks to report provider-side errors, the server.  So,\nrather than reporting server side status, I propose that callbacks to report\nstatus affect the state of a status resource.\n\nPUT /callbacks/stocks/APLX/status HTTP/1.1\n\n410 GONE\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
