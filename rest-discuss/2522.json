Consider the \nbiggest perceived difference between web services of a year ago and the \nREST model. It was: &quot;should there be a predefined method for getting \ninformation or is it okay for everyone to choose their own methods.&quot; It \nis pretty clear that significant parts of the Web would keel over and \ndie if we had not standardized on the GET method. What would clicking on \nlinks do? How would Google work?\n\nSimilarly, if the Web didn&#39;t have POST then it couldn&#39;t support creative \nactivities like page authoring, booking flights, discussion etc.\n\nSo I see those as irreducible.\n\n&gt; ... What other technical characteristics of the web account for \n&gt; that? Is there a RESTful core that&#39;s holding the whole thing together, \n&gt; or are there other principles at work? Would those other principles on \n&gt; their own be sufficient for a viable web?\n\nI don&#39;t personally know where REST stops and &quot;web architecture&quot; starts \nso I can&#39;t answer that question. I am confident that without the fixed, \nstateless, address-centric interface of HTTP, the Web wouldn&#39;t work the \nway we know it today.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n\n"}}
