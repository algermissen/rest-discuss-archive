REST is the architecture of the Web and a REST\n&gt; toolkit would be a piece of software that helps you build the mediating\n&gt; layer between your application and the Web. AFAIK, that&#39;s what (e.g.)\n&gt; J2EE and Zope are used for. Now that XML has come along it makes sense\n&gt; to want to extend these things. Just as they had native knowledge of\n&gt; HTML, you might want to give them native knowledge of XML and RDF. And\n&gt; maybe newer toolkits could better enforce best practices. But overall, I\n&gt; see no problem calling any web development platform a REST toolkit. REST\n&gt; is not something new.\n\nI agree with your position that any web development platform could be called a\nREST toolkit.  However, I think a more RESTful toolkit should have types defined\nin its namespace that correspond to Fielding&#39;s documented approach if it&#39;s going\nto make programming RESTfully feel more concretely similar (and IMO easier to\ncomprehend the REST style).\n\nFor example, here are some of the objects that are being implemented in my\ntoolkit (sorry I keep bringing up my own vaporware, but it&#39;s the most concrete\nthing I have right now): CObject, CString, CList, CTable, CResource,\nCRepresentation, CConnector, CStream, CRequest, CResponse, CComponent, CFilter,\nCProxy, etc.\n\nAdd a handful of sample apps to a class framework like this and you&#39;ve got a\nnice simple way to communicate the essence of the RESTful style.\n\n-Philip\n\n\n"}}
