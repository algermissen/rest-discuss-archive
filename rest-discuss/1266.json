In general the horse-race story about REST vs. SOAP\n&gt; is overshadowing meaty stuff.  EG, there seemed to be a grudge match\nsetup\n&gt; about Paul&#39;s Google article on xml.com.\n\nIMHO, the discussion about meatier stuff is hampered by the types of\nrhetoric we saw at the panel - remember when I took notes and then cited a\nstream of terms like &quot;democratrization&quot;, &quot;no virtues&quot;, &quot;binary would have\nbeen just as good&quot;, etc?  It would be much more productive (again, IMHO) if\nwe could talk in terms of specifics suggestions.\n\nI also believe that most of the asserted virtues of either an all-GET (or\neven a more-GET) approach seem to be stated in ways that go over the head\nof most of the intended audience - even when we had a VERY technical\naudience like we enjoyed at the ETCON.\n\nThe one point that I&#39;m most proud of is when I contrasted SOAP vs REST vs\nGET approaches in what I thought was a more digestible form.  I was\npleasantly surprised that I got no pushback from those sitting to my right,\nin fact after the panel you seemed to indicate that I had not\nmisrepresented REST.\n\nIf others who had attended feel that this part was comprehendable beyond\nthe scope of the people sitting on the panel, I will try to write it up.\n\n- Sam Ruby\n\n\n"}}
