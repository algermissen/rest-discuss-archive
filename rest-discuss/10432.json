The reason is that SOAP doesn&#39;t define an app model; it only def=\r\nines an extensible messaging model that can be used in any number of ways. =\r\nThis is one of the reasons why it is often being used in contexts that are =\r\nabsolutely not Web friendly.\n\nHowever, it is possible to build REST/Web fri=\r\nendly app models that include SOAP. As an example you may want to have a lo=\r\nok at Microsoft Robotics Studio [1] which uses a SOAP-based protocol that w=\r\ne call DSSP [2]. As the name suggests, we like robots but the model actuall=\r\ny applies much broader (see for example [3]).\n\nHope this helps,\n\nHenrik\n\n[1=\r\n] http://microsoft.com/robotics\n[2] http://purl.org/msrs/dssp.pdf\n[3] http:=\r\n//blogs.msdn.com/asehmi/archive/2008/02/27/distributed-computing-gets-spruc=\r\ned-up-with-ccr-dss.aspx\n\n&gt;         Its me pavan again with one more questio=\r\nn. I have read that\n&gt; SOAP 1.2 incorporated some of the REST principles but=\r\n no where i got\n&gt; the exact material regarding those. DO anybody know about=\r\n any article\n&gt; or kind of like that to look for those.\n\n"}}
