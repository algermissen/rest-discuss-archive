It&#39;s an architecture, not a framework.\n\n\n&gt; I have come across more robust alternatives to REST for online\n&gt; storage, such as SOAP and WEBDAV (rfc2518) used by Apple&#39;s\n&gt; idisk.  However RESTful online storage services are much more\n&gt; common than other online storage services.\n\nYes. I&#39;m working on one as well where the meta data is communicated\nwith JSON. I hope to make a linux implementation of the client. At the\nmoment it&#39;s FUSE based.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
