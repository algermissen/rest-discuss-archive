Cause having out=\r\n the \nXML Schema seems more cool, but in the WADL file you can define your =\r\n\nXPath expressions to access the elements of the representation (dunno \nif =\r\nthis can be done in a xsd file).\n\nThanks.\n\n[1] Leonard Richardson and Sam R=\r\nuby, Restful Web Services, O&#39;Reilly. \n\n\n"}}
