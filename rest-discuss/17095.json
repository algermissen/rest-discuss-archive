Bowman &lt;eric@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, anyone can write an autonomous client that is tightly bound to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; your particular service.  Often that is good enough.  Rdfa may help in\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the future.  However, i think it suffer too because the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; expectations/requirements of the client are not surfaced explicitly in\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the request.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Please elaborate, in terms of my updated example.\n&gt; \n&gt; My biggest concern is that rdfa is hidden.\n&gt; \n&gt; The processing model for (x)html is basically &quot;render the document so\n&gt; that the user can interpret it base on the latent semantics in the\n&gt; natural language text and let the user decide which other related\n&gt; resources to interact with next&quot;.  In this processing model rdfa is\n&gt; entirely superfluous, as is a lot of the other markup in most web\n&gt; pages.  It is perfectly legal for an intermediate to complete rewrite\n&gt; the html as long at that transformation does not negatively impact the\n&gt; processing model (ie, it is still easy for the human at the end to\n&gt; understand the page).  A use case for such transformations is page\n&gt; simplification for rendering on small form factor devices.  This\n&gt; ability for intermediates to provide value is a very important feature\n&gt; of rest architectures.\n\nAFAICT, that&#39;s usually just the view of the DOM that is simplified, not \nthe actual XHTML itself, however would be interested to know if you can \npoint to a specific example or whether it&#39;s just an edge-case worry.\n\nIn any event, surely an autonomous client would not be using one of \nthese intermediates(?)\n\n&gt; Basing an autonomous client architecture entirely on rdfa embedded in\n&gt; xhtml seems risky because the media type provides no protection for\n&gt; the rdfa.  An intermediate that chooses to strip the rdfa out would be\n&gt; perfectly legal.  Removing the rdfa has zero impact on the html\n&gt; processing model.  A system that relies for it&#39;s basic function on\n&gt; xhtml+rdfa is effectively relying on an implementation detail of the\n&gt; current set of web servers and intermediates.  That implementation\n&gt; detail could, legally, change at any moment.\n\nNot sure if that is the case, but I&#39;ll check it out, and if it is \nlegally the case will see what I can do to ensure that it isn&#39;t legally \nthe case, the 1.1 specs are all still in LC at the minute so still time \nto fix if indeed it is an issue.\n\n&gt; Most autonomous clients require a different processing model than the\n&gt; one provided by (x)html.  Automata that can use use (x)html processing\n&gt; model -- eg, search engine spiders -- definitely should.  However, the\n&gt; clients i usually write lack the requisite natural language\n&gt; interpretation ai needed to achieve the necessary level of clarity\n&gt; regarding the various bits of data and relationships in an html\n&gt; document.  Machine readable precision can be layered into xhtml using\n&gt; rdfa, but a client that relies on the rdfa being there has a\n&gt; fundamentally different processing model than a browser.\n\nIt&#39;s generally a different client design TBH, many older/simpler \nclients, and in some respects many developers, feel the need to consider \nthe entire data packet, when in reality you typically only look to see \nif what you need is there, and if not move along. It&#39;s more of a hook-in \nbased design where not only are you looking for the presence of RDFa, \nbut your typically looking for the presence of certain properties or for \nthings of a certain type, it&#39;s entirely natural, and feasible, to have \nseveral different clients all considering the same data at the same \ntime, tasked with different jobs. Along the lines of env.onNewData = \nmyfunc; myfunc = function(data) { if data.hasType == &quot;Person&quot; then \nshowPersonDetails(data) } - if the data the specific client, perhaps \nbetter termed &quot;agent&quot;, isn&#39;t there, then the client/agent simply does \nnothing.\n\n&gt; I think an `application/rdfa+xhtml+xml` media type would solve most of\n&gt; these problem, though.  That would surface the fact that the rdfa was\n&gt; an important part of the processing model for the representation to\n&gt; both the server and intermediates.\n\nTBH, people wouldn&#39;t set the mediatype correctly, and if any \nintermediate was considering the document itself to strip it down, then \nit&#39;s looking at the data any way so can see if it contains RDFa or \nwhatever else.\n\nBest,\n\nNathan\n\n"}}
