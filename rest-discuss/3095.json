I&#39;ve got my own little toolkit that \n&gt;I use for simple Python projects where Zope etc. are overkill. But here \n&gt;is where I get nervous: a toolkit that helps people use HTTP as it was \n&gt;designed to be used is an HTTP toolkit. Perhaps it is a _better_ HTTP \n&gt;toolkit than the ones that exist, but it is still an HTTP toolkit. \n&gt;Phil&#39;s example code is a perfect example of using HTTP right. I won&#39;t \n&gt;argue if Phil calls it a REST toolkit but I don&#39;t see a clear boundary \n&gt;between &quot;good&quot; HTTP toolkits and REST toolkits. When an HTTP toolkit \n&gt;strays from REST it is probably just a misunderstanding by the toolkit&#39;s \n&gt;author and we should probably work with them to correct it.\n&gt;\nI agree.  But given existing bad habits and the lack of understanding of \nwhat REST really is (protocol vs style), I think &quot;RESTful HTTP toolkit&quot; \nor &quot;REST-compliant HTTP toolkit&quot; would be better terminology.\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Also, some people probably think that REST toolkit would embed a bunch \n&gt;of XML smarts. This stems from the confusion that REST is about using \n&gt;XML over HTTP. I don&#39;t think Phil has this confusion but I bet many \n&gt;people asking for REST toolkits do!\n&gt;\n&gt;  Paul Prescod\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!
