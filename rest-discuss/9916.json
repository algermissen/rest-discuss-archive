Now, in my average web development I would just escape these\n&gt; with HTML entities.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, my programmatic clients now have to jump through some sort of\n&gt; unescaping hoop to get that data back into it&#39;s original format.\n&gt;\n&gt; To me this seems like a frustrating excercise for the client.  I would\n&gt; expect after Xpath-ing out a piece of data I should be more or less\n&gt; ready to go.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve looked into using CDATA blocks instead, but in FF/IE the content\n&gt; is then not displayed at all.\n&gt;\n&gt; Any advice?  Is this escape/unescape game just a part of the cost?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; -Miles\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
