One which I hope, over time, motivates as much effort going into\ncreating new-n-improved hypertext-control markup languages as currently\ngoes into avoiding the hypertext constraint.  I appreciate the debate,\nas it helps me figure out how to express the answers you&#39;re looking for.\nSpecifically, what&#39;s wrong with a RESTful system (assuming one exists)\nbased on IDLs?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The &quot;without a context&quot; refers to dooming the IDLs just because they\n&gt; are IDLs, in any possible situation. That said, I totally agree with\n&gt; what you say, taken for granted the WSDL is an IDL used as an\n&gt; out-of-band definition of flow for REST. \n&gt;\n\nIDLs don&#39;t really provide a set of application-state transitions to\nchoose from.  REST is all about the API explaining *how* a collection of\ngeneric interfaces are coordinated into applications, expressed in-band\nand decoupled from resource state.  I don&#39;t understand m2m solutions\nwhich start from the premise of moving the &quot;how&quot; out-of-band -- the\nsystems being described are possible with REST and purport to have the\nsame goals, so if that&#39;s the way forward all I require is falsification\nof the hypertext constraint, first.  IDLs describe resource interfaces,\nnot goal-driven application interfaces; if m2m is all about goals,\nthen why start by removing their expression from the application states?\n\n&gt; \n&gt; As Mike pointed out, removing REST from the picture, and trying to\n&gt; make WSDL a dynamically consumable, lean document, not oriented to\n&gt; hypertext driven APIs but to messaging ones, not necessarily over\n&gt; HTTP: is still WSDL as bad? Maybe it is good for something, in other\n&gt; context.\n&gt; \n\nIt depends on what&#39;s best for the system being designed, sure.  But,\nif the system is intended to exhibit the desirable characteristics\ninduced by the application of the hypertext constraint, then why would\nit be just as good, or better, not to apply the hypertext constraint?\nA context where WSDL would be better, is one where coupling client to\nserver around an out-of-band API has benefit.  But, none of the\nexamples I&#39;ve seen of WSDL/WADL describe systems which wouldn&#39;t benefit\nfrom the decoupling provided by an in-band hypertext API, unless their\nscope is restricted to the point where REST isn&#39;t needed (or rational\nto purue).\n\n&gt;\n&gt; So, to answer your question, I guess no, it makes no sense to use a\n&gt; IDL to represent REST Hypertext states transitions or flows. I can\n&gt; almost call it an oxymoron. I hate RPC for services implementation,\n&gt; still RPC may be good in some other situations. Just not for REST\n&gt; anyway.\n&gt; \n\nI wouldn&#39;t hesitate to set up a quickie RPC system for the internal\npurposes of a small office -- which wouldn&#39;t need to exhibit a fraction\nof the desirable characteristics induced by applying REST&#39;s constraints.\nI&#39;d only apply the minimal set of constraints required to induce the\ncharacteristics needed within that context; XML-RPC may very well fit\nthe bill, because I&#39;d be more interested in completing the project than\nadding complexity to proactively solve problems I wouldn&#39;t even have.\n\nOnce we&#39;re talking &quot;Web Services&quot; though, we&#39;re talking about the\nproblems of extending a limited set of ubiquitous semantics across\norganizational boundaries over a flaky, anarchic network with global\nscale.  Dealing with these problems adds complexity -- XML-RPC lacks\nsuch complexity, so it doesn&#39;t solve these problems well.  CORBA solves\na different set of problems while ignoring these.  REST solves these\nproblems with minimal added complexity.  WS-* failed to solve these\nproblems, by adding way too much complexity.  So my money&#39;s still on\nREST for leveraging the Web&#39;s power to the benefit of any system which\nprofits by being on the Web (extended a la ARRESTED or CREST, or not).\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
