Your answer  \n&gt; seems to advocate using shared types, such as &quot;application/xhtml \n&gt; +xml&quot; instead of specialized MIME types such as &quot;application/ \n&gt; vnd.bank.org.account+xml&quot;.  Yet that was the same as I&#39;ve been  \n&gt; saying?!?\n\nNope. If you read my previous response on tunneling and Dare&#39;s post,  \nit is the opposite of what you are saying.\n\n&gt; For RESTful applications, the content type should only convey what  \n&gt; hypermedia representation was used (XHTML vs. Atom vs. RDF etc.).\n\nCan you explain how came to that conclusion?\n\n&gt;&gt; if(someFunc(uri1)) // i.e. determine the kind of the URI used\n&gt;&gt; {\n&gt;&gt;    doBlah();\n&gt;&gt; }\n&gt;&gt; else if(someFunc(uri2))\n&gt;&gt; {\n&gt;&gt;    doBlahBlah();\n&gt;&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t understand this code.  Why would the client inspect the URI  \n&gt; to determine what to do? URIs are opaque and should be used as is  \n&gt; (unless the context prescribes how URI can be constructed, such as  \n&gt; URI templates or form elements).  Maybe it&#39;s just because I&#39;ve never  \n&gt; such code before, but do people really do this?\n\nFlickr style client code may look like the above. Or, take a client  \napp that is trying to work with the three photo sharing sites I  \nmentioned. Please don&#39;t read too much into the structure of the code.  \nIt is the dependency I am pointing out.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; So, in conclusion, I agree with you that the answer varies, but I\n&gt;&gt;&gt; believe the outcome is not driven by the application, but its reach\n&gt;&gt;&gt; (which you may have alluded to already by stating interoperability\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and compatibility).  The more user agents there are interacting with\n&gt;&gt;&gt; your API, the more driven you should be to fit it into an\n&gt;&gt;&gt; established MIME type.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Compatibility considerations do sometimes require introducing new\n&gt;&gt; media types.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is a contradiction in terms.  How can you justify introducing a  \n&gt; new media type for the purpose of compatibility?  By definition  \n&gt; nothing in the world will be compatible with it!\n\nNope. For the same reason XHTML has a different media type than HTML.\n\n&gt; I stand by my initial position that custom types are bad.  New  \n&gt; RESTful APIs should either build on AtomPub or a form of semantic  \n&gt; HTML.  The choice will be\n\nFair enough. I can&#39;t object :)\n\nSubbu\n\n"}}
