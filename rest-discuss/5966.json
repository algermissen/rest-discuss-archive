Take a look at http://www.yahoo.com.  It&#39;s got a lot of \nresources on one page.  It&#39;s got a directory, a list of movies, stuff \nabout small businesses, featured services, entertainment, buzz log, \nnews, traffic, etc.  Are you saying the only RESTful way to do this is \nto give each of these separate URLs?  I guess the pictures are already \nbeing downloaded as separate resources, so maybe it&#39;s not too much of a \nstretch.  It just seems so much more efficient for the server to compose \nit on the fly.  But maybe the advantage of caching outweighs it.\n&gt; That&#39;s true. It&#39;s more complicated though because you&#39;ve still got 2\n&gt; things instead of one (a resource and the session).\n&gt;   \nIf you want to have things like online banking, or personalized site \npages (like Yahoo can do), or web mail, I don&#39;t see how you can avoid \nhaving two things.  E.g., the URL for your April bank statement is \nhttp://www.bank.com/statements/200604, and your identity is passed along \nsome other way, say through a cookie.  You could instead have a URL that \nincluded your identity, like \nhttp://www.bank.com/accounts/928349/statements/200604, but if you \nbookmarked it, it would always go to your account (at which point it \nwould authenticate you).  So you couldn&#39;t make one bookmark that would \nwork for everyone.\n&gt; But consider the scalability implications of never being able to have\n&gt; an intermediary cache the resource (because you don&#39;t know when it\n&gt; will change).\n&gt;   \nWell, you never know when any resource might change, right?\n\n-- \nLyle Kopnicky\nSoftware Project Engineer\nVeicon Technology, Inc.\n\n\n"}}
