One fundamental principle is that the URI\n&gt; identifies the resource, nothing else. Addressing and authentication are\n&gt; two separate concerns, and you&#39;re mixing them up. Personalized resources\n&gt; require personalized URLs.\n&gt;\n\nActually, the URI DOES identify the resource and nothing else.  It&#39;s the \ncookie (to be used only in the XHR &#39;personalizing&quot; request) that handles \nidentity (and NOT as part of the page request).  Requesting the page URI \nreturns the exact same resource no matter who the user is (and thus it&#39;s \ncacheable).  It&#39;s the CLIENT that &quot;decides&quot; if it wants to take the next \nstep and personalize the page by firing an XHR.\n\n[XHR = XMLHTTPRequest]\n\n&gt; The personalized URLs don&#39;t actually have to contain the user name if\n&gt; that bothers you for some reason. However they do have to be unique to\n&gt; the user for whom the data is personalized.\n&gt;\n\nNo, I see no problem w/ user-id in the url, I was simply aiming to come up \nw/ a way to have a web application ALWAYS present some personalized data \nbut still provide a generic url that could be shared with other users AND \nwhich could have all of the benefits that caching will provide.\n\nI see that this page could be seen as breaking REST, but how far up the \nstack does the system need to be RESTful?  Everything below this \nbrowser-based view follows REST principles and offers all of the benefits \nof REST.  It seems to me one of the goals of REST is to facilitate new \nuses/remixes of resources in lots of ways, many of which will not (and \nneed not) be RESTful in the final use case.\n\nI don&#39;t mean to be argumentative -- just trying to find the \nedges/best-principles, etc.  Perhaps I&#39;d be better off &quot;mixing&quot; on the \nserver side using XSLT and the document() function towards the same end \nwhile requiring initial browser request to include the user-id in the URL.\n\nthanks!\nPeter Keane\n\n\n&gt; It gets a little tricky when, as you describe here, one page contains\n&gt; resources accumulated from multiple URLs, but full REST requires that\n&gt; the page itself still have a unique, identifiable URL. The more you move\n&gt; away from this the less well the Web will work for you.\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\n&gt; Java I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\n&gt; http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\n&gt; http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n&gt;\n\n"}}
