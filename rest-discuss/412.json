This leads to bad\napplication behavior (think about how the old\nbrowsers used to lock up while doing DNS lookup)\n\n&gt; &gt; What happens with HTTP when you can&#39;t reach the\n&gt; &gt; server?\n&gt;\n&gt; SMTP is fundamentally synchronous. The client connects to the server.\n&gt; They do some TCP negotiations and then some SMTP negotiations. When they\n&gt; are both happy they quit. I would be more impressed if you compared HTTP\n&gt; to UDP.\n\nNo SMTP is fundametally asynchronous.\nApplications hand of messages to an SMTP MTA\n(message transfer agent).  The MTA then deals with\ndelivery on its own time and delivers messages\nback to applications when they arrive.\n\nThe TCP/UDP issue is orthogonal (about delivery\nerrors -- even on fast connections).\n\n-Alex-\n\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
