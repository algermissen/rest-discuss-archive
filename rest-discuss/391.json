[1]  A generator looks like and is similar to a function,\n&gt; with some important differences;  it is similar in many ways to the concept of\n&gt; a monad from functional languages.  They are sort of anti-idempotent:  a\n&gt; generator reifies a potentially infinite stream as a function upon which\n&gt; sucessive calls which yield sucessive values from the stream.  This is a great\n&gt; language-level feature that makes modeling and using infinite streams much,\n&gt; much easier.  The same kind of thing can be achieved with explicit\n&gt; continuations / coroutines, but IMO generators are much simpler and more\n&gt; intuitive.  They&#39;re also a good step towards unifying a number of related\n&gt; concepts, namely functions, streams, and objects.\n&gt;\n&gt; $0.02,\n&gt;\n&gt; jb\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] http://python.sourceforge.net/peps/pep-0255.html\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
