I am not sure this is the right list or if there should be a list formed specifically for that purpose in order to make it more useful. I do think regardless having a body or some lore on media type design would be really valuable.\n&gt; \n&gt; Back to the question at hand, I find myself struggling with what I lose if the type is not registered.\n\nYou might call it desirable, but it is certainly not required to register media types with IANA to have a working system. There are several non registered types out there today that are being used successfully - and there are also a bunch of registered types that are not being used widely (or at all).\n\nWhat matters is that you are able to find the specification and, maybe more importantly, the community around it. Usually the spec alone is not sufficient to grasp the type, eh?\n\nJan\n\n\n\n&gt; Saying it must be registered implies some big loss. For a proprietary system where I control who the clients are, or I use code on-demand to deploy the user-agent code, why do I care if the type is registered or not?\n&gt; \n&gt; Can you point out exactly what I lose in such a system if I don&#39;t register it.\n&gt; \n&gt; On Sun, Oct 3, 2010 at 7:27 PM, Eric J.

I think that would lead to much better conversations on\n&gt; both lists, resulting in better, more re-usable media types for everyone\n&gt; to choose from (instead of one media type per dialect as per Nathan),\n&gt; encompassing as many problem domains as are already using unregistered\n&gt; identifiers as solutions.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Eric\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
