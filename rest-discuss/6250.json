You can write them into a table before writing out the form, to make\nsure there&#39;s never ever going to be the same string (and not rely on that\ninfinitesimally small chance). \nBut then I realised that this is overblown for my problem. I only need to be\nsure that there&#39;s nothing resent that would trigger an INSERT. As I always\nlog the IP and the creation date, I realised I can simply use microtime\nrelying on the chance that no 2 forms are requested in the same microsecond,\nand extend the creation date field in the database...safe enough in my case.\n\nAnother thing that I haven&#39;t really tested thoroughly is that it seems if\nyou send a form to the server, process it and send a redirect header, you\ndon&#39;t get the little &quot;you have to resend your POST blabla&quot;-box. Maybe. In\nsome browsers. I think. \n\nHope that helps,\nMatthias\n\n\n\n"}}
