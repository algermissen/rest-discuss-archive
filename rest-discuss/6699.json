It seems to be the \n&gt; set of URIs that are outside of web architecture (because the finding covers \n&gt; those inside) and have representations that are not hypermedia (which is \n&gt; kind of funny because by definition such &quot;things&quot; are not in REST).\n\nI’m concerned with all URIs used as URIs. I’m not concerned with URIs\nthat are not used (as when a person thinks of a URI, perhaps writes it,\nbut neither maps the URI to a set representations nor divulges the URI\nto any agent). I’m not concerned with any URI (per RFC 3986, “a compact\nsequence of characters that identifies an abstract or physical\nresource”) that, although used, is not used as a URI (as with the string\n&quot;Jifty::DBI&quot;, which meets the syntactic requirements for URIs per RFC\n3986 and which identifies a resource [a module for the Perl programming\nlanguage]).\n\nThe draft finding on metadata in URIs\n(&lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/metaDataInURI-31-20061016.html&gt;) covers\nURIs in Web architecture. The draft finding and the finding which will\nobsolete it do not define REST. Web architecture and REST are distinct.\nThere is no problem here, and I’m still concerned with the URIs in Web\narchitecture.\n\nThe resources &lt;http://www.w3.org/Icons/w3c_main.png&gt; and\n&lt;http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt&gt; have representations that\nare not hypermedia. Are the resources\n&lt;http://www.w3.org/Icons/w3c_main.png&gt; and\n&lt;http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt&gt; in REST? Are the resources\n&lt;http://www.w3.org/Icons/w3c_main.png&gt; and\n&lt;http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt&gt; in the Web?\n\n&gt; You seem to have your own internal definition of REST that doesn&#39;t map to \n&gt; one that I&#39;m familiar with.\n\nI have an interpretation of the definition of REST, yes.\n\n&gt; We&#39;ve established that you think that Roy and the TAG aren&#39;t any kind of \n&gt; authorities [with regard to] REST\n\nDo you mean “authorities” as agents with great knowledge of a subject?\n(“Michael Jackson is an authority on beer.”)\n\nI mean “authorities” as agents which decide what is and what is not.\n(“Authorities of the Saudi government detained Michael Jackson for\nsneaking a beer into the kingdom.”)\n\nCertainly Roy Fielding and the members of the W3C TAG have great\nknowledge of REST. In cases where “Architectural Styles and the Design\nof Network-based Software Architectures” (starting at\n&lt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm&gt;) uses\nundefined terms or contradicts itself, Roy Fielding is the authority for\nclarifications.\n\nIf it comes to a conflict between what Roy Fielding wrote in his\ndissertation and what he intended, then what he wrote is authoritative\n(that is, defines REST) and what he intended is not authoritative.\n\n&gt; One of the underlying philosophical aspects of REST is that\n&gt; resources and their representations change, and that includes REST itself.\n\nSome resources change. Resources like &lt;data:,Static.&gt; do not and cannot \nchange: “a resource R is a temporally varying membership\nfunction MR(t), which for time t maps to a set of entities, or values,\nwhich are equivalent.” ... “Some resources are static in the sense that,\nwhen examined at any time after their creation, they always correspond\nto the same value set. Others have a high degree of variance in their\nvalue over time. The only thing that is required to be static for a\nresource is the semantics of the mapping, since the semantics is what\ndistinguishes one resource from another.”\n(&lt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_2_1_1&gt;)\n\nRepresentations do not and cannot change: “A representation is a\nsequence of bytes, plus representation metadata to describe those\nbytes.” ... “Metadata is in the form of name-value pairs, where the name\ncorresponds to a standard that defines the value&#39;s structure and\nsemantics.”\n(&lt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_2_1_2&gt;) \n\nAny attempt to change a representation creates a distinction and\ntherefore a separate representation. (See also the discussion on\nwww-tag, starting with\n&lt;http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2006Oct/0007.html&gt;)\n\nThere can be successors to REST — even with the phrase “Representational\nState Transfer” in their names — but REST does not change. There can be \narchitectural styles with the name “Representational State Transfer”. \nReusing the name would not make those architectural styles be REST.\n\n\n"}}
