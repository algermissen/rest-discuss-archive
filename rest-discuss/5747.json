No matter how \nhard you try, you only get back representations of the resource.  What \nmuddies this view is the way in which the web is currently used.  For \ninstance, you place a file on your web server named index.html and \nassign it a URI (/http://example.com/index.html/).  Someone issues a GET \nrequest for that URI and gets back an identical copy of the resource.  \nThis would lead many to the conclusion that index.html is itself the \nresource, and since you get exactly that back (byte-wise) in a GET \nrequest, the representation is effectively the resource itself.  As a \nresult, many conveniently collapse the representation and the resource \ninto one (which we know is not possible in REST).\n\nWhat makes this worse is that we have some conventions (outdated, in my \nopinion) that adds to the confusion.  For instance, if you type in \n/http://example.com/, most servers will look for and return a &quot;default \ndocument&quot; such as /index.html/.  No, it doesn&#39;t redirect the user to \nthat file.  It doesn&#39;t return a representation of its own resource, \nrather it impersonates another resource.  As a result, many consider \n/http://example.com/ and /http://example.com/index.html/ to be one and \nthe same resource (which it isn&#39;t, or else it would have only one URI).  \nIn fact, it is often worse than that, as /http://example.com// will \nusually generate the same result as well.\n\nAnother example is the &quot;/.html/&quot; on the end of \n/http://example.com/index.html/.  Most look at that and figure that they \nare getting back the exact contents of a file on the remote system \ncalled /index.html/.  With this view, the web server is nothing but a \nfile server with a different name.   Further, the web has been a \ndocument-driven tool, historically speaking.  The problem is that this \ncontributes to the lack of strict adherence to the separation of \nresource from representation.\n\nWhen we talk of a website, it is a resource (we have a URI for it).  No, \nit is not an html document.  It is not a document at all.  It is a \nresource.   I do not say &quot;hey, check out my website at \n/http://example.com/index.html/.&quot;  I say &quot;hey, check out my website at \n/http://example.com/&quot;, because that is the URI.  Now, what should \nsomeone expect to get back when issuing a GET against \n/http://example.com/?  Well, first, it depends on what the requester \nunderstands (i.e. what content-types are passed in the /Accept:/ \nheader).  Second, it depends on what content-types the resource can be \nrepresented as.  Third, it depends on what constitutes the meaning of \n&quot;site&quot;.\n\nIs the /index.html/ file on the server part of that?  I would not say \nsay &quot;this page is representing my site&quot;, rather &quot;this is the home page \nof my site&quot;.  As a result, it is appropriate for the file to have its \nown URI (/http://example.com/index.html/).\n\nIs the icon that one might use to place next to the URI in their \nbookmarks part of that?  I would not say &quot;this icon represents the links \non my site&quot;, rather &quot;this icon represents my site.&quot;  As a result, it is \nappropriate to be returned via my site URI (/http://example.com/).\n\nIs the privacy policy (p3p) part of that?  I would not say &quot;this privacy \npolicy represents the all of the other pages on my site&quot;, rather &quot;this \nprivacy policy represents my site&quot;.  As a result, it is appropriate to \nbe returned via my site URI (/http://example.com/).\n\nBut does that mean that /http://example.com/ has no html \nrepresentation?  Maybe, maybe not.  If I could come up with an html \nresponse that represents my site, then I would return it.  Otherwise, I \nwouldn&#39;t.  Of course, given our historical use of the web, not returning \nan html document (or something similar) would be problematic.  Hence the \npopular &quot;default document&quot; approach.  Suppose, however, that I do have \nan html representation of my site (not whatever is in /index.html/).\n\nWe now have at least three different formats that can be returned when \nmaking a request to /http://example.com/.  Which one is returned?  \nSimply the preferred of those available (likely, the html \nrepresentation).  But it is still just one resource.  Not three \nresources.  Not two resources.  Just one.\n\nAnd if you are hung up on the fact that a p3p response does not appear \nto be similar to an icon or html response, think about this:\n\nSuppose we have a resource consisting of the following letter sequence:  \nABCD.  Now, suppose we have three content-types (fictional), such that \nif you do a GET on the URI for this resource for each of the three \ncontent types, you get back the following responses:\n\ncontent-type-a: AB\ncontent-type-b: BC\ncontent-type-c: CD\n\nNow, you could say that AB and BC look similar.  You can say the same \nabout BC and CD.  But what about AB and CD?  These appear to be discrete \nrepresentations.  But we know that they are all representations of the \nsame resource.  Just because they don&#39;t look the same does not mean that \nthey aren&#39;t representations of the same resource.\n\nAnd if you are hung up on the on the question of having two html \nresponses or two icons for the same resource, you can&#39;t.  Think of the \ncontent-type like a filter one might hold up to light.  What you get is \nall that can be represented through that filter, no more or less. The \nhtml response is *the only* html response and the icon is *the only* icon.\n\n\nTo sum it all up, content types (and negotiation) can be used in a \nperfectly RESTful manner.   Further, I think it could improve the \ncurrent state of the web.  However, we are bringing along much baggage, \nwhich makes this difficult.  It also requires people to take on and \nembrace the notion of resources and representations, which I don&#39;t think \nmany are yet willing to do (or are even aware of the possibility).  \nWhether this is because it looks like too much work, or because it&#39;s too \ndifferent, or whatever, is as good your guess as mine.\n\nSeairth\n\r\n--------------040500010001080405030201\r\nContent-Type: text/html;
