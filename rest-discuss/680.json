What if a cache intercepts the method?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; GET doesn&#39;t have side-effects in that case.  The resource doesn&#39;t change\n&gt; &gt; state, plus any other stateful action are undone when the GET finishes.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t follow you. If a GET tells a server to remember to contact me\n&gt; later then how is that not a side-effect. It is a change of server-side\n&gt; state (though not a change of the resource&#39;s state).\n\nOoh, ow, who&#39;s using GET that way?\n\nI&#39;ve only ever suggested using a GET that lasts for a long time.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What if a server just doesn&#39;t understand the header at all? It won&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; announce that.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The &quot;Subscriber&quot; header?  Nope, it won&#39;t announce it, but that&#39;s part of\n&gt; &gt; the Subscription/Subscriber contract.  Why would somebody POST a message\n&gt; &gt; with a Subscriber body to a URI that didn&#39;t advertise its ability to\n&gt; &gt; accept it (and have it mean &quot;subscribe&quot;)?\n&gt; \n&gt; First: you shouldn&#39;t have to know a priori whether a resource is\n&gt; subscribable. You should be able to ask it.\n\nThat&#39;s what the Subscriptions header asserts, no?  It says, &quot;Hi, I\nsupport being subscribed to, and here&#39;s the URI that is a container\nfor all of my subscriptions&quot;.\n\n&gt; Second: having a resource do a completely different type of action based\n&gt; on the contents of the entity body sounds like RPC to me!\n\nHmm, that&#39;s not what I was suggesting.\n\nPOST means &quot;accept&quot;.  If I POST something with a Subscriber header and\nget a 200 back, I know that is was accepted, not that is processed as\na subscription.  It may just have been stored as a file, who knows.\nHow I know that my POST means &quot;subscribe&quot; is because it was asserted\nthat the URI I was posting to was a container for subscriptions.  That&#39;s\nwhat I thought the Subscriptions header was for.
