If I u=\r\nnderstood correctly, I mean.\n&gt;\n&gt; Are you saying I should not name the 4th s=\r\ntyle &#39;REST&#39; but sort of &#39;RESTful use of HTTP&#39; because otherwise I am mixing=\r\n style (REST) and actual architectur (HTTP)?\n&gt;\n\nWell, not quite, I think it=\r\n is REST and you do well in calling it that\nwithout ambiguity. What I was s=\r\naying is that if you constraint other\nprotocols to use the same interface a=\r\ns HTTP, then your analysis apply\nto those other protocols based architectur=\r\nes as well. So it was worth\nmentioning that...\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Besides that, I was e=\r\nxpecting some mention to POX or POX Over HTTP kind of stuff, maybe is worth=\r\n to mention in what category it falls.\n&gt;\n&gt; I do not think it relates to the=\r\n classification, but I agree that it makes sense to tell people sth like &quot;i=\r\nf you do POX+JAXB over HTTP you&#39;ll likely end up with a Type I API&quot;\n&gt;\n\nYes,=\r\n it was in that sense, of pointing as example, that I was referring to.\n\n\n\n=\r\nCheers.\n\n"}}
