Sometimes \nit&#39;s vital to do so to fix a problem.\n\n&gt; I did say &#39;intermediaries&#39; and not &#39;just web proxies&#39;.\n\nIf you&#39;ve a very application aware intermediary, then it already knows \nabout all the relationships between different resources and you don&#39;t \nhave a problem.\n\nIf it doesn&#39;t, then use the way the web has already solved the problem.\n\n&gt; You haven&#39;t explained why it&#39;s necessary to have these URIs in place to \n&gt; deal with this.\n\nBecause you&#39;re whole proposal is only about use-cases where it is \nnecessary to identify the different representations specifically \n(generally none of this is necessary at all).\n\n&gt; Why would you not just return a list of the available content types?\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;10.4.7 406 Not Acceptable\n\nThat is one of the cases I mentioned. 300 is another one I left out by \nmistake; where the server can&#39;t choose between multiple choices of \nentities and prefers to give the choice to the client. In practice this \nis pretty rare.\n\n&gt; presumably &#39;entity characteristics&#39; could refer to available content types?\n\nYes. They could also refer to different language versions. I suppose \nthey could even cover different content-encodings, though all clients \nwould be expected to handle a content-encoding of &quot;none&quot;.\n\n&gt; If the intention is to &#39;let people edit different representations \n&gt; separately&#39; then they aren&#39;t different *representations*; they&#39;re \n&gt; different *resources* and they *should* have different URIs, surely?\n\nThey&#39;re both.\n\nConsider the case where most users are receiving different versions \naccording to content-negotiation, but some users can edit the different \nversions separately (with content-type this may be automated and only \none type need be PUT, but not always, and certainly not with different \nlanguage versions).\n\nIn this case it&#39;s very important to consider the different \nrepresentations as resources. To most users there&#39;s only the one \nresource they are interested in, which has different representations, \nbut to editors there are different resources that relate to that first \nresource.\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t know about perfect, it seems a little long winded compared to my \n&gt; solution which can update all of the representations on the backend \n&gt; without having to send an update for each representation back through \n&gt; the proxy (I assume that was what you meant??).\n\nThe fourth solution web-based is pretty much the same as your only \nsolution. The web&#39;s just flexible enough to deal with other cases beyond \nyours.\n\n&gt; Adding a new representation is an interesting use case; seems like a lot \n&gt; more work with your solution.\n\nHow?\n\nI would PUT it to the URI of the resource.\n\nPossibly I might have use-cases where I wanted to specify handling \nbeyond this, so doing that wouldn&#39;t be the best approach. I may wish to \ncomplicate things to reflect some complication of just what sort of \nhandling I want done. The thing is the web has a simple but flexible \nsolution. It can be as simple as possible, without forcing it to be any \nsimpler.\n\n&gt; I still don&#39;t understand the benefit or necessity of adding these extra \n&gt; URIs - other than the obvious; that you can&#39;t negotiate in browsers any \n&gt; other way at the moment.\n\nYou can negotiate in every mainstream browser right now. It happens.\n\nGo to http://www.google.com/ and there, you&#39;ve just negotiated content \nfrom them. Wasn&#39;t that exciting? It wouldn&#39;t have worked though if you \nfollowed a link with hard-coded decisions by someone else dictating how \nthat content negotiation should take place.\n\n\n"}}
