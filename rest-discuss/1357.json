I see the term\nREST used where a more narrow term would be better - I like &#39;resource\nmodeling&#39; for that.\n\nHere is my suggestion of a direct summary of REST and an explanation that\nthe &#39;information architecture&#39; aspect is mainly what people are talking\nabout.\n\nComments welcome...\n\n-- mike&#39;s summary --\nREST is an architectural style for building large-scale networked\napplications. It is a description of the facets of the WWW that made the Web\nso successful.\nREST describes a networked system in terms of\n - data elements (resource, resource identifier, representation)\n - connectors (client, server, cache, resolver, tunnel)\n - components (server, gateway, proxy, user agent)\n\nData elements are accessed through a standardized interface. Components\ncommunicate by transferring representations of resources through this\ninterface rather than operating directly upon the resource itself.\nConnectors present an abstract interface for component communication, hiding\nthe implementation details of communication mechanisms.\nComponents use connectors to access, provide access or mediate access to\nresources.\nIt is important that intermediaries are an explicit aspect of the\narchitecture.\n\nSince REST is an extracted description of the WWW, it is no suprise that the\nprotocol that exhibits the most number of these aspects is HTTP. However,\nREST and HTTP are separate concepts - it is entirely possible to apply REST\nconcepts to other protocols and systems.\n\nSince most people see the immediate value of components and connectors, most\ndiscussion has been focused on the &#39;information architecture&#39; aspects of\nREST - resources, representations, URIs, standardized interfaces, etc. This\narea is informally known as &#39;resource modeling&#39;. Most examples are framed in\nHTTP messages and URI addressable resources. The theory is that many complex\nsystems can be fully described and implemented with just pure HTTP.\n\n--\n\n\n\n"}}
