A link to a user&#39;s cart would certainly need to have that user&#39;s\n&gt; user-id in the URL and another user trying to access it will either be\n&gt; allowed to see it or not.\n\nRight.\n\nI guess the problem really lies in the general pages with\npersonalization. Since I&#39;ve been poking around a vBulletin\ninstallation this weekend, I&#39;ll go with what&#39;s on my mind (well,\nmostly what&#39;s on my mind after that is &quot;OH MY GOSH YOU&#39;RE DOING\nEVERYTHING WITH GET DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THAT COULD DO&quot; but\nthat&#39;s neither here nor there, though I suppose it might explain why I\nseem to be on such a &quot;ranting about poor UI design&quot; kick today): a web\nforum.\n\nSay you&#39;re displaying a thread. If it&#39;s a logged-in person, you know\nwhich of the posts that person has already seen; if it&#39;s not a\nlogged-in person, you can just say &quot;pretend anything older than N days\nis marked read&quot; and fake it. You don&#39;t want a custom URL for the\nthread, but one little flag on each entry is potentially going to be\ndifferent for different visitors.\n\n&gt; Yuck!\n\nYeah.  It boggles the mind. In cases like this (JoAnn is not the only\noffender; Simplicity doesn&#39;t have direct links to individual sewing\npatterns, another common blog topic) I have been known to manually\nconstruct urls to make requests like &quot;GET\nhttp://www.joann.com/YOUR_USER_INTERFACE_NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT&quot;, often\nfollowed with specific suggestions.\n\nI am pretty sure this is RESTful; I&#39;m using a GET but I can&#39;t,\nunfortunately, depend on the hoped-for side effects...\n\n"}}
