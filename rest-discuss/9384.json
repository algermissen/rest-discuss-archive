Bowman wrote:\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; &gt;Nope. 404 means no representation is available.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; Nope, a 404 response is a representation of the resource&#39;s \n&gt; unavailability.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;I don&#39;t think RFC2616 supports that point of view.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Who&#39;s talking about RFC 2616? REST defines the response to a request as\n&gt; a representation of a resource, even if that representation is an error\n&gt; message, or no conceptual mapping to that resource has been defined.\n\nI am talking about RFC2616. You are using RFC2616. The status code in an \nHTTP/1.1 response is not part of the representation, but a status code.\n\n&gt;  &gt;Well, that&#39;s Rest, not HTTP. I don&#39;t think it will work well to defend a\n&gt;  &gt;funny design using HTTP&#39;s 404/410 distinction with definitions from\n&gt;  &gt;Rest. Unless you can demonstrate the equivalent of 404/410 in Rest, of\n&gt;  &gt;course.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; You require a 410 response to indicate a permanent condition, but I\n&gt; think that means you&#39;re the one who needs to defend his &quot;funny&quot; position\n&gt; on that issue, not me.\n&gt; \n&gt; What do you mean by &quot;demonstrate the equivalent of 404/410 in REST&quot;?\n&gt; If I wish to indicate that a resource is unavailable, either permanently\n&gt; or temporarily, and my distributed hypermedia application uses HTTP as\n&gt; its protocol, then the definitions of the 400, 403, 404 and 410 response\n&gt; codes are used exactly as they are unambiguously described in RFC 2616,\n&gt; at my discretion as the application developer provided that such use\n&gt; doesn&#39;t break the Uniform Interface constraint of REST.\n\nWell, if they&#39;d be &quot;unambiguously described&quot;, I don&#39;t think we would \nhave this discussion.\n\n&gt; ...\n&gt;  &gt;You&#39;re saying &quot;clearly&quot; here, so you can surely quote the spec where it\n&gt;  &gt;supports that? (I&#39;m not completely opposed to that view, but I sure do\n&gt;  &gt;not think that RFC2616 is &quot;clear&quot; about that :-).\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;It is not necessary to mark all permanently unavailable resources as\n&gt; &#39;gone&#39; or to keep the mark for any length of time -- that is left to the\n&gt; discretion of the server owner.&quot; (RFC 2616, 10.4.11)\n\nOK, let&#39;s quote the spec, but completely:\n\n&quot;The requested resource is no longer available at the server and no \nforwarding address is known. This condition is expected to be considered \npermanent. Clients with link editing capabilities SHOULD delete \nreferences to the Request-URI after user approval. If the server does \nnot know, or has no facility to determine, whether or not the condition \nis permanent, the status code 404 (Not Found) SHOULD be used instead. \nThis response is cacheable unless indicated otherwise.\n\nThe 410 response is primarily intended to assist the task of web \nmaintenance by notifying the recipient that the resource is \nintentionally unavailable and that the server owners desire that remote \nlinks to that resource be removed. Such an event is common for \nlimited-time, promotional services and for resources belonging to \nindividuals no longer working at the server&#39;s site. It is not necessary \nto mark all permanently unavailable resources as &quot;gone&quot; or to keep the \nmark for any length of time -- that is left to the discretion of the \nserver owner.&quot;\n\nSo:\n\n- the condition is expected to be permanent, and\n\n- it&#39;s not necessary to *keep* it marked &quot;gone&quot;; but that doesn&#39;t mean \nthe intent is that it can go back to a 2xx.\n\n&gt; ...\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n"}}
