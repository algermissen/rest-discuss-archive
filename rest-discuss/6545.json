It is convenient (why?) to conceptualize every representation, which\n&gt;    causes me to view it as a resource in my model. (still true to REST,\n&gt;    but beginning to lead you astray)\n&gt;\n\nThis is the part of REST which gives me fits, I&#39;ll admit.  Sometimes, all I \nneed is a real-world example, and sometimes a blatant and obvious one is \nright there in front of me and I miss it.  One resource with two \nrepresentations which are not resources themselves, would be a case where an \nXHTML 1.0 page is served as &quot;application/xhtml+xml&quot; to some user-agents and \n&quot;text/html&quot; to others.\n\nOn the server, though, I count four resources:  One unzipped cached output \nstream and one zipped cached output stream in &quot;application/xhtml+xml&quot;, one of \neach of those also for &quot;text/html&quot;.  To a client those are representations, \nsometimes it takes a bit of bludgeoning me about the head to get me to step \nback from my implementation and see these things (also speak of them) in more \ngeneral terms.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;3. Therefore, when you query a resource, I will give you a resource\n&gt;    from some set.  (technically true, but definitely obscuring the basic\n&gt;    REST relation of resource to representation at this point)\n&gt;\n\nI&#39;ve been trying to say that I will give you a representation of some \nresource in the set.  Ultimately the user receives an apple in my example, \nthough, and I have clearly called the apples themselves representations.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Is this helpful?\n&gt;\n\nYes and no.  Yes, it helps me to see where I&#39;m a bit off in my understanding. \nNo, it doesn&#39;t help me with the problem of coming up with a simplified \nexplanation for any of this.  :(\n\n-Eric\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Walden\n&gt;\n&gt;----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;From: &quot;Eric J.
