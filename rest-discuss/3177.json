Alexander Jacobson&quot; &lt;alex@...&gt;\n\n\n&gt; Isn&#39;t adding a query term &quot;received-since&quot; unRESTful?\nI don&#39;t think so. But I am not bothered by constructing URIs on the client.\n\nAlso, I meant &#39;modified-since&#39; - I mis-edited the paragraph before sending\nit. It is intended to represent a resource that is a list of items that have\nbeen modified since a certain time.\n\nIf I understand what you are trying to do, you have a single resource with a\nlist of messages. The content of the response may change somewhere in the\nmiddle - e.g. the href attribute of the fifth item.\nYou would like to talk to this same resource, yet receive only those\nportions (or items) that have changed since some previous response,\nindicated by either eTag or last-modified or something.\nThe change to the resource isn&#39;t that a new message has arrived - you can\nuse the &#39;mark and move&#39; approach to clean out the inbox for that - but that\nthe storage location of attachments has changed.\n\nIf you have multiple collections of messages, then each collection of\nmessages probably needs to support this &#39;list only changed items since xyz&#39;\ncapability.\n\nI can&#39;t help but think that using byte-range is fragile - deltas on dynamic\ncontent seems problematic. I&#39;d recommend a content format that is more\nsuited to having the client merge updates to a list of items.\n\n\nMike\n\n"}}
