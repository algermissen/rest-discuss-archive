Fielding wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; The resource in HTTP is the mapping from the entire identifier\n&gt;&gt;&gt; (including scheme, authority, path, and query) to a set of values.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; For two resources to be the same, they must map to the same set\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of values for all time. There is no way to determine that by\n&gt;&gt;&gt; inspecting the identifiers, aside from scheme-defined equivalence.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I think I get what you are saying, but I want to be sure. Basically\n&gt;&gt; you are\n&gt;&gt; saying that each of the following URLs point to a DIFFERENT\n&gt;&gt; resource as far\n&gt;&gt; as REST is concerned, correct:\n&gt;\n&gt; No.  Why would I have said &quot;For two resources to be the same, ...&quot; if\n&gt; I thought that changing a URI always resulted in different resources?\n&gt; They might be different resources, the client generally won&#39;t be able\n&gt; to figure that out, so the only safe assumption is that they are\n&gt; different resources until stated otherwise by the server.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is Web Architecture.  Resources are an abstraction -- a source of\n&gt; goodness as perceived by the person who linked to that resource that\n&gt; is in the form of a value-giver over time.  There are no resources on\n&gt; the Web -- only senders and receivers of representations that have\n&gt; the effect of evaluating a resource mapping at invocation time,\n&gt; thereby becoming &quot;the resource&quot; as we perceive it over time even\n&gt; though we all know it is just a finite data server at any single\n&gt; point in time.\n\nIf I understand this correctly, the term resource in the REST and  \nHTTP context means a thing of value as perceived by the people using  \nthe system. If all you have is a bunch of URIs, you can&#39;t make any  \nassumptions about whether they refer to the same resource or not. But  \nif you have a bunch of URIs plus more semantic information about the  \nresources they represent, then you can make such assumptions. In that  \ncase, Steve should be OK saying things like:\n\nGET \t/resource \tRetrieve the entire resource.  Query parameters may  \nbe available to retrieve only parts of the resource.\n\nYes, in hindsight perhaps the HTTP spec shouldn&#39;t have said that  \nabout the query parameters. But Steve can declare in his article that  \nfor any system that implements his Entity pattern as he defines it,  \nall URLs that are identical up to the query parameters refer to the  \nsame resource. And in my case, I can say that in my architecture an  \narticle is a resource, and that any article URIs that are identical  \nup to the query parameters refer to the same article resource.\n\nAny objections to that way of treating the term resource?\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nPresident\nArtima, Inc.\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n\n\n"}}
