But robots are stupid. You point them at one web page and they\ntraverse the whole damn web. On the other hand, every watched URI is\nwatched because someone, somewhere explicitly asked to watch it. If\nsomeone set up a robot that FOUND URIs to watch then I would agree it\nshould obey the robots.txt.\n\n&gt; Note that I&#39;m not arguing about what you put in HttpEvents, which is none\n&gt; of my business.\n\nI want you to make it your business. If you see someting I don&#39;t, I want\nto hear about it.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
