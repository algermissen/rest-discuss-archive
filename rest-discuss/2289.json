If\n&gt; the messages is &quot;Yes I agree to the contract at http://..../&quot; then you\n&gt; need http://.../ and you need it as it was at the time the message was\n&gt; sent (a good argument for signed, immutable resources in contractual\n&gt; contexts).\n\nNo, I don&#39;t think you need representations of all the referenced\nresources, at least if you&#39;ve done it right.  Using that example, it\nwould be a mistake to agree to a contract by reference, because the\ncontract may change by the time the message is processed.\n\nThe rule is, if the meaning of the message depends upon the result of\ndereferencing a URI, then this is stateful and a bad thing.\n\nSo while it would be fine to, say, send a list of contracts by URI\nfor the simple purpose of enumerating them, it would not for the\npurpose of agreeing to them.  That&#39;s because in the former case, only\ntheir *identity* contributes to &quot;meaning&quot;, whereas in the latter, their\n*state* contributes to it.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
