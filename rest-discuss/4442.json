The representation will\n&gt; be used in at least two ways: 1) as templates of requests that are\n&gt; used to delegate an activity selected by some precondition -- the\n&gt; actual request might be generated by some XML processing chain based\n&gt; on that template and visible workflow state; and 2) as journels of\n&gt; the request and the response intended to provide inspectable state\n&gt; as a workflow evolves.\n&gt;\n&gt; E.g.,\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;http&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;request method=&quot;...&quot; requestURL=&quot;...&quot; version=&quot;HTTP/1.1&quot;&gt;\n&gt;      &lt;header name=&quot;host&quot;&gt;...&lt;/header&gt;\n&gt;      ...\n&gt;      &lt;entity xlink:href=&quot;...&quot; xlink:type=&quot;resource|locator&quot;&gt;\n&gt;      ...\n&gt;      &lt;/entity&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;/request&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;response statusCode=&quot;...&quot; reasonLine=&quot;...&quot; version=&quot;HTTP/1.1&quot;&gt;\n&gt;      &lt;header name=&quot;Content-Type&quot;&gt;...&lt;/header&gt;\n&gt;      ...\n&gt;      &lt;entity xlink:href=&quot;...&quot; xlink:type=&quot;resource|locator&quot;&gt;\n&gt;      ...\n&gt;      &lt;/entity&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;/response&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/http&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The notion is that the request/response entity is optional (since\n&gt; it is not always present) and that it may either be represented\n&gt; inline or as a link to a resource whose representation is that\n&gt; entity.  In particular, this seems to be a better way to store\n&gt; a transaction journel or record the evolving state of requests\n&gt; and responses on some evolving workflow state.\n&gt;\n&gt; This sort of thing is relatively straightforward, but it seems like\n&gt; it could be useful in a lot of places, e.g., a transaction log for\n&gt; a REST repository, so I was wondering if there has been any effort\n&gt; to develop such an XML vocabulary and whether or not it might\n&gt; generalize out of the specific use case for which it was developed.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; -bryan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
