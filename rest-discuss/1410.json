You can&#39;t look up what it means\n&gt; anywhere.\n\nLet me see if I understand what you are saying Mark: if the HTTP header\ncontains information (e.g., cookie information) that is used by the\nserver application then that is not RESTful.  However, if we were to\nmove the (e.g., cookie) information into the HTTP message body, then it\nwould be RESTful.  Is that it?  That doesn&#39;t seem reasonable since the\nHTTP header contains a lot of information that a server application will\ntypically use, such as the content type that the client will accept\n(e.g., text/html), and many other things.  These HTTP headers induces\nbehaviour in the server application.  Taking this argument to its\nlogical conclusion, then I conclude that no HTTP message can ever be\nRESTful, unless it has no HTTP headers, since HTTP headers by their very\nnature induces behaviour in the server application.  Yes?\n\nTo restate my earlier question: what exactly does it mean to be\nstateless?  In light of the above, does it mean that all information is\ncarried in the HTTP message body?  That is, the server application&#39;s\nbehaviour is not influenced by anything in the HTTP header?\n\nSorry to be so dense on this.  However, I feel that it is a critical\nissue that I want to make certain I fully understand as I go out into\nthe world to preach the merits of REST.  /Roger\n\n\n"}}
