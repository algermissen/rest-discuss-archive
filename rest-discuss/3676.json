This violates the semantics of your access\n&gt; &gt; control check.\n&gt;\n&gt; No, you could be said to be delegating access to the representation, but\n&gt; not the resource; whilst the representation is available to anyone who is\n&gt; able to observe it as it goes by, other representations of the resource\n&gt; are not available to them upon demand without the proper credentials.\n\nIn this case, access to a representation of the resource is\nequivalent to access to the resource. We know this because Seairth\nis specifically asking about a resource for which caching is\nimportant. Given this information, your suggestion to use digest\nauthentication to &quot;maintain the privacy of the authenticator&quot;\ndoesn&#39;t make any sense.\n\nEven if you wish to quibble over the above, it doesn&#39;t change the\nfact that you&#39;ve violated the semantics of the access control\ncheck. The requestor intends to fetch a representation for\nhimself, not himself and everyone in the neighborhood.\n\nDoes it seem odd to anyone that I am needing to argue that it is\nimportant to encrypt private data before transmitting it over a\npublic network?\n\n&gt; &gt; In this case, using HTTP Auth without SSL doesn&#39;t provide any\n&gt; &gt; actual security. I don&#39;t know how knowledgeable you are about\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;security&quot; is such an imprecise term, isn&#39;t it?\n\nNot in this context it isn&#39;t. Context is always important in\nEnglish.\n\nTyler\n\n"}}
