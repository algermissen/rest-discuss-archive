Do you think REST is a reasonable alternative to \nCORBA, EJB, RMI and SOAP for some/many distributed applications? Of course \nthere are considerations like performance, security and transaction handling \nto be dealt with. But on the plus side, I really like the simplicity of \nREST, being able to easily pass any XML and get any XML back ... defined by \nsome type of schema. I&#39;m getting the impression though that most people see \nthis as a fringe use of REST. True?\n\n\n\n"}}
