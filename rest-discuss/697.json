But the client supposedly doesn&#39;t\ncare (&quot;much&quot;) about a page counter. A notification is extremely\nimportant to the client. So it is a relevant side effect IMO.\n\nI also think that Lucas makes a good point about third-party watchers.\nAn explicit subsription model supports that.\n\nOn the other hand, we could probably steal the idea of one-shot\nnotifications. There may be virtue in elevating that whole subscription\nexpiry crap to the application level. With each notification you attempt\nto re-subscribe and if it ever fails, it fails. The application should\nknow why that might happen. Then Lucas doesn&#39;t get bogged down into\ntrying to design a query language for the union of temporal and\nnumerical expiries.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
