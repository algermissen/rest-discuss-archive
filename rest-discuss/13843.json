Orde=\r\nrs can be created, updated, paid, completed, cancelled etc.\n\nCreating an or=\r\nder seems straightforward: POST a description of the order to some Orders c=\r\nollection, and perhaps PUT some further details at the URL of the new order=\r\n. But now suppose we want to update the order - to confirm that it has been=\r\n paid, and that the ordered items should now be shipped.\n\nComing from an OO=\r\nP perspective, it feels as if we would like to send a &quot;complete&quot; message to=\r\n the Order object. But &quot;complete&quot; is not a bit of order state - it&#39;s an ins=\r\ntruction to some system to change the state of an order and make sure a num=\r\nber of side-effects are taken care of into the bargain.\n\nI&#39;ve seen one purp=\r\nortedly &quot;RESTful&quot; interface, that has operations like this:\n\nPOST &gt; /Orders=\r\n/Ord001/Complete\n\n{\n    shipping: &quot;express&quot;\n}\n\n- but this seems wrong (&quot;com=\r\nplete&quot; is a verb, not a noun). Another option might be this:\n\nPOST &gt; /Order=\r\ns/Ord001\n\n{\n    cmd: &quot;complete&quot;,\n    shipping: &quot;express&quot;\n}\n\n- which seems r=\r\neasonable, but is still a bit more like RMI than feels quite right.\n\nThe th=\r\nird option I&#39;ve considered is to say that an Order has associated with it a=\r\n Completion form, which one can fill in and submit by POSTing to it. Here, =\r\na GET to the Order might return a completion-uri (amongst other order detai=\r\nls), and we might POST our shipping options to that URI to get the Order co=\r\nmpleted. But now we are updating the state of one resource (the Completion =\r\nform) in order to set in progress a chain of side-effects that will include=\r\n the updating of another resource (the Order itself). It seems a little for=\r\nced, compared to the RMI-ish example.\n\nIs there any really RESTful alternat=\r\nive I haven&#39;t considered?\n\nBest wishes,\nDominic Fox\n\n\n"}}
