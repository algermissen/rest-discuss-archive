What I think you are saying\n&gt; is that there should as of yet be no client software that attempts to\n&gt; construct a URL based on server-provided protocols because there isn&#39;t a\n&gt; currently &quot;specified&quot; way of doing it (I quoted &quot;specified&quot; because I think\n&gt; you meant that there is no current &quot;specification&quot; such as an RFC that\n&gt; establishes a way to do this.)  Is that what you meant?\n\nTo clarify: I&#39;m am not saying that there *should* be no clients that\nconstruct URIs.\n\nThat would be a very odd position to take - indeed, I have written\nmany such clients myself.\n\n&gt; If no, please help me understand.\n\nMy point is that I expect the purpose of a URI Template specification\nis to enable a *general* client implementation rather than a series of\nclient-specific implementations.\n\nThink of Atom/RSS feeds. There is now a generally-accepted practice of\nspecifying a link to  available feeds from within an html document,\ne.g.\n\n&lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;application/rss+xml&quot; title=&quot;RSS Feed&quot;\nhref=&quot;http://example.com/feed.rss&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;application/atom+xml&quot; title=&quot;Atom Feed&quot;\nhref=&quot;http://example.com/feed.atom&quot; /&gt;\n\nBecause of this, browsers such as IE7 and FF2 have a general\nimplementation for Feed Discovery. No site-specific logic is required.\n\nThe downside with the IE7 / FF2 solutoin is that it is an\nhtml-specific approach. It offers no solution for non-html\ncontent-types. I believe it would be better to establish practices\nthat are less content-type-specific.\n\n&gt; If yes, then I would rhetorically ask &quot;How then do things because a\n&gt; specification?&quot; to which I&#39;d answer that I understand that they become\n&gt; specifications by first having a least two implementations.  And if I&#39;m\n&gt; correct in that then your position impedes the beneficial URI Templates from\n&gt; more quickly gaining the foothold it needs based on a principle that URI\n&gt; Templates would nullify.  Said another way, rather than taking a position to\n&gt; minimize functionality based on a principle wouldn&#39;t it be better to provide\n&gt; one of those implementations that URI Templates needs to actually become the\n&gt; specification that we currently lack?\n\nMy hope is to stimulate discussion and potentially start building some\nconsensus to proceed forward. I&#39;m certainly not trying to be a barrier\nto progress :-)\n\nAlan\n\n"}}
