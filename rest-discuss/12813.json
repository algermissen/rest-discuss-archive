Usually these\ntypes of transactions happened within the same namespace against local\nresources. There were a few cases where the transactions involved remote\nservers and that was handled by modeling the action as a local transaction\nanyway. All these items were in the range of a few seconds or less.\n\nIn cases where I was in the position to control the details, I found Sagas\n(including the option of forward and backward recovery) more appealing and,\nfor me, easier to implement over HTTP than provisional-final. At the time I\nlearned this I was working with transactions that could take minutes even\nmore than an hour to sort out all parties. Often it meant working out\ndetails of alternate resolutions (hence the appeal of forward recovery\nmodeling) and/or could mean offering clients the opportunity to resubmit\nwork using alternate data. Sagas made that relatively easy to do w/o the\nneed for locking resources along the way.\n\nCan you point me to some refs on provisional-final implementations? I&#39;d be\nhappy to look at them again.\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\n\n\n\nOn Sun, Jun 7, 2009 at 10:30, Bob Haugen &lt;bob.haugen@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; On Sun, Jun 7, 2009 at 9:25 AM, mike amundsen &lt;mamund@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; If you have a model where undo is not an option, Saga won&#39;t be of much\n&gt; use.\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve run into this very often, but it happens.
