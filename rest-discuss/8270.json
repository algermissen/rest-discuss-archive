However, quick research on the net s=\r\nuggests that IE, for \ninstance, can&#39;t accommodate more than 2083 characters=\r\n. I&#39;m inclined to \nbelieve that 2083 characters (not bytes) essentially is =\r\nthe limit of \nstate information that can be included in RESTful request. \nI=\r\nn reality, the real limit is even lower due to URLencoding \nrequirements.\n\n=\r\nAny thoughts or comments are highly appreciated and welcomed!\n\nCheers,\nHovh=\r\nannes Tumanyan\n\n\n\n"}}
