They want to be able to\n&gt; say don&#39;t send me these nodes, only go this deep with those nodes,\n&gt; etc. So, in essence, they want to personalize the representation.\n\nI don&#39;t think it&#39;s helpful to think of this as a personalisation. \nPersonalisation means &quot;give me this the way I like it.\n\nThis is more &quot;give me this as follows&quot;.\n\n&gt; Option 3 seems the slickest but I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s as RESTful as I\n&gt; think it is.\n\nI agree. It&#39;s not so much non-RESTful as not taking as much potential \nadvantage of REST as the other two.\n\n&gt; Has anyone else had to deal with unusually large representations that\n&gt; need to be trimmed down on a client by client basis?\n\nYes, and I&#39;ve used both option 1 and 2 where they seemed useful.\n\n&gt; Personally, I&#39;d\n&gt; rather avoid the whole issue and add more hierarchy to the URI space\n&gt; and have the clients act a little less dumb.\n\nI wouldn&#39;t recommend so much more hierarchy as more resources in a \nlarger URI space - that may very well fit in with more hierarchy, but \nI&#39;d consider how hierarchical things are to be another question.\n\nIf http://example.com/v1/foo/{id} consists of links to representations \nof the &quot;nodes&quot; rather than full information on them then the client can \ndecide which items are of interest to it.\n\nAny RESTful design (whether human-readable or machine-readable) contains \na tension between the advantages and disadvantages of putting every \navailable piece of information into a single representation (in \nhuman-readable applications that would be a one-page website) and of \nsplitting everything out as finely as possible. We strive to find \nnatural &quot;lumps&quot; of information. If your problem is that your lumps are \nlarge, then you may just need more smaller lumps. The advantages are \ngreater if some of the finer grains are shared between more than one of \nthe larger &quot;lumps&quot; you have now, since this magnifies the advantages of \ncaching (both the caching inherent to REST and the possibility of \nclients caching the objects they create when parsing).\n\n\n"}}
