I can do whatever I want with the\n&gt;&gt; origin server, but REST constrains the behavior of the\n&gt;&gt; _connector_ that origin server uses to communicate with the\n&gt;&gt; outside world.\n&gt;\n&gt;Citation please. I disagree that there is any part of REST which\n&gt;imposes any particular behaviour on the server.\n&gt;\n\n&quot;Server&quot; means both the origin server component, and the server \nconnector.  REST dictates that the server connector meets the \ngeneric interface constraint, meaning the server connector must \nbehave in a very specific way that may be generically understood \nby clients as well as intermediary caches.  REST also dictates \nthat the origin server manage the namespace in such a way that \nthe semantics of the mappings are static.\n\n&quot;An origin server uses a server connector to govern the namespace for \na requested resource. It is the definitive source for representations \nof its resources and must be the ultimate recipient of any request that \nintends to modify the value of its resources. Each origin server \nprovides a generic interface to its services as a resource hierarchy. \nThe resource implementation details are hidden behind the interface.&quot;\n\nI would say that the failure to impose either of two behaviors on the \nserver breaks REST.  One, REST requires that the semantics of the \nmappings on the server do not change, and two, REST requires that the \nserver connector use a generic interface.  Those two implementation \ndetails can&#39;t be hidden behind the interface, they _are_ the \ninterface.  There are no constraints as to how an application can \nachieve these two required behaviors, as those details remain hidden.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
