The\nclient in this context isn&#39;t a web browser but instead a java application.\nOne argument in favor of SOAP is that the java toolkits, client and server,\nare pretty good, while with RESTful HTTP, the server toolkits are pretty\ngood while clients aren&#39;t so much.\n\nDo y&#39;all buy this argument? Can anyone recommend a very good HTTP client\nfor RESTful application development in java?\n\n- donald\n\n\n"}}
