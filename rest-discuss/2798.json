For some it means &quot;use \nexisting Internet infrastructure&quot;. For others it means &quot;use few methods, \nwhether they are HTTP&#39;s or not.&quot; For others it means &quot;use lots of URIs.&quot;\n\nIf people are thinking about the issues enough to misunderstand them, \nthat&#39;s at least progress. ;)\n\nI&#39;m somewhat confused about how the RESTful SOAP Groove thing will work. \nFirst, I wonder how they will work around the well-known problems in \nusing service URIs in WSDL. Second, I wonder why they would use a READ \nmethod instead of the GET method embedded in the implementations of \nhundreds of tools and standards, from Xalan to Squid, XPath to the DOM.\n\nMy guess is that the answers to those questions are linked. They \ncouldn&#39;t use HTTP GET because WSDL has such poor support for REST. I \nwould guess they&#39;ve built a REST-a-like on top of a standard \nsingle-endpoint SOAP services. I would guess that the addressing model \nis *still* broken into domain/port/service-path and resource-path \nwhereas the Web has domain/port/resource-path. The \nservice-path/resource-path split is still proprietary, just as if \nresource-path was using some kind of proprietary GrooveIDs. And of \ncourse the method names and semantics are still proprietary to Groove.\n\nIf we all do this then we will end up with hundreds of incompatible \nweb-alikes.\n\nI understand the position Groove is in: they have to ship software and \ncan&#39;t wait until WSDL is fixed. And they have to demo Visual Studio.NET \nintegration so they can&#39;t dump WSDL. Maybe they did the right thing from \na marketing and sales point of view.\n\nBut nevertheless, fans of &quot;RESTful SOAP&quot; should get out there and \npublicize the problems with WSDL so that they will be fixed one day. It \nwould be really tragic if five years from now that the REST acronym is \nassociated with a design pattern that has been deployed in hundreds of \nincompatible ways in hundreds of incompatible services.\n\nThese issues are discussed further here:\n\n  * http://www.blogstream.com/pauls/1032521623/index_html\n  * http://www.prescod.net/rest/wsdlhttp.html\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
