If a client knows about\n&gt; &quot;commands&quot; and where to send them in advance, you loose the values you get\n&gt; by giving URIs to things.\n\nThe client does need some comprehension of the fact that there are\nmultiple links that can be followed to indicate the different reasons\nfor changing an address.  I agree that the client does not need to\nknow that the two Urls will be mapped to different commands, just that\nthe distinction must start at the client.\n\n\n&gt; From my understanding of the scenario you propose, where a client needs to\n&gt; initiate a command it knows about, where the interaction is inside the\n&gt; message and opaque to intermediaries, one cannot &quot;do CQS with REST&quot; because\n&gt; one would be breaking ReST constraints.\n&gt;\nI think the problem is more a case of my poor choice of language than\nme proposing that a client needs to know about commands.\n\nThanks for the clarification, I understand much better where you are\ncoming from,\n\nDarrel\n\n"}}
