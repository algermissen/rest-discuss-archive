Namely:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; - What do you think of the idea of having an interface definition\n&gt;  &gt; language for REST services ? It seems some people outright reject the\n&gt;  &gt; idea, while others support it in the form of WADL.\n&gt;  &gt; It seems to me something like that would be nice to have, allowing for\n&gt;  &gt; example Yahoo, Google and Microsoft to agree on a unified API for\n&gt;  &gt; searches, that would be published using the IDL of choice. Client\n&gt;  &gt; could then switch fairly easily from an implementation to another.\n&gt;  &gt; Which leads to my second question...\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  http://bitworking.org/news/193/Do-we-need-WADL\n\nWell, this makes a case against WADL, based on\n- experience with WSDL showing that people will want to generate code from it\n- the fact that current schema description languages are not adequate\n...all implementation issues, however important, IMHO.\n\nOn the other hand, the OpenSearch format definitely is an IDL. It&#39;s a\ndomain-specific IDL. So what ? It&#39;s a different implementation of the\nsame basic idea. Now it may make a lot more sense to have narrower,\ndomain-specific IDLs like that : it may make capturing semantics\neasier, and users of a search service are not going to switch to a\nstockquote service without changing their code anyway.\n\nNow comes the question : how does the domain-specific IDLs fit with\nthe idea of having forms as IDLs ? As I see it, forms as IDLs are just\na layer of indirection, while an full fledged IDL document may give\nmore infomation. But maybe more information isn&#39;t needed.\n\n&gt;  &gt; - Is there any ongoing attempt at establishing a standard for service\n&gt;  &gt; registries ? If we were to have that kind of domain-specific\n&gt;  &gt; standardized services, it would probably be interesting to have\n&gt;  &gt; registries of interesting service interfaces along with running\n&gt;  &gt; implementations. Which could be automatically tested for liveness by\n&gt;  &gt; the registry, possibly using information from the IDL (testing\n&gt;  &gt; published resources actually are there and respond to advertised\n&gt;  &gt; verbs, etc).\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  We have one failed approach (with UDDI) already; not sure why we&#39;d\n&gt;  need another one.\n&gt;  For enterprisey (governance) aspects, some thoughts here:\n&gt;  http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/2007/07/26/governance_and_rest.html\n\nInteresting. But I was more thinking about the public Web here, where\nhaving a starting point to get to service implementations could be\nmore valuable that within a single entreprise (where you now more or\nless what is up and running).\n\n-- \nOlivier Pernet\n\nWe are the knights who say\necho &#39;16i[q]sa[ln0=aln100%Pln100/snlbx]sbA0D4D465452snlbxq&#39;|dc\n\n"}}
