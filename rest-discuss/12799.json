Now we have the style of a style? I.e, REST is\nsubstyle of the hypermedia style?\n\nSo I went back to the thesis to see how you defined *hypermedia* only to\ndiscover that you don&#39;t. AFAICT there is only one definition constraining *\nhypermedia* in your thesis: *Hypermedia is defined **by** the presence of\napplication control information embedded within, or as a layer above, the\npresentation of information.* (I notice that assertion is not footnoted.)\n\nThis sentence really doesn&#39;t help since it uses the phrase *defined **by* not\n*defined **as. *Thus, the sentence doesn&#39;t say what hypermedia is, it merely\nimposes a constraint on the concept of hypermedia -- whatever it may be.\nNowhere in the thesis is hypermedia (style) ever cited or defined. Or is\nhypermedia not a style but the single architectural constraint provided by\nthe quoted sentence? All this kind of makes it a moving target.\n\n[Current debate aside, I&#39;d be really interested to hear your definition of\nhypermedia, or even just see some pointers to others&#39; definitions that\ndefine it as an interaction style. All the definitions I&#39;ve ever seen define\nhypermedia &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia&gt; as a kind of media.\nEven Ted Nelson defined hypermedia as simply the\nmedium&lt;http://www.scribd.com/doc/454074/A-File-Structure-for-the-Complex-The-Changing-And-the-Indeterminate&gt;,\nnot the style.]\n*\n*\n*All that being said, my argument still holds. Even if hypermedia is defined\nas an interaction style (or something like a style) as opposed to a\nparticular kind of media (data), a style is no more an engine than a set of\nHTML documents is an engine.\n\nTo support this claim, let me quote further from the paragraph in which the\nabove quoted sentence appears (4.1.3):\n\n*\n\n*Hypermedia is defined by the presence of application control information\nembedded within, or as a layer above, the presentation of information.\nDistributed hypermedia allows the presentation and control information to be\nstored at remote locations. By its nature, **user actions within a\ndistributed hypermedia system require the transfer of large amounts of data*\n* from where the data is stored to where it is used.*\n\n*\nYet again, we see that it is user actions (powered by the browser software)\nthat singled out as driving the application (&quot;user actions ... require the\ntransfer of ... data&quot;) -- the system does not drive itself.\n\nSaying that hypermedia (the entire system or style) is the engine is like\nsaying the entire automobile (or the architectural style called\n&quot;automobile&quot;) is the engine. It may be true in a Zen-like way (and believe\nme, I LOVE mystical philosophies), but it is utterly confusing to 99% of\nhumanity.\n\nIt is far clearer to the rest of humanity to say that the browser (or more\ngenerally user agent) is the engine of state, the user is the driver of\nstate, and hypermedia is the representation of state.\n\n-- Nick\n\n*\n\r\n--000e0cd28bfc2dc694046baba4ea\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nOn Sat, Jun 6, 2009 at 3:42 AM, Roy T.
