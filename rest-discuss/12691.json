I have had m=\r\nuch good input \n&gt; from the discussions here so far, but one thing I need he=\r\nlp with.\n&gt; \n&gt; Basically, I want the application to use Command and Query se=\r\nparation at \n&gt; its root. This means that clients call queries to get state/=\r\nviews out, \n&gt; then perform commands on that which are sent back to the serv=\r\ner. In \n&gt; other words, clients never ever send state back, only commands. S=\r\no far I \n&gt; have resources in my URI structure for the queries, which can be=\r\n GET, \n&gt; and that works quite ok, but then I also have the commands in my U=\r\nRI \n&gt; structure, such as:\n&gt; /user/123/inbox/createtask\n&gt; which when GET ret=\r\nurns an empty JSON structure or HTML form, which can \n&gt; then be filled in a=\r\nnd POST&#39;ed back. There is a domain model on the \n&gt; server which interprets =\r\nand executes this and all the domain logic \n&gt; around it.\n&gt; \n&gt; But from my r=\r\neading of the &quot;RESTful web services&quot; this corresponds to \n&gt; the REST/RPC hy=\r\nbrid architecture. It is difficult, at best, to do \n&gt; caching of resources,=\r\n since there is no POST/PUT/DELETE which explicitly \n&gt; could be used to inv=\r\nalidate resource caches, such as that of \n&gt; /user/123/inbox. Using lastmodi=\r\nfied/etags for caching works though.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does anyone have experience build=\r\ning CQS-systems that have a more \n&gt; RESTful approach? How are others dealin=\r\ng with this?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;    Rickard\n\nJust writing to confirm that I use =\r\nthe approach you are talking about.  Where your domain model goes, be it cl=\r\nient or server, is not REST vs. RPC.  It is a federation problem.  If your =\r\nweb app&#39;s client portion is object-oriented and in the same trust domain as=\r\n the server, and the communication channel is secure, then your model can e=\r\nxist on the client.  Your protocol still needs to be able to handle failure=\r\n, though, and you need to think of what tolerances you need before you desi=\r\ngn the API.\n\nCaching is part of layering, too.\n\nAs an aside, I&#39;ve never see=\r\nn anyone debate CQS vs. REST before.  I remember bringing up CQS to Stefan =\r\nTilkov as a basic REST pattern (Jul 12, 2008), and he commented that he tot=\r\nally forgot about CQS.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
