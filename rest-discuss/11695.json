But the benefit of the wiki page is  \nthat it&#39;s malleable and can morph over time while preserving the  \noriginal URI and therefore any references issued to it.\n\nThat said, a wiki page is a terrible place to have a discussion.   \nThat&#39;s what page comments or mailing lists are for.\n\n&gt; Maybe this is partly why the\n&gt; http://restpatterns.org/ wiki hasn&#39;t seen significant acceptance (not\n&gt; intended to be a loaded word but another doesn&#39;t jump to mind). The\n&gt; other side of the wiki question may be that people regard their blogs\n&gt; as the right place to publish stuff that they author.\n\nYes, that&#39;s one of the problems.  Everybody wants to be the next Jesse  \nJames Garret and only publish knowledge on their blog so they can  \nclaim credit for it.  As long as that mentality persists, there is not  \ngoing to be a collective reference, which is a loss for all of us,  \nimo.  Alternatively, once an idea has evolved enough from a personal  \nblog into a piece of insight, why not re-publish it on the wiki site  \nwith a link on this mailing list for all to know about?\n\nThe other problem is that there has been no effort put into focusing  \nour collective capabilities.  If we wanted to pool together our  \nknowledge, we could get organized easily.  Question is, who is willing  \nto participate?\n\n&gt; So, how do we serve beginners better? I imagine that we all want those\n&gt; who seek to on-board to REST to be facilitated in doing so.\n\n\nI&#39;m all for serving beginners better, but I suspect if a new list were  \nstarted, only the first few posters would be well served while the  \nnovelty of the new mailing list is still fresh.  As the same questions  \ncome up again, the responses to them will become shorter and shorter.\n\nA great example of this was the recent response of using an Accept  \nheader to influence the representation sent by the browser rather than  \nto use ?format=XML or /xml in the URI.  The response was accurate, but  \nwithout further context, rather useless.\n\nHow long until the new mailing list for beginners will end up in the  \nsame spot?  If we don&#39;t capture the outcome of long discussions, we&#39;re  \neither bound to repeat them or we&#39;ve only helped ourselves.\n\n- Steve\n\n--------------\nSteve G.
