That may explain weirdnesses I see on a  \n&gt; couple of sites. I&#39;ll have to check.\n&gt;\nI&#39;m not sure, because I never tried it, but that has been my impression.\n\n&gt; As a user, that would really annoy me. In practice I avoid sites  \n&gt; where autocomplete doesn&#39;t work, and I suspect others do similarly.  \n&gt; The only two I&#39;ll use are my ISP&#39;s and the Brooklyn Public  \n&gt; Library&#39;s because these sites&#39; unique value is high enough that I  \n&gt; can put up with some hassle (and I am thinking about changing ISPs).\n&gt;\n&gt; If I were programming a browser or form autofill plugin (and I may  \n&gt; in fact be doing that in the not too distant future) I&#39;d make a  \n&gt; point of disabling that behavior. If I used the site on a regular  \n&gt; basis, I might write a GreaseMonkey script to fix this brokenness.  \n&gt; In fact, now that i think of it, I think I&#39;ll do exactly that for  \n&gt; the two sites that are bothering me like this.\n&gt;\nI think I&#39;m beginning to see where you&#39;re coming from when you think  \nthe client should be in control of auth sessions. You know you&#39;re  \nlogging in from your browser on your laptop, so why are these sites  \nalways asking for your password again? It slows you down and is a  \nusability minus for the site because it is annoying. The reason they  \nare doing it is that people less sophisticated than you sometimes  \nleave themselves logged in at public computers, and in very rare  \ncases, people may hijack sessions because the site is using cookie  \nauth. Because of other people&#39;s potential bad behavior and this  \ndefect in cookie auth, which the site decided to use, the site makes  \nyou suffer by forcing you to reenter your password over and over.\n\nWhile we&#39;re talking about user-friendliness, I was just looking  \naround the web for RBAC info, and I came across this page:\n\nhttp://hissa.nist.gov/rbac/cals-paper.html\n\nWierd timing, because it popped up an auth dialog after rendering the  \ntext of the page. It says, &quot;Enter username and password for &#39;FW-1.  \nReason: no user FW-1 &#39; at 129.6.92.1:80&quot;, asks me for a User Name and  \nPassword, and gives me a Cancel and OK button. (This is on Firefox on  \nMac OS X.) I have no idea why I need to give credentials to read this  \narticle, the top part of which I can actually already read. Plus I  \ndon&#39;t have credentials, and when I press Cancel the dialog comes back  \nagain. I could find no way to get out of this loop short of quiting  \nFirefox. Is this HTTP auth? Whatever it is, I find it decidedly  \nunfriendly.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nEditor-in-Chief\nArtima Developer\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n"}}
