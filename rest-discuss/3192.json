I would agree that, for example, an SMTP\n&gt; message isn&#39;t visible to an HTTP intermediary.  But there&#39;s shared\n&gt; knowledge on application semantics in the HTTP/HTTP case.\n\nIf the _whole_ content of the application and it&#39;s semantics can be \nderived from RFC 2616, then yes. HTTP semantics are visible to HTTP \nintermediaries.\n\nBut as acres of earlier mail should have made clear, I don&#39;t believe \nthat the semantics of Web services can be fully captured at the level \nof HTTP.\n\nLet&#39;s face it, HTTP isn&#39;t even enough for plain hypertext ... the HTML \nREC isn&#39;t an appendix of RFC 2616 ;-)\n\nCheers,\n\n\nMiles\n\n----- End forwarded message -----\n\n-- \nMark Baker.
