At the end the answer is usually it supports RPC, which is not the c=\r\nase lately. Actually, it never was, as document style services should be th=\r\ne ones to use. Oh, well.\n\nWhy is WSDL needed? To describe the actual servic=\r\ne consumption process. Where do we find the service? Where do we find the d=\r\nocument format we need to send or expect to receive? Where do we find the m=\r\nessage send a receive pattern? It is there, in the WSDL.\n\nNow, REST allows =\r\nthat flow to be discovered, rather than written in one place. Ian&#39;s descrip=\r\ntion of the use of XForms achieves that, so they are similar in the goal, m=\r\nay not be so similar in the process. Both will required some out-of-band in=\r\nformation. XForms is not forcing the POST method, actually. Is is a way to =\r\ndescribe the expected data in a known format, reducing coupling. You may la=\r\nter change the XFORM given some data for the request is changed, and nothin=\r\ng breaks (as a matter of fact, with WSDL should happen the same, but people=\r\n use compile time binding, stubs, that break that possibility). \n\nThat said=\r\n, I think the benefit of this form is it avoid, at least a little, the earl=\r\ny binding that WADL or WSDL have. So, you are creating totally dynamic clie=\r\nnts instead of static ones, pre-build with stubs and things like that. Ther=\r\ne is still one problem to solve, though, the semantics of the data fields i=\r\nn the Form. But that should be managed as a pre defined context, with a gen=\r\neral, agreed upon, glossary.\n\nCheers.\n\nWilliam Martinez Pomares. \n\n--- In r=\r\nest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, J=F8rn Wildt &lt;jw@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I was reading=\r\n Ian Robinsons &quot;Using typed links to forms&quot; (again, it&#39;s a good \n&gt; read) at=\r\n http://iansrobinson.com/2010/09/02/using-typed-links-to-forms/. \n&gt; Here he=\r\n introduces the idea of adding XForms to a link relation, such that \n&gt; inst=\r\nead of having only:\n&gt; \n&gt;   &lt;link rel=3D&quot;&quot; type=3D&quot;&quot; href=3D&quot;&quot; title=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; and document out of band how to post data to that link, one could have =\r\nan \n&gt; XForm at the end of the link and then use that information as the \n&gt; =\r\nonline/inline/in-band documentation. I think that&#39;s quite a neat idea, but =\r\n\n&gt; it strikes me that it&#39;s getting awfull close to a WSDL spec.\n&gt; \n&gt; Both X=\r\nForm and WSDL defines how to POST data adhering to a specific XML \n&gt; schema=\r\n. If you then add a list of links to XForms, the list would be much \n&gt; like=\r\n the WSDL list of methods/messages. The rel=3D&quot;&quot; types would specify WSDL \n=\r\n&gt; message names.\n&gt; \n&gt; In all we could  have an HTML 5 list like the one bel=\r\now and call it the WSDL \n&gt; method list:\n&gt; \n&gt;   &lt;dl&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;&quot; t=\r\nype=3D&quot;&quot; href=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;Title&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;dd&gt;Description&lt;/dd&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;/dl&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Each of the achors then points to an XForm which in turn points to an XML =\r\n\n&gt; schema definition and defines POST urls - just like WSDL does.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is t=\r\nhis good or bad? Is it better or worse than WSDL and WADL? Other \n&gt; opinion=\r\ns?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks, J=F8rn\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
