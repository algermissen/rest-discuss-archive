The first is its\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; HTTP heritage with headers, status codes, etc. (and is under-\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; appreciated or misunderstood, hence things like SOAP). The\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; second, though, is a design paradigm like OO that prescribes how\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; state and transitions are captured in representations that are\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; exchanged during the request-response pattern. Tim&#39;s &quot;aha!&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; moment was about the second.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; It&#39;s solely the second.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I have a hard time accepting this absolute statement.\n&gt;\n&gt; Er, well, sometimes it is better to have a hard time.  The former\n&gt; is web architecture and the latter is REST.\n\nThanks for settling this.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Most\n&gt;&gt; discussions on this list revolve around how to use http methods,\n&gt;&gt; status codes, and headers to map REST concepts into HTTP. While REST\n&gt;&gt; might be conceptually larger, it is bounded by its HTTP heritage.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bounded?  No way.  It isn&#39;t even 1/3rd of the style.\n\nCan you cite an example of what you mean?\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; While they aren&#39;t the same, they are Siamese twins. In other words,\n&gt;&gt; would you give a talk about REST and never mention HTTP and its\n&gt;&gt; methods, codes, and headers?\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, I have, though most of the time I give talks about the evolution\n&gt; of web architecture along with REST.\n&gt;\n&gt; That said, the purpose of this list (as Mark set it up) is to offer\n&gt; both discussion of the style and implementation advice regarding\n&gt; web architecture.  That&#39;s why there is so much discussion of HTTP.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think people do a real disservice to the reader when they start\n&gt; mixing up architecture and architectural style.  REST, as a style,\n&gt; exists independent of the Web&#39;s timeline.  HTTP, in contrast, has to\n&gt; be viewed through the limitations of particular implementations.\n&gt; REST wouldn&#39;t be a very good abstraction if its understanding\n&gt; depended on the details of today&#39;s implementations (which are far\n&gt; less limited than those of 1997, 1995, and 1993).\n&gt;\n&gt; ....Roy\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\nOk, so here is my conundrum: I was invited to give a short  \npresentation on REST following a presentation on SOAP (talk about the  \none-eyed guiding the blind! As a side point, I did refer them to you  \nfirst :) ).  Since I only have 20 minutes to convey of a few key  \npoints, I can either focus on the underlying richness of HTTP and how  \nit can be tapped by applications (I think it would be a great service  \nto web-service authors to introduce them to the magic of caching and  \nsimple redirects) or, if I stay true to the topic, talk about  \napplication architecture and distribution of state and stateless  \nprotocols.  Either topic would probably be enlightening to many, but  \nit&#39;s undeniably clear that the latter is what I need to convey to  \nstay on topic.\n\nIs there a key message you focus on as the key take away for your  \ntalks on REST?\n\n\n- Steve\n\n--------------\nSteve G.
