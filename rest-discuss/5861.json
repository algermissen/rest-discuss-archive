You can&#39;t just\n&gt;&gt; replace one with the other. It does matter to the user which one you\n&gt;&gt; give them, and what they want depends on the situation. The server\n&gt;&gt; needs to negotiate with the *user*, not the user agent, to figure out\n&gt;&gt; what representation they want in each specific situation. For non-\n&gt;&gt; commodities, I believe the best way to do that is to give them a\n&gt;&gt; different URI for each, because then the user can express his or her\n&gt;&gt; wishes with a click.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think all the issue here is mainly due to browser limitations, as  \n&gt; they\n&gt; doesn&#39;t allow the user to easily swith conneg preferences. The more I\n&gt; read discussions or I am involved in service design, the more I think\n&gt; about making a Firefox extention displaying some info about the\n&gt; available conneg on the page (Accept / Vary header ?) and providing  \n&gt; some\n&gt; menu of field to change settings for the current page only. Some\n&gt; extentions already display Header fields, but I&#39;m not aware of a\n&gt; &quot;switcher&quot; extention, except the ones allowing to fully customize\n&gt; header, which is not so user friendly.\n&gt;\nWell, we&#39;d have to do user testing with the actual implementation of  \nyour idea. But I can&#39;t imagine anything simpler for the user than  \npoint and click.\n\n&gt; An other approach to your PDF problem could be the browser set\n&gt; automaticaly the Accept header to &quot;application/postscript,\n&gt; application/pdf, text/html;q=0.8,text/*;q=0.5;*/*;q=0.1&quot; and reGET the\n&gt; page when clicking on &quot;print&quot;.\n&gt;\nWell, the trouble with this is that not every user is like me. I like  \nto print PDF and read HTML on screen, but does everyone? And I don&#39;t  \n*always* want to print PDF. Right now in my backpack I have a few  \nchapters of Roy&#39;s thesis printed out, chapters 5 and 6 I think,  \nbecause those were of greatest interest to me. At the time of  \nprinting, I didn&#39;t want to pay for paper and ink for the others, or  \ncarry around the weight and bulk. And in that situation it is  \nactually easier for me to print the two HTML documents for those two  \nchapters, and go into the PDF and figure out which from and to page I  \nwant. Having a different URI for each chapter was exactly what I  \nwanted, and exactly what I was given.\n\n&gt; For the &quot;send link&quot; and bookmark issue, you can always send a redirect\n&gt; based on conneg, if each version has is own uri.\n&gt;\nThis is true, but I think people will tend to send the URL that&#39;s in  \nthe address bar of the browser, not the one that&#39;s listed somewhere  \nas the canonical URL for the content. People will most likely link to  \none of the non-entry URLs. Hmm. I think I need some terminology. How  \nabout &quot;entry URI&quot; for the one that uses conneg to redirect to another  \n&quot;target URI&quot;. My untested belief is that people will most likely send  \nin emails the target URI they land on, and put links in their web  \npages using those target URIs. So search engines will favor the  \ntarget URIs, not the entry URI. Therefore, people will rarely go to  \nan entry URI. I don&#39;t have any plans for using entry URIs. Instead,  \nthere are just &quot;target URIs,&quot; but the target URIs will use conneg to  \ndecide whether to point to each other prominently. The one place  \nwhere I think an entry URI might work is the example that Roy gave in  \nhis earlier email on this thread, which is to the domain home itself,  \nas in:\n\nhttp://www.day.com/\n\nPeople will type that in and go there, and that URL does seem to get  \nindexed by search engines. Otherwise, I&#39;m not sure that the entry URI  \napproach is very useful. Has anyone had success with this other than  \non the domain home URL?\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nEditor-in-Chief\nArtima Developer\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n"}}
