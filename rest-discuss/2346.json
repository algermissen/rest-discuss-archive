The effect on the server of \nmultiple executions of that sequence is exactly the same as the \nexecution of just one.\n\nThe effect on the client changes from execution to execution, sure, but \nthat had better *not* make the sequence non-idempotent, otherwise,\n\n  DELETE /foo   (200 OK)\n  DELETE /foo   (404 Not Found)\n\nwould imply that DELETE is non-idempotent.\n\n&gt; Please ignore my other rants.
