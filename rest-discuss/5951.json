But I&#39;m going to be a stick in the mud, for \nthe purposes of clarifying these terms better.  I think you&#39;re still \nmaking some assumptions that I&#39;m missing.\n\nAlan Dean wrote:\n&gt; The state that a RESTful server holds, is complete and persistent - by \n&gt; it&#39;s nature, session state is only partial and is volatile. I can see \n&gt; why at first glance the &#39;diamond&#39; gets around this constraint by being \n&gt; &#39;persistent&#39;, but the problem is that it is only a semantic change.\nOK, so I&#39;m taking your definition of &quot;session state&quot; as state which is \npartial and volatile.  I&#39;m not sure what &quot;partial&quot; means.  E.g., a web \npage is only part of my site, so isn&#39;t it partial?  I can change it at \nany time, so isn&#39;t it volatile?  Yet that&#39;s supposed to be the canonical \nREST example.  Also, I think you might mean &#39;ephemeral&#39; more than \n&#39;volatile&#39; here.\n\nSo, it sounds like there&#39;s a sliding scale between &quot;session state&quot; and \n&quot;persistent state&quot; - no hard boundary.\n&gt; An example. Let&#39;s say we are building an retail website. We decide \n&gt; that we need a basket to hold selected goods before checkout.\n&gt;\n&gt; We could decide to build the basket in session state.\nBy &quot;build the basket in session state&quot;, do you mean, keep it volatile?  \nBecause your definition of &quot;session state&quot; above is that it&#39;s partial \nand volatile.  E.g., perhaps you keep it in a database table, but erase \nit after 10 minutes.\n&gt; However, the session will be torn down at some point (as it is volatile).\nWhat is the &quot;session&quot;?  Is this a code name for some kind of implementation?\n&gt; Instead of making the session persistent,\nBut you said that by it&#39;s nature, session state is volatile.  So how can \nyou make it persistent?  That would be a contradiction.\n&gt; the better approach is to define the basket itself as a resource, with \n&gt; it&#39;s own URL (say http://example.com/store/user.name/basket ) which \n&gt; can accept RESTful messages to alter the state of the resource.\nBut that URL could also be volatile, so then it would be &quot;session \nstate&quot;, and not RESTful, right?  I don&#39;t see how making something into a URL\n&gt; Does the example help?\nYes, we&#39;re getting there, but I&#39;m still confused.\n\n-- \nLyle Kopnicky\nSoftware Project Engineer\nVeicon Technology, Inc.\n\n\n"}}
