In RPC, the\nclient and server can do what they like. The REST difference is that the\nrequest can be understood by arbitrary components in the network. This\nincludes intermediataries of various types, as well as more generic\nclients like browsers that were not written for the sole purpose of\nhaving this specific conversation.\n\n&gt; if this is true, what happens if the server can&#39;t reach the declared\n&gt; state? e.g., i have a printer, which i want to put online. i can\n&gt; POST/PUT &#39;online&#39; to http://example.org/printers/pr1/status. but what\n&gt; if the actual process of making the physical printer fails? won&#39;t it\n&gt; be confusing if http://example.org/printers/pr1/status changes to\n&gt; &#39;error&#39; by the server? it means the client can&#39;t be sure that what he\n&gt; posted stays. furthermore, once you allow both the server and client\n&gt; to modify resources, there&#39;s a risk of races. (or, maybe the part of\n&gt; the server that changes the resource can be thought of as a client?)\n\nThat is a server error. 500 is a good default, though if the reason for\nthe failure is known you could be more specific. 502 Bad Gateway, and\n504 Gateway Timeout can be useful codes.\n\nBenjamin.\n\n\n"}}
