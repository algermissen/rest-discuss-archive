That&#39;s not what I am saying=\r\n. Lets take it from the beginning:\n\n1) Assume minting new media types is a =\r\nno-go. Lets encode the domain data in HTML (or HAL) - a well known media fo=\r\nrmat with built-in hypermedia controls. (You were actually the one that got=\r\n me started on this in http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/mess=\r\nage/18126 with the comment &quot;and i think someone kicks a cat, too [when a ne=\r\nw media type is created]&quot; :-)\n\n2) Now we need to embed a sales order or a c=\r\nase file or some other domain specific data in the existing media type. Unf=\r\nortunately we need to support different vocabularies: the US vocabulary, th=\r\ne European Union vocabulary (both fictive), some subset of UBL or the Good =\r\nRelations vocabulary(*) \n\n3) How does the client now inform the server of w=\r\nhich vocabulary it understands? The client can ask for text/html - but wher=\r\ne should it put the &quot;and-please-serve-it-as-good-relations&quot;-requirement?\n\nA=\r\ns always - thanks for taking the time to discuss this.\n\n/J=F8rn\n\n(*) Never =\r\nmind what exactly it is. The point is that we could have many different way=\r\ns of embedding the same data in the same media type.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
