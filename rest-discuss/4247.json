See http://www.mnot.net/tarawa for an example.\n\nI&#39;m working on something similar to tarawa using PHP.\n\n&gt; I am working on a language for describing the configuration\n&gt; of such servers;\n\nI didn&#39;t quite get what you mean by that! :-/\n \n&gt; Such a server could pre-process requests which:\n&gt; 1. have a verb of POST\n&gt; 2. have a representation mime-type of\n&gt;     application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n&gt; \n&gt; The server can check whether such a request representation\n&gt; has a &#39;method&#39; parameter, as in your example.  If it does,\n&gt; it can modify the request as follows:\n&gt; 1. put in the correct verb instead of POST, in this case\n&gt;     DELETE.\n&gt; 2. delete the method parameter.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then, it can dispatch to the correct process.\n&gt; Apache::MagicPOST on CPAN does this for mod_perl.\n&gt; http://search.cpan.org/~alger/Apache-MagicPOST-1.2/lib/Apache/ \n&gt; MagicPOST.pm\n&gt; \n&gt; So, the request sent by the client uses POST, but on the\n&gt; server, it &#39;looks&#39; like a DELETE request.  The same\n&gt; technique can be used for PUT requests, of course.\n&gt; \n&gt; Remember, this is just a workaround for broken-as-designed\n&gt; HTML forms, which subset HTTP, but are also widely\n&gt; deployed.  If you use another representation (e.g. XML)\n&gt; or client (which can support DELETE), there is no need\n&gt; for this.\n\nHey, this is a neat workaround. Thanks for the pointer.\n \n&gt; It is the lesser of two evils to bury the verb in the\n&gt; request entity body rather than in the request URI.\n\nYep! That was the idea.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"}}
