It just isn&#39;t mapped to a particular\nresource.\n\n\nI have a hard time agreeing to this statement.  Sure, if you want to get\nphilosophical about the existence of URIs, one could argue that there is an\ninfinite number of URIs in existence.  But in practice, this view just does\nnot work (at least for me).  To illustrate, think of written language.  If\nyou were to encounter the following word:\n\n        vocabulary\n\nyou would know what it meant.  You recognize this as a word.  You can map\nthe word to its meaning (the resource).  In fact, I can give you any word\nand you can come up with its meaning because they *all* have mappings to a\nmeaning.\n\nHowever, if you were to encounter:\n\n        twipperty\n\nwhat would you say it is?  It has no meaning (no mapping to a resource).  Is\nit a word?  Of course not!  Will it eventually be a word?  Maybe.  But that\ndoes not make it a word right now.\n\nIn the same way, just because you encounter something that *looks* like a\nURI does not mean it&#39;s a URI.  Does that mean that examples where we see:\n\n    http://example.com/\n\nare not URIs?  No, these *are* URIs because they are mapped to examples in\nthe message.  Sure, you cannot resolve it with HTTP, but that doesn&#39;t make\nit any less of a URI.  In fact, most of the time we encounter URIs in mail,\nnews, etc. messages, they *are* URIs because of their conceptual mappings.\n\nBut then we get to HTTP.  In HTTP, a string that looks like a URI should\nnever be considered an actual URI until it is mapped to a resource (just as\nyou would not consider &quot;twipperty&quot; a word until it was mapped to a meaning).\nHTTP follows that rule everywhere except in *one* place: PUT.  In all other\ninstances, if a given URI-like string does not map to a resource, the server\nreturns an error telling you so.  But when you use PUT, you can actually\npass a URI-like string that might be accepted and treated like a URI by the\nserver.\n\nFor instance, suppose the following sequence:\n\nGET /twipperty\nPUT /twipperty\n\nIn the above example, &quot;/twipperty&quot; is a URI-like string, not an actual URI.\nAs a result, the server returns a 404 (as expected) to the first request and\na 200 (as expected) to the second request.  But if PUT was treating\n&quot;/twipperty&quot; like an actual URI in the second request, why didn&#39;t it treat\nit like one in the first request?  Simply put, because it wasn&#39;t a URI in\nthe first request.  It looked like one, but that didn&#39;t automatically make\nit one.\n\n\nNow, I am not trying to argue here that PUT is bad.  In light of other\nconversations, I am still debating the value of PUT, though I do see what\nPaul Prescod, et al. are saying about it.  All I am saying here is that I\nthink it a bad idea to act as if anything that looks like a URI actually\n*is* a URI (as is evident from the ever ongoing debates over the XML\nNamespace rec). Using PUT to make a non-URI into a URI by treating it as if\nit were a URI already just causes confusion.\n\nI much more like the idea of using POST to request that a URI-like string be\nmade into an actual URI and associated to a resource.  PUT can still be used\nto update the resource through the URI, but only once the mapping exists\n(and therefore the URI exists as well).  Actually, as Paul points out, POST\nis a bit overloaded here.  I wouldn&#39;t mind instead a CREATE verb or\nsomething like it that would do what I suggest with the POST.  For instance:\n\n\n--&gt;\nCREATE /existingpath\nLocation: /existingpath/twipperty\n\n&lt;--\n201 Created\nLocation: /existingpath/twipperty\n\n\nThis way, URIs do not exist until they have a mapping.  Period.\n\n\n\nYou can have strings that look like URIs that aren&#39;t, but you can also have\nstrings that look like words that aren&#39;t as well.  My four year old daughter\nhas no problem with understanding when something isn&#39;t a word.  Why should\nURIs be any different?\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
