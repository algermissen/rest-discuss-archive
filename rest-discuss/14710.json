(this is what I think makes up a service type for discovery and &#39;governance&#39; purposes)\n&gt;   \n\nI would choose to say &#39;set of representations&#39; over &#39;set of media \ntypes&#39;. Those representations will define types of link relations, which \nin turn define the application flow(s). Over time - other links/flows \ncan be added, resources moved, media-types added etc. This is what I \nhave understood as evolveability aspect of REST wrt the hypertext \nconstraint.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The funny thing for me was that, once actively accepting these consequences, it turns out there is really not so much that can change about a server given the above obligations. \n\nOk - are you saying this is a Good Thing?\n\n- Mike\n\n"}}
