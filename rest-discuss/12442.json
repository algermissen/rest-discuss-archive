From my p=\r\nerspective, a good RESTful client should be able to survive with just (1) t=\r\nhe root URL of the service through which it can follow the hypermedia and (=\r\n2) basic knowledge on the format of the representations of the resources ar=\r\ne to be interpreted.\n\nMy concerns are:\n1 - Let as assume another server app=\r\n consuming a RESTful service. At start-up, it gets the links useful from th=\r\ne root URL then traverses them as necessary. Assuming there are elements, s=\r\nuch as forms, these are probably stored as well. However, when the RESTful =\r\nservice evolves, say, changes the URIs, etc, the consumer&#39;s data would be o=\r\nutdated. How is this best handled?\n\nI could opt to always start each reques=\r\nt with the root URL all the time, then follow the necessary links all the t=\r\nime. Of course, it&#39;ll be best to take advantage of caching and/or condition=\r\nal GETs here. (Alternatively, I can just have a document that contains all =\r\nthe possible operations in one document - say WADL instead of traversing se=\r\nveral links.)\n\n2 - What&#39;s a good guideline on what stuff to watch out in th=\r\ne representations? I wouldn&#39;t want my representations to always adhere to a=\r\n specific schema so as not to hinder its evolution. But some things have to=\r\n be kept constant for older REST clients on the same service working right?=\r\n What&#39;s a good guideline for those? (i.e. a specific XPath will always poin=\r\nt to a specific information regardless of whatever revisions the service go=\r\nes through.)\n\nLastly, I was wondering why there aren&#39;t that many good artic=\r\nles on how to create a good RESTful client for a specific service. There ar=\r\ne tons for building services, but not so much on building good clients.\n\n\n"}}
