I codeveloped a non-trivial RESTful web\n&gt; service and saw first-hand the advantages of REST.   My job includes\n&gt; &quot;selling&quot; technology to other developers.  Most developers  I encounter\n&gt; immediately grok the tactical advantages of REST (caching, scalability,\n&gt; stateless messages, firewall-friendly, ...),  but seem to zone-out over the\n&gt; strategic advantages of Resource-Oriented design over Objected-Oriented\n&gt; design.  To be honest, although I believe it,  I am weak in defending this\n&gt; assertion.  I don&#39;t have a firm enough grasp on the academics of the\n&gt; subject.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyone have some pearls of wisdom?
