[..]\n&gt;\n&gt; It certainly is not a deliberate debating tactic, it is me trying to make\n&gt; sense of things and to also figure out why the state of REST has been\n&gt; bugging me so much. But I&#39;ve been doing a lot of reading and work offline\n&gt; and I think I&#39;m getting a handle on what&#39;s been bugging me and how to\n&gt; resolve it.\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.mikeschinkel.com/blog/WhatIsARESTafarian.aspx \n&gt;&gt;&gt; from where I&#39;m standing people are doing their level best here \n&gt;&gt;&gt; to answer your questions. That doesn&#39;t help, at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not sure where you are going with this. I do appreciate all the help,\n&gt; and I am here with the best of intentions, I can assure you of that.\n\nWhen I read that blog post about RESTafarians, and when you start this \nresponse with &quot;now Bill, no need to get defensive&quot;, I&#39;m not sure what to \nthink about your assurances.\n\nConfusing HTTP and REST results technical gibberish, it&#39;s not something \nto encourage or equivocate about. If you were on comp.lang.object and \nmixed up a JVM  implementation detail and object oriention, or confusing \nXerces bug with XML on xml-dev, it would hardly be reasonable to \ndescribe a clarification as &quot;defensive&quot;.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
