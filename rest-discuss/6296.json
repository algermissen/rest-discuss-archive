You write &quot;The HTTP spec doesn&#39;t say we&#39;re allowed to \n&gt; have URLs with usernames and passwords in them so we can&#39;t guarentee \n&gt; that they work anywhere else either.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s not really the HTTP spec that&#39;s relevant. It&#39;s the URI spec, RFC \n&gt; 3986. What that says is:\n&gt; \n&gt;     The userinfo subcomponent may consist of a user name and, optionally,\n&gt;     scheme-specific information about how to gain authorization to access\n&gt;     the resource.  The user information, if present, is followed by a\n&gt;     commercial at-sign (&quot;@&quot;) that delimits it from the host.\n&gt; \n&gt;        userinfo    = *( unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims / &quot;:&quot; )\n&gt; \n&gt;     Use of the format &quot;user:password&quot; in the userinfo field is\n&gt;     deprecated.\n\nActually it *is* the HTTP spec that is important here - in how it uses \nthe URI spec in defining HTTP URIs (not all items that can be parts of a \nvalid URI can be used with all URI schemes).\n\nThe HTTP URI scheme is defined by RFC2616 as:\n\n&quot;http:&quot; &quot;//&quot; host [ &quot;:&quot; port ] [ abs_path [ &quot;?&quot; query ]]\n\nSo not only does the HTTP spec not say you allowed to have usernames and \npasswords in URIs, but actively prohibits it - such URIs do not match \nthe sheme-specific syntax.\n\nSupporting such URIs as an extension has become less popular since they \nwere used in many spoofing attacks (IE stopping it entirely, Firefox \nallowing it, but prompting you first).\n\n"}}
