The performance of a larger set of the underlying component\ntopology could be measured at the user agent, from the intiation of the\nPOST request until the next steady-state is achieved, i.e. whatever the\nuser agent does with the 201 response, like proceed to reload and render\nthe comment thread.\n\nThat way, the &quot;in-circuit&quot; component topology would include everything\nthat affects the user-perceived performance of a REST application being\nexecuted within, say, a Web browser.  The goal of the underlying system\nin this case, would be &quot;post a comment and proceed to the next steady-\nstate&quot;, every time it executes the &quot;post a comment&quot; application (still\nassuming the 201 case).\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
