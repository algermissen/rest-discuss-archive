Yes if you=\r\n define RESTFulness as a badge that certifies you follow the\n&gt;&gt; rules. Yes,=\r\n you can earn that badge only in your server and forget about\n&gt;&gt; the client=\r\n.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; b. NO, if you define RESTFulness as the achievement of the expected=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; quality properties you seek for when using REST. And that NO is because=\r\n the\n&gt;&gt; rules are made to achieve a way of interaction between the componen=\r\nts, and\n&gt;&gt; one of those components is the client.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In other words, cli=\r\nent matters.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As I had been posting here, one component may not behave=\r\n by the rules,\n&gt;&gt; but if that is free license the architect is aware of and=\r\n it is reasonable\n&gt;&gt; so that the impact will not break the business goals, =\r\nthat is fine. But if\n&gt;&gt; you need a system where clients behave correctly, a=\r\nnd you don&#39;t control the\n&gt;&gt; clients, then your architecture must have contr=\r\nols and policy enforcement\n&gt;&gt; to avoid those spoiled clients from ruining y=\r\nou day. If not, your system\n&gt;&gt; will not get to its goal and it will be a fa=\r\nilure, even if your server is\n&gt;&gt; made by the REST book.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; REST stops wh=\r\nen it defines the constrains and promises quality\n&gt;&gt; properties, but life g=\r\noes on, and the rest of the system is still to be\n&gt;&gt; constructed. Having ju=\r\nst one server following REST rules is just one step.\n&gt;&gt; And let me clarify =\r\nthis: It should not be part of the server&#39;s job to\n&gt;&gt; assure the client is =\r\nworking as it should. It may help, but we can have\n&gt;&gt; several layers that c=\r\nan add controls and enforce policies. There is far\n&gt;&gt; more in an system tha=\r\nn just one server and one client.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Finally: I feel the discussion conf=\r\nuses an App, with a Server, with a\n&gt;&gt; System, with a API. When we talk abou=\r\nt a server doing its part, sounds like\n&gt;&gt; we are talking about an API. Is i=\r\nt that? Yes, we can expose a REST like\n&gt;&gt; API, but then we need a client to=\r\n consume it. A system is something far\n&gt;&gt; more complex, where all component=\r\ns, including clients, may affect other\n&gt;&gt; components.
