Mostly\nbusiness logic is concerned with getting things done.\n\nThe database is there to act as backup and swap space.  Backup so you\ndon&#39;t lose data stored in volatile memory, and swap space to handle\ndata too large to fit in volatile memory.  Most of what you&#39;re\ndescribing is grunt work that the business logic has to put up with,\nso it can benefit from using a database.\n\nThe question is, what are your resources exposing?  Raw data storage,\nin which case there are different ways for enforcing consistency and\nconstraints, not all of which require writing code -- or resources\nthat handle the workload, making sure an order gets shipped and\ncustomers gets billed, in which case they require a lot of business\nlogic.\n\nAssaf\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Again, I&#39;m sorry if this is a stupid question with an obvious answer,\n&gt; but I picture this as a huge system whos state is directly malluable\n&gt; due to the constraints in place at the edges of the system, ensuring\n&gt; the integrity of the actions performed on the state of said system.\n&gt;\n&gt; Am I way off base here? Am I in arm-wavy territory here?\n&gt;\n&gt; (Also, sorry if this is isnt 100% ReST based, but I feel this is a\n&gt; ReSTy question due to the fact that the manipulations of the state\n&gt; system are driven by ReST)\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers!\n&gt;\n&gt; Ben\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
