They are willing to implement systems suggested by the proposal and pay for their development of the entire system. I&#39;d hoping someone will sketch a proposal based on a RESTful solution. The airport will offer some kiosks passengers can use, and taxis also have a client computer. \n\nWe also have word that a rival contractor, Fuddy Duddy Enterprise Solutions has bid on the contract.\n\nThe Fuddy proposal uses an message broke at the airport and to create a queue in it where messages represent passenger taxi requests. These messages are enqueued when passengers request a taxi in step 2. They plan to create a standalone fat client application for taxis. In step 3 taxis make a connection to the airport system, and make a blocking dequeue request, which is answered in step 4 and the taxi is told how to meet up with the passenger. The taxi app then presents the driver with a screen where they enter Y/N on whether the agreement was reached per steps 8 or 12. The customer can also tell the airport this per step 12, using the same kiosk they used to request the taxi service. Furthermore, the taxi app enforces the timeout per step 8. The customers message will be acknowledged and removed from the queue by the taxi app&#39;s &quot;Y&quot; response. If either party backs out or the time expires, the airport passenger&#39;s request will be dispatched again to a new\n cab, and the original cab will also get the next available passenger. The taxi client will automatically throw an error back if an already rejected passenger is redispatched to it, but it will reissue another dequeue request first, so that it get a new passenger assignment if one is to be had. If not, and there is no other cab to take the passenger, then the cab will repeat repeat this pattern every few seconds. The same client app can be used to query the queue size, per step 12.\n\n\n\n----- Original Message ----\nFrom: Jan Algermissen &lt;algermissen1971@...&gt;\n\nOn Jul 3, 2010, at 12:45 PM, bryan_w_taylor wrote:\n\nI am not sure what you are up to with this.

What are those use cases and where is the software system that is to realize them?\n\nI guess what makes most sense is that the airport is the system, but then you mentioned it as an actor, too.\n\nCan you clarify?\n\nJan\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
