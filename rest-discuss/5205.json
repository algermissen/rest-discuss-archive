My CGI program is named guestbook\nand my domain name is metaperl.org\n\nGET /guestbook\n  returns the first 10 entries of the guestbook with links to page\n  forward to 11-20. REST supposedly works without cookies, so if a\n  user had a preference for entry listings per page, what to do?\nGET /guestbook?o=xml\n  returns the entire guestbook in XML format\nPOST /guestbook\n  adds an entry to the guestbook. But here is my problem, I need a URL\n  which returns a page that the user can fill in and hit submit. What\n  would such a URL look like?\nGET /guestbook/stats\n  returns a page showing the stats on the guestbook.\n\n\n\n-- \n\tCarter&#39;s Compass: I know I&#39;m on the right track when,\n\t   by deleting something, I&#39;m adding functionality.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
