Bowman:\n&gt; &quot;The trade-off, though, is that a uniform interface degrades\n&gt; efficiency, since information is transferred in a standardized form\n&gt; rather than one which is specific to an application&#39;s needs. The REST\n&gt; interface is designed to be efficient for large-grain hypermedia data\n&gt; transfer, optimizing for the common case of the Web, but resulting in\n&gt; an interface that is not optimal for other forms of architectural\n&gt; interaction.&quot;\n\nWell, off-heart I guess we&#39;re not &quot;traditional&quot; hypermedia, we couldn&#39;t \nbe less than that. We live off providing hosted, managed document \nmanagement services for construction sites. However, I found that in \nmany respects hypermedia concepts apply to the way we keep track of our \ndocument structures, as well. There are different customer projects. \nWorkspaces. There are different groups of documents (drawings, photo \ndocumentation, lists, ...) inside each project (feeds), each of them \nallow for read/write access, though the latter usually limited to \ncertain media types (PDF/HPGL/DWF for drawing layouts, JPG for images, \nPDF for virtually everything else). We have to keep track of what we see \nthe &quot;content&quot; of a document (structured key/value metadata) and 1..n \nalternate representations (like a drawing which we have to keep three \nequivalent files of - HPGL, PDF, DWF). We have human-readable summaries \n(usually used by humans in order to tell what kind of document it is), \ncreation / change dates, we have authors and different versions and the \nwhole load. We have documents mainly sorted by key/value attributes, \nvalues being based upon predefined catalogs. Atom categories. That&#39;s \nwhat we eventually got. We need, in most cases, data exchange with \nsystems which are &quot;external&quot; from our point of view. Document management \ninstallations at our customers sites. Competing application service \nproviders. In all cases, it eventually boils down to transfering \ndocument content (metadata + files) periodically, polling and fetching \nwhat is new.\n\nI spent less than a few hours late one evening diving through some \narticles on Atom and repeatedly saw our use cases covered rather well by \nwhat Atom and APP provides. No, we&#39;re not a weblog provider or a news \naggregator, but in some ways Atom and APP seems to make sense \ntechnically. Sure, it partially _is_ mapping our stuff to Atom/APP, but \nin the end we, well, end up with an external interface relying upon \nwell-known technologies adhering to well-known semantics rather than \nre-inventing the same wheel in a slightly different way in SOAP like so \nmany does. I then and now enjoy using SOAP, same as I did using CORBA \nbefore, but for this kind of purpose (exchanging information between \ndifferent sites where anything else than the systems being loosely \ncoupled is totally illusionary), things just get overly painful while \nmanually crafting a custom media type. Did this using JSON in an early \nprototype, and learnt enough off this to want it really done with \nstandards used more widespread when going productive. So far, it seems \nAtom/APP as primary media type, backed by HAL+JSON or the like as an \nalternative, seems a sane way here.\n\n\n&gt; Maybe I&#39;m just grumpy because yet another website I frequent now\n&gt; features a broken back button, paging back through script after script\n&gt; until finally, on the 4th or 5th click, user intent is finally\n&gt; respected.\n\nKnow what you mean. Then and now was hoping this behaviour would \neventually be gone one day, but it seems it&#39;s still here to stay. :/\n\nCheers,\nKristian\n\n"}}
