See=\r\n for instance http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/rfc5023.html#collection_r=\r\nesource where POST/PUT/DELETE is defined for AtomPub\n&gt; \n\nYes, correct. Or m=\r\nore exactly: HTTP methods mean the same thing regardless of context (unifor=\r\nm interface). Resource semantics (the stuff you learn about resources from =\r\nhypermedia references) is what is defined in media types (or link relation =\r\nspecs).\n\nMedia types ideally do not specify what methods to use for resourc=\r\nes with certain semantics. That would be an over-specification because it i=\r\ns up to the server to make these decisions (and change them anytime).\n\nMedi=\r\na type specs however can fruitfully provide hints to the canonical/intended=\r\n use cases that informed the design of the media type in the first place. S=\r\nHOULD requirements often reflect that and inform server developers about th=\r\ne most sensible implementation choices.\n\nWhat you can specifiy in media typ=\r\nes is which method a user agent developer should use for the implementation=\r\n of a control (e.g. GET on HTML &lt;a&gt; links or &lt;img&gt;es, POST/GET for &lt;form&gt;s,=\r\n depending on action parameter, etc. But there is no guarantee (aka couplin=\r\ng) that the server will actually support that message. (It should of course=\r\n, because it sent the previous hypermedia in the first place :-)\n\nIf a requ=\r\nest fails, HTTP provides error codes to hint the client how to fix its own =\r\nconfiguration to match a particular service&#39;s implementation. This is an as=\r\npect that is unlikely to change and likely needs only be adjusted once per =\r\nlive time of the service.\n(BTW, this IMHO indicates a conceptual third &#39;xxx=\r\n-time&#39; between design-time and run-time. You might think of it as &#39;introspe=\r\nction time&#39; or &#39;configuration time&#39;. OPTIONS requests relate to this. Nice =\r\narea for research, IMO).\n\n&gt; This seems more and more like re-inventing the =\r\nexact reason for having media types - but hiding/tunneling it inside some g=\r\neneric format like application/xml.\n&gt; \n\nYes, exactly.\n\n&gt; You are right in t=\r\nhe way that, yes, it can be done. But there should be no need for it when t=\r\nhe same thing can be done with a properly defined media type.\n\nActually, st=\r\nrictly speaking there is no need for this in the media type either.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\nf you build your application on top of HTTP, using it only for transport of=\r\n data and using only predefined domain-agnostic formats like application/xm=\r\nl, then, yes, you would have to put the domain specific semantics &quot;somewher=\r\ne else&quot;.\n\nYes, exactly.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; If, on the other hand, you accept HTTP as an =\r\napplication protocol, then you can use the media type for defining your sem=\r\nantics.\n\nYes.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; But, apparently there are different views of HTTP as an=\r\n application protocol or a simple data transfer layer?\n\nIn my experience, i=\r\nt is still very common that people try to bend REST in order to match their=\r\n view of a problem - instead of bending their view of the problem to make s=\r\nense from a REST POV. Such bent-versions (&#39;views&#39; in your sentence) of REST=\r\n are not necessarily bad, but they are not REST as it has been defined[1]. =\r\nThis can sometimes make approaching REST more confusing as it already usual=\r\nly is.\n\nJan\n\n\n[1] And they consequently do not guarantee that you end up wi=\r\nth a system that has the properties REST guarantees.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; /J=F8rn\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
