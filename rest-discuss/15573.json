That makes the argument that RPC over HTTP is absolutely bad. Even though I can see the value that a RESTful style provides, I don&#39;t see why a person building an AJAX style application who uses RPC over HTTP as a means to improve responsiveness is in itself a bad thing.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I personally worked on quite a few RPC over HTTP style AJAX apps where the goal was improving responsiveness in the application and to offer a rich client type experience in a brower. Yes it dishonors hypermedia constraints (we didn&#39;t even know what those were), but it worked and made paying customers pretty happy that they had a more interactive / responsive UI. That was the primary goal and the benefit. I don&#39;t think we were deluded into any other benefits.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Do you see that as &quot;wrong&quot;?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Personally I feel like calling that REST is wrong, in the way calling some that is not an implementation of MVC, MVC.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Glenn\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; On Sun, Jun 6, 2010 at 9:04 PM, Jan Algermissen &lt;algermissen1971@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Glenn,\n&gt; \n&gt; On Jun 7, 2010, at 12:10 AM, Glenn Block wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Darrel and I were chatting and we started to discuss the problem of using &quot;RPC over HTTP&#39; to mean &quot;REST&quot;. The result of that conversation seemed to be that the problem is the usage of the term &#39;REST&#39; in that nothing about RPC over HTTP is RESTful in nature.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think one of the big problems in this area is the lack of proper names for all the various abuses of REST. Having names helps to differentiate. I created a classification of mis-uses a while back: http://nordsc.com/ext/classification_of_http_based_apis.html\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; My argument, the fact that folks want to use HTTP as a pure transport for loose XML/JSON in itself is not a problem asd long as one has proper expectations about the pros/cons.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, but the problem being the end of the sentence: &quot;as long as one has proper expectations&quot;. I seriously doubt that a significant number of people understand the trade offs (if they did, they would just do true REST because the gains outweigh (IMHO small) the additional effort).\n&gt; \n&gt; While there might not be a problem if you understand what you are doing, it also makes no real sense to do it (it is not really justifiable).\n&gt; \n&gt; Jan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That led me to think of a new term to represent the &quot;RPC over HTTP&quot; movement and which is along the spirit of the whole &quot;No SQL&quot; mantra.  &quot;No SOAP&quot; - the meaning of which is &quot;Not Only SOAP&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; LIke it or hate it?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards\n&gt; &gt; Glenn\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -----------------------------------\n&gt;  Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n&gt;  NORD Software Consulting\n&gt; \n&gt;  Mail: algermissen@...\n&gt;  Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n&gt;  Work: http://www.nordsc.com/\n&gt; -----------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n-----------------------------------\n Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n NORD Software Consulting\n\n Mail: algermissen@...\n Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n Work: http://www.nordsc.com/\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
