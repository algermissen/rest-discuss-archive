Any\n&gt;&gt;&gt;*thing*,  period, can have an identifier\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;This is a meaningless statement. As soon as you&#39;ve stated **that\n&gt;&gt;thing** you&#39;ve identified it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;You&#39;re confusing identity with identification. Someone will be the first \n&gt;person to call me on the phone tomorrow, I&#39;ve no idea who (ie. I \n&gt;couldn&#39;t identify them), but whoever it will be is (and always was and \n&gt;will be) a satisifer of x = x. That&#39;s all identity is, nothing more, \n&gt;nothing less.\n&gt;\nHmm. Seems like different people are operating with different (pefrectly \nvalid) definitions for the word identity:\n\n   1. The collective aspect of the set of characteristics by which a\n      thing is definitively recognizable or known: ?If the broadcast\n      group is the financial guts of the company, the news division is\n      its public identity? (Bill Powell).\n   2. The set of behavioral or personal characteristics by which an\n      individual is recognizable as a member of a group.\n   3. The quality or condition of being the same as something else.\n   4. _/Mathematics./_\n         1. An equation that is satisfied by any number that replaces\n            the letter for which the equation is defined.\n         2. Identity element.\n\n\nPersonally, I think of 1. when seeing the word. It would appear that \nothers may be thinking more in terms of 4.\n\nI&#39;ll not argue which should be used.\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
