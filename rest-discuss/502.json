I concur with Alex about notification messages identifying the\ntype of\n&gt; &gt; change made - but I would like all six noted here.\n&gt; &gt; Paul wants only &#39;changed&#39;, but I see little extra cost to identifying\nthe\n&gt; &gt; type of change and I do see cost using further messages to identify the\ntype\n&gt; &gt; of change. I&#39;m thinking of pub/sub with many many listeners - you&#39;d get\nan\n&gt; &gt; &#39;implosion&#39; of &#39;was that change a delete or not?&#39;\n&gt;\n&gt; Fine. So you admit that it is an optimization. All I want to do is leave\n&gt; the precise details of the optimization to the application. If it wants\n&gt; to send Unix-format diffs, then it can. If it wants to have six event\n&gt; types, then it can. If it wants twenty event types, then it can. All I\n&gt; ask is that the information about what happened also exist in some form\n&gt; on the web server so that people who miss a message can get caught up.\n&gt;\nI don&#39;t mean the details in the body, I mean (from Alex&#39;s example) the\nmethod used for the notification.\nEven with no details about the current or changed values of the the\nresource, I would like to know what type of operation occurred.\n\n&quot;Having information about what happened on the web server&quot; - the web server\nwould have the results of applying what happned, but it wouldn&#39;t have a\nrecord of what happened. It wouldn&#39;t (in general) have an audit trail - like\n&#39;paul edited this file at 12:00am with vi&#39;. It would have &#39;the file says\n&quot;hello world&quot;&#39;.\n\nAlso, I don&#39;t want &#39;twenty event types&#39;, I only want HTTP referenceable\n&#39;event types&#39; - a mapping of what occurred into http state transition\noperations. Having &#39;twenty event types&#39; is analagous to having twenty http\nmethods. Yes, I know the resource could have been changed through some other\nmeans than http - but the subscription and notifications are expressed in\nterms of http, so the notification should be /fully/ expresed in terms of\nhttp.\n\n\n&gt; &gt; ... If listeners almost never\n&gt; &gt; care or try to find out, then it&#39;s not as big a deal.\n&gt; &gt; Another thing, while I&#39;m up here in the ivory tower, since I would like\na\n&gt; &gt; notification for &#39;read&#39;, that wouldn&#39;t make sense via a &#39;change&#39;\n&gt; &gt; notification. (The reason I want a &#39;read&#39; is that when coupled with a\n&gt; &gt; response status of &#39;security error&#39; you can detect security issues and\n&gt; &gt; stuff. And I know that non-http based modifications don&#39;t have these\n&gt; &gt; concepts, but they can be mapped.)\n&gt;\n&gt; You could do a regular CHANGE watch on the file that logs READs. Then if\n&gt; you miss a notification you can always get caught up by reading the\n&gt; READ-logfile. If the only place that information is stored is in the\n&gt; notification then one lost notification and you won&#39;t know that some\n&gt; hacker broke into your system.\nIf you don&#39;t have &#39;reliable&#39; delivery.\nWatching a file that contains READ occurrances is fine - but I would like to\ndeclare that in the subscription in a standardized way (WATCH /foo/logins\nmethod=READ) rather than a URI up to application definition (WATCH\n/foo/logins/all_reads).\n\n\n\n"}}
