My impression is that  \n&gt; HTTP DELETE (at least in a REST world) should only operate on a  \n&gt; single resource.   Is that an accurate interpretation?\n\nThe method is applied to whatever the URI identifies.  As Mike says, an\nURI with a query-component is as much of an URI as one without;\n`DELETE /foo?count=6` or `DELETE /foo/half-dozen` ;)\n\nIf that URI identifies a resource which is a &quot;subcollection&quot; of\nresources, then perhaps the DELETE applies to them all ... or perhaps it\nfails.  To Jan&#39;s point, I guess both what is selected and what the\nultimate effects are depend on what the semantic of the query portion\nactually is, and what the server wants to support ... on my\nbizarro-world server, perhaps `DELETE /parts?part-id=00345` actually\nmeans delete all the parts *except* for the one identified by part-id\n00345. :)  Hopefully the shared-semantics of the media types and the\ninteractions leading up to the DELETE request being made allow the\nclient to generate the appropriately-&quot;desired&quot; thing.\n\nIn any case, I don&#39;t see any reason why the DELETE method can not apply\nto a (set of) resource(s) identified by a URI with a query component.  \n\n...jsled\n-- \nhttp://asynchronous.org/ - `a=jsled; b=asynchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b}`\n\n"}}
