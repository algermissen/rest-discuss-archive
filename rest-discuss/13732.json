The dataset resources can be\n&gt; on a totally different servers / domains than the processing ones, for\n&gt; various reasons. Several open questions arise, like where the URI,\n&gt; resulting from the processing service should point, if the processing\n&gt; service itself doesn&#39;t want to implement any of the data storage/access\n&gt; capabilities itself?\n\nWhat&#39;s the issue.\n\nServer 1 receives a request to &lt;http://server1/someResource&gt; does \nsomething that affects &lt;http://server2/someResource&gt; and makes use of \nthat URI in its response.\n\nWhat&#39;s the difficulty?\n\n &gt; What about authentication and authorization within\n &gt; such a system (centralized, federated )?\n\nYeah, one of those. REST gives you a means to transfer representations, \nwhich gives you can use to transfer a representation of authentication \ntokens between clients and servers. The details of what happens away \nfrom the REST interface aren&#39;t a matter of REST, but REST allows for the \nvarious &quot;I am me&quot; or &quot;I know that secret thing&quot; statements involved.\n\n&gt; While this is a typical scenario for SOAP web services, it seems we are\n&gt; hitting the limits of REST architecture here - having multiple\n&gt; independent services, that we would like to access in an uniform way\n&gt; from a client.\n\nYou&#39;ve just described the world-wide-web. As much as SOAP people seem to \nkeep insisting otherwise, the www is real and it works.\n\n\n"}}
