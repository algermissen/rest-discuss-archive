This is usually how we handling this\n&gt; i=\r\nn HTML. Why would the same approach not work with an RDF-ish media\n&gt; type?\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Here are some examples:\n&gt; &gt; HTML.IMG\n&gt; &gt; means &quot;retrieve the resource=\r\n and embed it in the page (don&#39;t navigate to\n&gt; it)&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; X.INCLUDE\n&gt; &gt; m=\r\neans &quot;retrieve the resource and embed it in the page (don&#39;t navigate to\n&gt; i=\r\nt)&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; If the embedded image feature of HTML had been implemented as `&lt;lin=\r\nk\n&gt; rel=3D&quot;embedded-image&quot; href=3D&quot;...&quot;/&gt;` would we be worse off (from a RE=\r\nST\n&gt; perspective)? If a `link` with a specific rel is pretty much the same\n=\r\n&gt; as the `img` tag then it seems that we could achieve that result with\n&gt; R=\r\nDF-ish formats. If you think there is a material difference, please\n&gt; examp=\r\nle that in more details\n&gt;\n&gt; My gut feeling is that retrieve vs navigate is =\r\na distinction without\n&gt; much of a difference in the context of automated us=\r\ner agents. The\n&gt; distinction is obviously important for certain clients (ie=\r\n, browsers)\n&gt; but not for others (ie, proxies, screen readers, etc).\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nHTML.A\n&gt; &gt; means &quot;navigate to the resource (don&#39;t embed it)&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ATOM.L=\r\nINK@rel=3D&quot;alternate&quot;\n&gt; &gt; means &quot;navigate to the resource (don&#39;t embed it)&quot;=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Seems like most links are either the &quot;navigate&quot; flavor or have some\n&gt; =\r\nspecific semantics to the user agent that could be specified with an\n&gt; `@re=\r\nl`. Given the markup nature of HTML it probably needs a special\n&gt; form of l=\r\nink to &quot;linkify some text&quot;. I don&#39;t see the need for more\n&gt; than two kinds =\r\nof links in HTML, and in more automata oriented formats\n&gt; it seems that one=\r\n flavor of link should be sufficient.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; HTML.FORM@method=3D&quot;:get&quot;\n&gt; &gt; m=\r\neans &quot;collect the arguments, construct a URI and navigate to that\n&gt; &gt; resou=\r\nrce using the HTTP method &quot;get&quot; (don&#39;t make a body w/ the args)&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; HT=\r\nML.FORM@method=3D&quot;post&quot;\n&gt; &gt; means &quot;collect the arguments, construct a body =\r\nand navigate to that\n&gt; &gt; resource using the HTTP method &quot;post&quot; (don&#39;t const=\r\nruct a URI w/ the\n&gt; &gt; args)&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yeah, uri template support and a form voca=\r\nbulary would be useful.\n&gt; However, may systems do not require that set of c=\r\napabilities. I don&#39;t\n&gt; see the method paramater as all that important.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nA get form is really just a specification for how to render a UI for a\n&gt; UR=\r\nI template. For an automated user agent such a specification is\n&gt; superflou=\r\ns, the same thing can be accomplished with just a link whose\n&gt; target is a =\r\nURI template. (Possibly with a couple of extra resources\n&gt; representing the=\r\n set of valid values for the various options.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Similarly, in the contex=\r\nt of automated user agents, anything you can\n&gt; do with a form, you can do w=\r\nithout form by sufficiently specifying the\n&gt; media type and/or relationship=\r\ns.\n&gt;\n&gt; (Though in some situations a form might better than either of the\n&gt; =\r\nabove choices.)\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ATOM:LINK@rel=3D&quot;edit&quot;\n&gt; &gt; means &quot;use this link to PU=\r\nT or DELETE the indicated resource using\n&gt; &gt; guidlines set out in AtomPub\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; none of the RDF media types i have encountered have these affordance=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; built in; there is no universal way for servers to inform clients of\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; the valid/appropriate possibilities at any point in time. Clients must\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; have this information hard-coded instead.\n&gt;\n&gt; So is your point that no =\r\none has bothered to put together a decent RDF\n&gt; based media type? Or that i=\r\nt would be very difficult/impossible to do\n&gt; so?\n&gt;\n&gt; These affordances you&#39;=\r\nve mentioned are either built on link+@rel which\n&gt; is, at least to me, sema=\r\nntically indistinguishable from an RDF triple,\n&gt; or they are media type spe=\r\ncific, and therefore not &quot;universal&quot;. Even\n&gt; the ones that seem particularl=\r\ny distinctive don&#39;t always mean what\n&gt; they are specified to mean.\n&gt;\n&gt; For =\r\nexample, if my automated user agent reads in an HTML page it does\n&gt; *not* r=\r\netrieve and embed image resources linked to by that page.\n&gt; Neither do the =\r\naccelerating proxies though which it passes, they just\n&gt; retrieve and cache=\r\n. Interestingly they do exactly the same thing with\n&gt; the `a` tags in the H=\r\nTML. For the proxies there is no distinction\n&gt; between `img` and `a` tags e=\r\nxcept perhaps in prioritization.\n&gt;\n&gt; Peter\n&gt;  &lt;http://barelyenough.org&gt;bare=\r\nlyenough.org\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;\n\r\n--e89a8fb208982ca41d04b622c378\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nMike:&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Check my understanding of the HAL design:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;HAL offers just one hypermedia affordance: link navigation=\r\n (or LO in the H-Factor[1] list) with a @rel decorator(or CL in the H-facto=\r\nr list).

Why would the same approach not =\r\nwork with an RDF-ish media&lt;br&gt;\ntype?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Here are some examples:&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; HTML.IMG&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; means &quot;retrieve the resource and embed it i=\r\nn the page (don&#39;t navigate to it)&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; X.INCLUDE&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; means &quot;retrieve the resource and embed it in the page (don&#39;t=\r\n navigate to it)&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIf the embedded image feature of HTML had b=\r\neen implemented as `&lt;link&lt;br&gt;\nrel=3D&quot;embedded-image&quot; href=3D&q=\r\nuot;...&quot;/&gt;` would we be worse off (from a REST&lt;br&gt;\nperspective)?  I=\r\nf a `link` with a specific rel is pretty much the same&lt;br&gt;\nas the `img` tag=\r\n then it seems that we could achieve that result with&lt;br&gt;\nRDF-ish formats. =\r\nIf you think there is a material difference, please&lt;br&gt;\nexample that in mor=\r\ne details&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nMy gut feeling is that retrieve vs navigate is a distinc=\r\ntion without&lt;br&gt;\nmuch of a difference in the context of automated user agen=\r\nts. The&lt;br&gt;\ndistinction is obviously important for certain clients (ie, bro=\r\nwsers)&lt;br&gt;\nbut not for others (ie, proxies, screen readers, etc).&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; HTML.A&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; means &quot;navigate to the resource (don&#39;t embed =\r\nit)&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ATOM.LINK@rel=3D&quot;alternate&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nmeans &quot;navigate to the resource (don&#39;t embed it)&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSe=\r\nems like most links are either the &quot;navigate&quot; flavor or have some=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nspecific semantics to the user agent that could be specified with an&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n`@rel`. Given the markup nature of HTML it probably needs a special&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nform of link to &quot;linkify some text&quot;. I don&#39;t see the need for=\r\n more&lt;br&gt;\nthan two kinds of links in HTML, and in more automata oriented fo=\r\nrmats&lt;br&gt;\nit seems that one flavor of link should be sufficient.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; HTML.FORM@method=3D&quot;:get&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; means &quot;collect the ar=\r\nguments, construct a URI and navigate to that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; resource using the H=\r\nTTP method &quot;get&quot; (don&#39;t make a body w/ the args)&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; HTML.FORM@method=3D&quot;post&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; means &quot;collec=\r\nt the arguments, construct a body and navigate to that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; resource us=\r\ning the HTTP method &quot;post&quot; (don&#39;t construct a URI w/ the&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; args)&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nYeah, uri template support and a form vocabulary =\r\nwould be useful.&lt;br&gt;\nHowever, may systems do not require that set of capabi=\r\nlities. I don&#39;t&lt;br&gt;\nsee the method paramater as all that important.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nA get form is really just a specification for how to render a UI for =\r\na&lt;br&gt;\nURI template. For an automated user agent such a specification is&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nsuperflous, the same thing can be accomplished with just a link whose&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\ntarget is a URI template. (Possibly with a couple of extra resources&lt;br&gt;\nre=\r\npresenting the set of valid values for the various options.)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSimil=\r\narly, in the context of automated user agents, anything you can&lt;br&gt;\ndo with=\r\n a form, you can do without form by sufficiently specifying the&lt;br&gt;\nmedia t=\r\nype and/or relationships.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n(Though in some situations a form might =\r\nbetter than either of the&lt;br&gt;\nabove choices.)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ATOM:LINK@rel=\r\n=3D&quot;edit&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; means &quot;use this link to PUT or DELETE the=\r\n indicated resource using&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; guidlines set out in AtomPub&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; none of the RDF media types i have encountered have these affordance=\r\ns&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; built in; there is no universal way for servers to inform client=\r\ns of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the valid/appropriate possibilities at any point in time. Cli=\r\nents must&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; have this information hard-coded instead.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSo is=\r\n your point that no one has bothered to put together a decent RDF&lt;br&gt;\nbased=\r\n media type?  Or that it would be very difficult/impossible to do&lt;br&gt;\nso?&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThese affordances you&#39;ve mentioned are either built on link+@re=\r\nl which&lt;br&gt;\nis, at least to me, semantically indistinguishable from an RDF =\r\ntriple,&lt;br&gt;\nor they are media type specific, and therefore not &quot;univer=\r\nsal&quot;.  Even&lt;br&gt;\nthe ones that seem particularly distinctive don&#39;t =\r\nalways mean what&lt;br&gt;\nthey are specified to mean.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nFor example, if m=\r\ny automated user agent reads in an HTML page it does&lt;br&gt;\n*not* retrieve and=\r\n embed image resources linked to by that page.&lt;br&gt;\nNeither do the accelerat=\r\ning proxies though which it passes, they just&lt;br&gt;\nretrieve and cache. Inter=\r\nestingly they do exactly the same thing with&lt;br&gt;\nthe `a` tags in the HTML. =\r\nFor the proxies there is no distinction&lt;br&gt;\nbetween `img` and `a` tags exce=\r\npt perhaps in prioritization.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nPeter&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://barelyen=\r\nough.org&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://barelyenough.org&quot; target=\r\n=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;barelyenough.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n    &lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#fff;min-height:0&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\n/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\r\n--e89a8fb208982ca41d04b622c378--\r\n\n"}}
