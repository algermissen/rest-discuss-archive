The server occasionally gets duplicate \nrequests from clients, which, since these requests are not idempotent, \ncauses problems. I hypothesize that the double-requests are occuring \nwhen the server gets busy, and doesn&#39;t respond to a request within a \ncertain time frame, so the client (sometimes IE, sometimes our own \nsoftware) decides to resend the request. The two get queued up and \nhandled one right after each other by the server.\n\nI want to change the state-effecting operations to use POST, but to \njustify the change in the software, I&#39;m seeking evidence that using POST \nmight resolve this problem.\n\nAre web browsers prone to automatically resending GET requests, if they \ndon&#39;t hear back from the server within, say 5 seconds?  Or 30 seconds?  \nWill the same thing happen with a POST?  Thanks.\n\n-- \nLyle Kopnicky\nSoftware Project Engineer\nVeicon Technology, Inc.\n\n\n"}}
