That&#39;s the point that Walden is trying to get across. The \nSlashdot home page is the Slashdot home page whether it is in English or \nFrench (presuming that Slashdot was not totally US-centric), whether the \nuser has asked Google to turn off images or not, whether the user has \nasked Google to use a blue background or a red one.\n\nTrue, I cannot send you a URL and have you see Slashdot exactly the same \nway I do. If this is important then Slashdot could generate &quot;view&quot; URLs \nthat always returns the same view. But this is clearly not important for \nSlashdot so they don&#39;t bother.\n\nOne issue with the Web is that people tend not to be explicit about what \nresource the URI represents so you are left to guess about the \nuniversality and longevity of a representation you are looking at. You \ncould imagine an interface that would allow end-users to generate a \nURI/resource with the capabilities you want:\n\n&quot;I&#39;d like a URI for the Slashdot home page as it was three seconds ago \nwith my personalization applied (no matter who the user is).&quot;\n\nversus\n\n&quot;I&#39;d like a URI for the Slashdot home page with the latest stories on it \nand my personalization applied (no matter who the user is).&quot;\n\nversus\n\n&quot;I&#39;d like a URI for the Slashdot home page with the latest stories on it \nand the user&#39;s personalization applied.&quot;\n\nThis is probably overkill for 99% of all web sites so it isn&#39;t common. \nBut it shows how to address this personalization versus universality \nissue. Just make some resources personalized and some universal.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
