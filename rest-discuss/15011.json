I could come back 3 years later, \nand use those URIs it sent back to me and it should work. Is that not \ncorrect?\n\nAs for giving it to someone else, well, they would first have to pass \nauthentication as far as I know. But that does raise an interesting \nquestion. Using your example, how would the RESTful api &quot;prevent&quot; any call \nbeing made from anyone if they authenticate? That is, if you and I are both \nauthenticated users, and you pull a /orders with your info, and it gives you \na list back for your orders, you could then give me the URIs it returns, and \nI could make those same calls on your behalf, using my authentication. \nCorrect? My only guess is that every single call made to a RESTful API \nshould perform validation checks which would be expensive I suppose if every \ntime I tried to call one of your URIs for a specific order, the RESTful api \nhad to verify that the user making the call is the same user that received \nthe URIs in the first place. I am not sure if that makes sense, rereading \nit, but I am curious how this sort of issue is prevented. Generally, you\n wouldn&#39;t hand me your URIs that you got back, but a man-in-the-middle could \neasily catch those URIs (assuming that person defeated SSL when going over \nSSL). So how is such a scenario handled.. or should be handled by REST apis?\n\n\n\nConsider this situation: your are surfing the web and a friend of yours \ncomes by with an Amazon order ID. &quot;Could you please check this order for \nme?&quot; he says. &quot;Sure!&quot; you answer. Now what do you do? I am quite sure that \nyou are not going to type the direct Amazon order url into your browser - \nhow would you know what it should look like? But this is equivalent to your \nsuggested REST API consumer - when you pass it an order ID, it utilizes it&#39;s \napriori (&quot;at design time&quot;) knowledge of the REST API&#39;s URL structure.\n\n\n\nOn the user facing web you don&#39;t expect to have any knowledge of URL \nstructures. Instead you follow links, do searches, and let the end server \ncalculate the links for you. This is missing link in many REST APIs: they \nforce the client to completely understand the URL structure in order to use \nthe API. This in turns make the client brittle and will cause it to break \nthe first time REST API changes structure.\n\n\n\nSo for these reasons I cannot see other solutions than handing resource URLs \naround as parameters in my website URLs.\n\n\n\nWhat I am trying to, is to point out one of the consequences of consuming a \ntruely RESTful API. Namely that your API consumers cannot work with simple \nitem IDs, but have to pass complete resource URLs around.\n\n\n\n/Jørn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
