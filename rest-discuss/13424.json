Someone suggested naming things is not so  \n&gt; good, but I love doing so somethings to know what am I referring to.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, having all of you as REST fans, I wanted to present a  \n&gt; classification I did two days ago while riding the bus to work.  \n&gt; Silly? It may be, but I guess it helps understand where are we  \n&gt; standing in terms of REST usability and knowledge.\n&gt;\n&gt; API Makers: I find them everywhere. They have a system, usually not  \n&gt; built thinking on REST, and they want an API created. They usually  \n&gt; think REST is an API making technique or recipe, for the web.\n&gt; Subcategories:\n&gt;  - URI Jugglers. This are the ones that think REST is all about  \n&gt; creating URIs, and nothing more. So their discussions are solely  \n&gt; focused on URIs, and their presentations are about URIs definitions.\n&gt;  - RPCers. Bad group that think REST is a way to map RPC in disguise  \n&gt; using URIs in a web API. The most of them don&#39;t know they speak RPC  \n&gt; at all.\n&gt;  - Exposers: This type is repeated below. Those are the guys that  \n&gt; think you need to expose things in REST using resources. So REST is  \n&gt; an API for exposing things on the web.\n&gt;  - CRUDers: Another repeated group. They think REST is a web api for  \n&gt; CRUD. Simple.\n&gt;\n&gt; Mappers: This other category may use the API idea, but they actually  \n&gt; thing REST is a representation type and the work to be done is to  \n&gt; map all that is know used to that new type. Interesting?\n&gt;  - CRUDers. Again, the idea is that CRUD can be mapped naturally to  \n&gt; HTTP operations, and that\n&gt; makes it RESTful.\n&gt;  - HTTPers. They believe REST is HTTP. Deep enough.\n&gt;  - Exposers. Again too. They usually try to map all classes, data  \n&gt; entities, elements into resources, and then call their systems  \n&gt; RESTful.\n&gt;\n&gt; FAD followers?: This is a group of the reminders of the types.  \n&gt; Usually, they tend to follow a lead.\n&gt;  - Standard Haters: Here you have all those that think Standards are  \n&gt; evil and that REST is an anarchy where you have the freedom to do  \n&gt; whatever you like, so they follow REST doing whatever they want.\n&gt;  - KISS lovers. This are the ones that like thinks to be simple. And  \n&gt; someone told them REST is easy, so they follow doing easy things  \n&gt; with URIs. There are lots of URI jugglers in this group.\n&gt;  - Servicers. They think Services is good, and someone told them  \n&gt; REST is a way to do services without SOAP. So they follow.\n&gt;  - BuzzWorders. This is a vast majority. They like buzz words, so  \n&gt; they follow REST just because it is cool and all people talk about  \n&gt; it. There are some Buzz creators too, with thinks like ROA and REST  \n&gt; in WOA. No pun intended on REST-*\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there some one I&#39;m missing? Well, yes, probably the group that  \n&gt; knows REST as it actually is and understands it. That may be a one  \n&gt; person group (yes Roy).\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m may not be saying all those believes up there are wrong. I&#39;m NOT  \n&gt; saying they are good, at all.\n&gt;\n&gt; What do you think? Do you find yourself in any of those groups?\n&gt;\n&gt; William Martinez Pomares.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n--------------------------------------\nJan Algermissen\n\nMail: algermissen@...\nBlog: http://algermissen.blogspot.com/\nHome: http://www.jalgermissen.com\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n"}}
