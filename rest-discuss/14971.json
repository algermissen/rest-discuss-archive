The authorization schemes I \n&gt; &gt;&gt; have seen so far usually=\r\n encodes a user reference and nothing more \n&gt; &gt;&gt; - there&#39;s no secure way to=\r\n assert claims like email=3Dxxx@... \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;mailto:email%3Dxxx%40yyy.zz&gt; or\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; employeenumber=3D12345 or age-below-twenty.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I guess you can =\r\nuse SAML &quot;HTTP Redirect (GET) Binding&quot;, but that \n&gt; &gt;&gt; generates such a hug=\r\ne URL that it seems impractical to use (it&#39;s a \n&gt; &gt;&gt; base-64 encoding of a =\r\nzip-encoding of a SAML XML document).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; As I understand it a RESTfu=\r\nl authorization scheme must be \n&gt; &gt;&gt; stateless, so you cannot rely on any k=\r\nind of session use. This \n&gt; &gt;&gt; means you have to transfer all the claims on=\r\n each and every request \n&gt; &gt;&gt; which again means a potentially big overhead.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; What is needed is a standard way of encoding multiple claims in =\r\na \n&gt; &gt;&gt; compact, secure, trusted way such that they can be transferred on \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; each request without too much overhead (including whatever crypto \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; stuff is needed).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Maybe you could create a temporary ressource =\r\nsomewhere with the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; claims, then at least you only had to transfer the=\r\n claims URL, not \n&gt; &gt;&gt; all the claims, and the server could then cache thes=\r\ne claims.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Any ideas or references?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; It even occurs to me=\r\n that claims could be more RESTful than \n&gt; &gt;&gt; username/password since they =\r\ndon&#39;t require any out-of-band setup of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; user accounts. All that is nee=\r\nded is a standard for claims and then \n&gt; &gt;&gt; everything should work if the c=\r\nlaims are issued by an authority \n&gt; &gt;&gt; that the web service trusts. No need=\r\n for any human interaction - \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the server just sends a challenge &quot;show =\r\nme your claims (and I \n&gt; &gt;&gt; accept them from authority X, Y and Z)&quot; whereaf=\r\nter the client sends \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the claims. These claims can even be obtained wi=\r\nthout human \n&gt; &gt;&gt; interaction if the client and the claims server trust eac=\r\nh other.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Comments?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks, J=F8rn\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -----=\r\n-------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
