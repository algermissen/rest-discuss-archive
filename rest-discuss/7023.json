WTF? I mean, this problem&#39;s as\n&gt;&gt; old as the web, distributing named userspace directories /~someuser/ across\n&gt;&gt; multiple servers has long been a problem *with a solution* that doesn&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; inconvenience users like this!\n&gt; I noticed that Amazon&#39;s S3 storage system recently did something\n&gt; similar. However, there is more to &#39;user directories&#39; than\n&gt; partitioning the URI across back end machines. \n\n[... example of partitioning authority by domains ...]\n\n\nPerhaps the biggest reason to having personalised domain is\npsychological, not technical.\n\nWhich one appeals more to you?\nhttp://yourbigcorporate.com/~yourname --OR--\nhttp://yourname.yourbigcorporate.com  ?\n\n&quot;What&#39;s in a name?&quot; is an apt question here. Vanity is the game, and\nmillions of dollars have been spent playing it (how much did sex.com\nsell for?).\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/4j9e                (free)       --OR--\nhttp://somehostingcompany.com/biz/sex  ($20/month)  --OR--\nhttp://sex.com                         (some six-digit figure)\n\n\n\n\nThere is another benefit to having personalised domain. In my previous\ncompany, each employee gets his own domain. I got\nysantoso.company.net.\n\nAlong with it, I have control over the subdomains:\n\nMy homepage was http://ysantoso.company.com instead of \nhttp://company.com/employee/ysantoso.\n\nI could FTP directly to ftp.ysantoso.company.com instead of\nftp-ing to company.com and issuing a &quot;cd ysantoso&quot;.\n\nI also had many mailboxes:\nurgent@... -- forwards messages to my pager\nfriend@... -- what I gave to friends\njunk@...   -- what I entered for various website registrations\noffice@... -- I hand this out in business card\ntodo@...   -- piped to my TODO program\nrest-discuss@...  -- mails from rest-discuss group.\n\nWhy stop personalising at employee, why not give softwares\npersonalised domain too?\n\nbug@...    -- automatically file bug for a software titled &quot;vaporware&quot;.\n\n\n\nIn short, personalisation is an effective and attractive\ngimmick. Microsoft&#39;s excuse for going to personalised domain may be\nlame. But the end product, personalised domain, is far from being lame\nand has yet to be taken advantage of by public.\n\n\n\nYS.\n\n"}}
