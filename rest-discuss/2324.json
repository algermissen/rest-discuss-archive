There is no &quot;correct&quot;\nanswer, or even a &quot;best&quot; answer.  It all depends on your application.\n\nDoctrine says: URIs should be considered as opaque.  A URI like\nhttp://my.server.com/x742q/32ij5 might refer to &quot;sub-element foo of\nsub-element bar of element xyzzy&quot;.  Or not.\n\nCertainly I don&#39;t recommend explicit opaqueness as the Right approach\nin all cases.  Embedding meaning in URIs can often be helpful, and\nimprove application performance by avoiding the need for extra lookups\nin your code.  But this is outside of the scope of REST.\n\nAppropriate punctuation (/ and ? and &) may be driven by your\napplication as well.  Is the structure pre-defined, or does it grow\nand change over time?  Is the concept of searching even relevant, and\ncan searches be made over sub-trees as well as the whole hierarchy? \nAre attributes defined from a fixed set, or are these variable as well?\n\nThere&#39;s no right answer here.\n\n-Jason\n\n\n\n--- In rest-discuss@y..., &quot;Yannick Loiseau&quot; &lt;yloiseau@f...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; How to represent hierarchical resources restfully?\n&gt; [lengthy post snipped]\n\n\n\n"}}
