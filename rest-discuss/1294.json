Mike Dierken wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It is a bit ironic that a set of architectural practices under the title of\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Representation State Transfer&quot; defines virtually nothing about the way in\n&gt;&gt; which state is to be represented, and instead focuses on how Objects (or\n&gt;&gt; more precisely, resources) are to be accessed.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t think that many architectures define representations. You know -\n&gt; &#39;architecture&#39; &#39;design&#39; &#39;implementation&#39; - there is a reason that there are\n&gt; three different words... I don&#39;t think it is a pedantic/semantic argument\n&gt; either. Other architectures (&#39;event based integration&#39;, &#39;remote procedure\n&gt; call&#39;) do not define the details - a particular design or implementation of\n&gt; the architecture does (there are several RPC systems that have different\n&gt; representations - yet they are all recognizably &#39;rpc&#39;).\n\nAgreed.\n\nI am actually trying to tease out the distinction between REST and HTTP.  I\nsee people outraged when SOAP uses POST when it could have equally validly\nused GET.  Few of these people seem outraged when GET is used in a\nnon-idempotent manner.  In many cases, this makes me wonder if the thing\nmost people find appealing is actually the concept of a URI and not of the\nunderlying architecture or even the validity of the usage of HTTP.\n\nIn contrast, I find the statement in the Rest Wiki\n(http://conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/RestArchitecturalStyle) that Rest\nmost closely resembles tuplspaces - an architecture in which there is no\nidentifiable resources, and one in which all routing is based on content.\nA vision which is not terribly dissimilar from the one that Adam Bosworth\nexposes at\nhttp://www.fawcette.com/xmlmag/2002_04/magazine/departments/endtag/default.asp\n\n- Sam Ruby\n\n\n"}}
