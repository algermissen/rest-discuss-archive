That&#39;s\nwhy it is frowned upon to &quot;know how&quot; to build the URLs. Whatever\nknowledge you have encoded in your application about URLs can change\nbehind your back, this breaking your application.\n\nFor example, do you know the structure of the URLs for Amazon? Some\nmay think they do, but most folks simply don&#39;t because they just\nfollow links to get things done. The URLs are meaningless to them.\nIf/When Amazon changes their URLs, you can see how if the page layout\nitself does not change, the user isn&#39;t impacted at all on using\nAmazons system.\n\nIf you application is designed to &quot;follow&quot; URLs rather than make them,\nthen your application has a similar level of robust behavior.\n\n&gt; If this is the case.. Shall we rather say that there&#39;s no RESTful API&#39;s but RESTful clients of a particular API?\n\nThe API is the combination of data types and how to interpret those\ndata types for your application. If your application is going to\nfollow URLs, it will need to know what parts of the payloads are the\nURLs to follow. That knowledge is part of the API, not the URLs\nthemselves.\n\nNow, obviously, in the real world, as much as the goal is to have\nopaque URLs, there is likely some leakage of constructing rules if for\nno other reason than to start the whole process chain, to know what\ninitial URL to send to start the work.\n\nSo, in those case, the URLs are important. But once started, they shouldn&#39;t be.\n\n&gt; Why many people (like myself, in the case that things stated above are true) have such a misconception of REST?\n\nBecause most people stopped learning about REST when they saw &quot;Oh,\nsend and recieve data over HTTP using &quot;pretty&quot; URLs. How hard can it\nbe?&quot; and then all the toolkits worked on making &quot;pretty URLs&quot; easier.\nWhen in fact the URLs are an implementation detail secondary to the\noverall architecture.\n\nDid you read the dissertation?\n\nIf you read the dissertation, it&#39;s quite a bit longer than what would\nbe necessary to simply promote RPC via pretty URLs.\n\nIf you haven&#39;t read the thesis, you should.\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm\n\nSubbu&#39;s article on InfoQ will also probably be eye opening as well:\nhttp://www.infoq.com/articles/subbu-allamaraju-rest\n\nRegards,\n\nWill Hartung\n(willh@...)\n\n"}}
