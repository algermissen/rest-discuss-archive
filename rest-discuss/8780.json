In a\n&gt; desktop scenario it is feasible and acceptable to have strong\n&gt; coupling, because you have a much narrower domain of artifacts and\n&gt; more control over how those artifacts can behave. In a network\n&gt; environment you have heterogeneous systems with different\n&gt; architectures and approaches, so loose coupling is much more likely\n&gt; to succeed.\n\nThat&#39;s the first assumption to question. Yes, you still only have one\nsysadmin, but you do have very weak ability to do synchronous update\nof all app versions on a single box. Hence DLL hell, RPM hell, JAR\nhell, and whatever the equivalent for OSGi we are yet to see.\n\nNetKernel and Cocoon both use loosely coupled XML pipelines inside a\nsingle process, because shovelling XML between bits of code is both\nsimple to do and gives better isolation between parts. Similarly,\nAnt&#39;s XML language is much less brittle than the Java APIs.\n\nand then there is the best example of all, the Unix pipe, where space,\ncomma or tab separate lines provide a wire format that is app neutral.\n\nPremise 1: Loose coupling between libraries on a single process or\nmachine can provide benefits.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; People have used distributed technologies to build desktop\n&gt; applications in the past. For example, there&#39;s the CORBA\n&gt; infrastructure in GNOME, the now defunct Berlin project, and the\n&gt; various bus- and queue-based inter-application messaging frameworks\n&gt; in BSD, Solaris, etc. Those technologies, however, are still used in\n&gt; a very fine-grained, strongly coupled manner.\n\nCorba actually came out of Distributed NewWave and Sun&#39;s equivalent:\nit was desktops that drove them, or at least the impressive demos.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I do agree with you that there are lessons to be learned from the\n&gt; interoperability measures and standardisation that has developed in\n&gt; the web space. If all filesystems were able to store MIME content-\n&gt; type and other metadata, it would simplify building cross-platform\n&gt; applications. I&#39;m less sure about your concept of bookmarks for\n&gt; entire application state identified by &quot;LRLs&quot; or the general\n&gt; applicability of REST principles to desktop applications.\n&gt;\n\n\nOne interesting thought is what role Atom could have on the desktop.\nThere are always various pub/sub mechanisms (windows has COM+ and\nSENS, linux is adopting DBus). What if lots of things were feed\nsources, other things transforms and finally ways of presenting stuff\nto the user. . you could have some fun there, which is good, because\noperating systems have got, well, dull.\n\n-steve\n\n"}}
