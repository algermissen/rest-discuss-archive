Do they need to know the names (&quot;Widget A&quot;, &quot;Widget B&quot;)\nassociated with each href? What will they do with them? Will they need\nextra information to filter down the list you give them to a more\nappropriate set? If the answer to any of these questions is &quot;yes, we\nneed special data&quot; then you have moved away from REST and into the world\nof Plain Old XML. REST is mostly about being able to transfer\nrepresentations that everyone can understand because it corresponds to a\nproblem set that everyone has.\n\nYou are starting out with hyperlinks, and that is great. That is the\ncrux of discoverability. If your hyperlinks will be navigable by machine\n(no human in the loop) you will probably need a custom XML format to\npresent the extra data they might need. If you are sure they won&#39;t need\nany extra data, you could use a simple url list (as in, the media type).\nAlternatively, you could use good old xhtml:\n&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;1234/&quot;&gt;Widget A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;1235/&quot;&gt;Widget B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nYou can&#39;t get any more standard than that, and it fulfils the use case\nyou have described so far. This is essentially XOXO[1], but another\nmicroformats possibility is xFolk[2]. This would allow you to add your\nown tags to the links you describe, as follows. You can allow clients to\ntell the difference between a forklift and a spanner:\n&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n    &lt;li class=&quot;xfolkentry&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&lt;a class=&quot;taggedlink&quot; href=&quot;1234/&quot;&gt;Widget A&lt;/a&gt;\n\t\t(&lt;a href=&quot;http://you.example.org/spanner&quot;&gt;spanner&lt;/a&gt;)\n\t&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li class=&quot;xfolkentry&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&lt;a class=&quot;taggedlink&quot; href=&quot;1235/&quot;&gt;Widget B&lt;/a&gt;\n\t\t(&lt;a href=&quot;http://you.example.org/spanner&quot;&gt;forklift&lt;/a&gt;)\n\t&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nMy personal feeling is that the closer you get to behaving like the web\nthe more RESTful you are. The more you focus on machine to machin comms\nwithout any human involved, the less RESTful you are. It is often better\nto transfer a snippet of HTML that a human can read than a snippet of\nxml that a program can parse and process for its human to read.\nMicroformats find a neat balance by ensuring that machines can still\nextract data out of the human-readable content where they need it to do\ntheir processing.\n\n-- \nBenjamin Carlyle &lt;benjamincarlyle@...&gt;\n[1] http://microformats.org/wiki/xoxo\n[2] http://microformats.org/wiki/xfolk\n\n\n"}}
