Can I assume you haven&#39;t been reading my URL blog? (of course, I assume\nsomeone hasn&#39;t until they tell me otherwise.) There I have tried to explain\nwhy non-obtuse URLs are important. Maybe I haven&#39;t done the best job I could\nhave, but that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been doing for a while now.\n\n2.) I agree with Jon Hanna: &quot;It&#39;s always appropriate to use non-obtuse URLs&quot;\nso I wouldn&#39;t ever be explaining when it *is* approriate. :)  \n\nInterestingly my last post [1] was on this issue, and I&#39;ve had quite an\ninteresting comment debate going with one of the Seaside true believers.  He\nsaid \n\n\t&quot;I understand your position, \n\tbut all of your arguments are \n\tbased on the idea that REST is \n\tthe only correct architecture, \n\tand that simply isn&#39;t true. REST \n\tis an architecture, one among \n\tmany, and each has advantages \n\tand disadvantages. Every URL \n\tsimply does not need to be restful.&quot;  \n\nI&#39;d actually greatly appreciate anyone and everyone on this list read the\npost and comments, and if you feel compelled, to add your voice as a\ncomment, even if you disagree with me or feel I was being overly harsh.\n\n&gt; Also, when you meet people in person or on mailing lists that \n&gt; promote the idea that obtuse URLs are the one true way, you \n&gt; should point out counter examples.\n\nOh, I do. I do! :-)\n\n&gt; First they ignore you, then they laugh at you...\n\n.. then they fight you, then you win.  :-)\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org - http://t.oolicio.us\n\n[1]\nhttp://blog.welldesignedurls.org/2007/05/19/seeing-things-the-way-in-which-o\nne-wants-them-to-be-not-the-way-they-are/\n\n\n"}}
