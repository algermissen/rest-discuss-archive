Fielding &lt;fielding@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n[. . .]\n&gt; REST simplifies applications because it rips apart the million\n&gt; potential states inherent in any serious application and presents\n&gt; to the client only one at a time, with every single transition\n&gt; from that state described in a format that can be understood by\n&gt; the client as a potential transition.  The client is completely\n&gt; decoupled from the server aside from the shared agreement on what\n&gt; each media type means.  The entire application only needs to be\n&gt; understood (and can be completely tested) one state at a time.\n&gt;\nThis is where I get a little confused.\n\nI assume that the client still needs to understand each of the possible\nstates so that it knows what to do with/at each of those states.  I also\nassume that the client needs to understand what each of the transitions\n(links)  out of the current state means so that it can determine which one\nto follow.\n\nWhat happens when the application evolves to include a new\nstate?  How does the client figure out what to do with that new state?\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n&gt; The only difference between machine-to-machine interaction and\n&gt; human-browser interaction is the choice of media types and the\n&gt; degree to which the potential transitions are described by those\n&gt; types. A browser knows the difference between an anchor and an\n&gt; in-line image because the media type standard defines that difference.\n&gt; It doesn&#39;t have to ask the user each time whether they want a\n&gt; given relationship to be treated as an in-line image, stylesheet,\n&gt; javascript, atom subscription, or any of the other relationships\n&gt; that are automated with even browser-based hypermedia.  A pure\n&gt; machine-to-machine simply automates all transitions based on\n&gt; some predefined (or adaptive) criteria that is evaluated for\n&gt; each representation received.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hypermedia means the placement of controls within the presentation\n&gt; of information -- it is not just a GUI paradigm.\n&gt;\n\n"}}
