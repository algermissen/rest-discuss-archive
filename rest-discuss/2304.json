I think that&#39;s one of\nthe key reasons many developers (myself included) have such a hard time\ngetting their heads wrapped around REST.  We&#39;re used to Object-Oriented\nDevelopment, so SOAP/RPC is just a natural extension of that.  We try to\nuse REST and suddenly we are faced with a completely different paradigm,\nResource-Oriented Development.\n\nLike it or not, I think that&#39;s one advantage SOAP/RPC will have over\nREST.  Forcing Java/C++/C# developers to use one paradigm for their\nregular development, and switch to another for their network-based\ndevelopment is not very appealing. \n\nSo, one &quot;When REST should not be used&quot; guideline could be: When you\ndon&#39;t want to force your developers to learn a new paradigm.\n\nToivo Lainevool\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Mathews, Walden [mailto:waldenm@...] \nSent: Friday, August 30, 2002 10:50 AM\nTo: &#39;Sam Hunting&#39;; Jeffrey Winter\nCc: Mark Baker; bhaugen32; rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [rest-discuss] When REST should and should not be used Was:\nEvidence\n\nREST was designated as an architecture, but there&#39;s an implied\ndevelopment method akin to object design methods that we seem to be\napplying in the name of REST.  Resource orientation might be the\nname of that method.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
