Go for it.  Nothing stops you from usin=\r\ng\ncontent negotiation to provide other formats within the scope of your\nser=\r\nvice.\n\nJust remember that when you extend it with\nyour own markup, you shou=\r\nld use appropriate message metadata / extended\nMIME media types you use to =\r\nencompass your extensions.\n\n\nCheers,\nPeter\n\n \n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----=\r\n\n&gt; From: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; [mailto:rest-discuss@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom] On Behalf Of Kristian Rink\n&gt; Sent: May 29, 2012 09:23\n&gt; To: Rest List\n&gt;=\r\n Subject: [rest-discuss] ATOM Pub vs. JSON vs. ...?\n&gt; \n&gt; Folks;\n&gt; \n&gt; I am a=\r\nt the moment into trying to choose a data format / \n&gt; representation to use=\r\n for building a RESTful web service \n&gt; which should allow for reading and w=\r\nriting resources, which \n&gt; should be accessible using &quot;standard&quot; tools as w=\r\nell as using \n&gt; a dedicated programming API and which should as much as \n&gt; =\r\nsomewhat possible rely upon existing open standards.\n&gt; \n&gt; After doing some =\r\nreading, I came across Atom and APP as it \n&gt; seems in many possible ways pr=\r\novide sane and stable solutions \n&gt; for problems at hand (including things l=\r\nike &quot;workspaces&quot;, \n&gt; &quot;feeds&quot;, &quot;entries&quot;, dealing with service and category =\r\n\n&gt; descriptions, dealing with textual and binary content, \n&gt; dealing with e=\r\nxtensibility and stuff like OpenSearch and the like).\n&gt; \n&gt; In many ways, so=\r\n far it seems the perfect match, however it \n&gt; right now (at least for me) =\r\nsuffers from a particular \n&gt; shortcoming: I am not really sure whether it&#39;s=\r\n a technology \n&gt; or a standard to &quot;last&quot;. Doing some reading on that, I rat=\r\nher \n&gt; quickly stumbled across articles pointing out that &quot;AtomPub \n&gt; has f=\r\nailed&quot; and &quot;AtomPub is basically dead&quot;, suggesting that \n&gt; everyone else us=\r\nes JSON based REST services right now, \n&gt; eventually pointing out that even=\r\n the Google GData services \n&gt; are considered &quot;legacy&quot; \n&gt; and replaced by di=\r\nfferent approaches right now. On the other \n&gt; hand I don&#39;t really see what =\r\ncould replace Atom or especially \n&gt; AtomPub talking about providing a given=\r\n data structure, a \n&gt; data and service semantics to allow for read/write \n&gt;=\r\n interactions with a service in a somewhat sane, standard way.\n&gt; \n&gt; So to a=\r\nsk: If you were about to start a new RESTful project \n&gt; supposed to work wi=\r\nth existing &quot;standard&quot; tools, what kind of \n&gt; data representation would you=\r\n choose? Would you still go for \n&gt; Atom / AtomPub? Would you rather use som=\r\ne kind of JSON+HTTP? \n&gt; Something completely else?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance f=\r\nor any input,\n&gt; Kristian\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nYahoo!
