One school of thought suggests coarse gr=\r\nained media types meaning using application/xml, text/html etc etc.  While =\r\nthe other promotes and shows examples of refined media types that reflect t=\r\nhe domain in which they are being used in e.g. application/vnd.order+xml.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; I see possible pros/cons to both approaches but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve seen =\r\nan actual discussion targeted at discussing this matter (other than certain=\r\n threads on other topics delving into the issue).\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyone want to take =\r\nthe first shot at backing a certain approach publicly?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Eb=\r\n\n&gt;\n\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/6596 ;-)\n\nA key=\r\n problem with using application/xml is that if everyone did that then how c=\r\nould you do any content negotiation between two distinct but XML-based form=\r\nats?\n\nBut I don&#39;t think you need to be overly specific with the media types=\r\n either. i.e. application/vnd.store+xml rather than application/vnd.custome=\r\nr+xml, application/vnd.order+xml and application/vnd.product+xml and so on =\r\nis too fine grained IMO. It becomes quite onerous to extend your applicatio=\r\nn at that level of media type granularity. \n\nWhere to draw the line? If it =\r\nis important to make the type distinction in an intermediary or a connector=\r\n, or in content negotiation then differentiate in the headers (use two dist=\r\ninct media types). If the distinction is only important when you are proces=\r\nsing the document anyways (e.g. in the client, server or an intermediary th=\r\nat does deep content processing such as format translation) then you don&#39;t =\r\nneed to make the distinction in your headers.\n\nThat&#39;s my take anyways. I&#39;m =\r\ncurious to hear what others think.\nRegards,\n\nAndrew\n\n\n"}}
