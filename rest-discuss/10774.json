It comes down to the result of having httpRange-14. If=\r\n you get a 200, you have an Informational Resource, whereas an RDF is a doc=\r\nument about a resource that is most certainly not a resource representation=\r\n.\n\nSeems the TAG is of the idea that every _thing_ should 303 so you can ma=\r\nke assertion on Uris that return 200. And an RDF is not a representation of=\r\n a resource, but an informational resource about a resource, with its own U=\r\nri. Hence why the Link: header is being reintroduced, with the fallacious a=\r\nrgument that it was in the previous http spec and lack of time was the reas=\r\non for it not being included in 2616. That no one had the time to go over 2=\r\n616 again and that 2616 doesn&#39;t complement 2068 but supersedes it seems to =\r\nbe conveniently ignored. \n\nThat said, many people are happy not living in h=\r\nttpRange-14 and serving any resource about a resource, and resource attache=\r\nd to a resource, through conneg. I used to be fine with it, but if you star=\r\nt doing it with RDF, you would do it with css, and it can become quite a me=\r\nss, as they&#39;re essentially different documents, not different representatio=\r\nns of the same resource.\n\nTo wrap up: with httpRange-14 you should never re=\r\nturn a 200 from a resource that is not a document, and use only a 303. Rela=\r\nted documents can be added using the Link: http header (even though it&#39;s cu=\r\nrrent standardized status is discussable at best, and one cannot rely on th=\r\ne intent of the author more than on the publication). Link in HTML and the =\r\nXHTML families are still there for that, as well as in ATOM feeds.\n\nIf you =\r\nwant to be more flexible, you would argue that the following two are equiva=\r\nlent:\n  - The httpRange-14 way -\n=3D&gt;\nGET /resource\nAccept: text/html\n&lt;=3D\n=\r\n303 Location: /resource.html\n=3D&gt;\nGET /resource.html\n&lt;=3D\n200 Ok &lt;- httpRan=\r\nge-14 assertion that /resource.html is not a thing but an IR, aka a documen=\r\nt\n\n\n  - Another way to assert the same thing:\n=3D&gt;\nGET /resource\nAccept: te=\r\nxt/html\n&lt;=3D\n200 Ok\nContent-Location: /resource.html &lt;- you do your asserti=\r\non on the Content-Location, not on the url you requested\n\nFrom the discussi=\r\nons I had with a couple of people, this method is not accepted for reasons =\r\nI still don&#39;t understand.\n\nSo it&#39;s fine to do your conneg on different mime=\r\ntypes for your resources, *provided* they are different representations of =\r\na same resource.\n\nCss and Rdf *are not* different representations of a same=\r\n resource and should *never* share the same url. Use Link: header, and the =\r\ncapabilities of your representation (html and xhtml, atom and others) to li=\r\nnk to other documents.\n\nAs for the alternate documents, see\nhttp://www.w3.o=\r\nrg/2001/tag/doc/alternatives-discovery.html\n\nand something I quite like mys=\r\nelf (because it has the quality of existing): rfc2295 at http://rfc.net/rfc=\r\n2295.html .\n\n\n--\nSerialSeb\n\n\n\n"}}
