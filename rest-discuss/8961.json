This is largely due to the\nfact that REST is specific to HTTP (i.e. HTTP has an action header\nthat can be used for the same purpose, or an associated URI) whereas\nWeb services are multi-protocol and therefore need all information to\nbe contained within the envelope. Some of the fundamental differences\nresult from these different assumptions: REST assumes HTTP while WS-*\nassumes protocol neutrality. Others result from the fact that HTTP\nintentionally designs out features of existing IT systems (e.g.\nsession based security, transaction coordination, reliability, etc.)\nand that the WS-* specifications basically amount to an attempt to put\nthem back in.&quot;\n\nfunniest quotes\n\n&quot;the major goal of WS-* is interoperability and if you don&#39;t need\ninteroperability you don&#39;t really need WS-*.&quot;\n\nAnd, after much praise of WS-Addressing and its rapid standardisation\n(==the reality that there are 3-4 different versions out there, and\nWS-DM 1.0 depends on two different versions), finally a note that\n&quot;there was consensus surrounding EPRs was that vendors should show\ncare in using EPRs&quot;\n\nso, lots of interesting papers, but this summary is pretty\ndisappointing. I wonder if this was the actual outcome of the\nworkshop, or merely the opinons of those who volunteered to write it\nup. As it is, it is more a &quot;there are some problems with WS-*, but we\ncan fix them&quot; rather than some discussion on how best to use REST as\nan architecture for behind-the-firewall systems.\n\n-steve\n\n\n \n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0AC5_01C7ACFA.173095D0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;us-ascii&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.=\r\nw3c.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/loose.dtd&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;META http-eq=\r\nuiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Dus-ascii&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- Network c=\r\nontent --&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.6000.16441&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;BODY style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;S=\r\nPAN class=3D968371216-11062007&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \ncolor=3D#0000ff size=3D2=\r\n&gt;It&#39;s funny the way these things happen.&nbsp; I said a few \nthings that I&#39;=\r\nm still surprised people didn&#39;t really agree with or pick up \non..&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/=\r\nSPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3D968371216-11062007&gt;&lt;F=\r\nONT face=3DArial \ncolor=3D#0000ff size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV =\r\ndir=3Dltr align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3D968371216-11062007&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial =\r\n\ncolor=3D#0000ff size=3D2&gt;&lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.pacificspirit.com/blog/200=\r\n7/03/06/w3c_web_of_services_for_enterprise_computing&quot;&gt;http://www.pacificspi=\r\nrit.com/blog/2007/03/06/w3c_web_of_services_for_enterprise_computing&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/F=\r\nONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3D968371216-11062=\r\n007&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \ncolor=3D#0000ff size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3D968371216-11062007&gt;&lt;FONT face=3D=\r\nArial \ncolor=3D#0000ff size=3D2&gt;Cheers,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr =\r\nalign=3Dleft&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3D968371216-11062007&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \ncolor=3D#=\r\n0000ff size=3D2&gt;Dave&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE \nstyle=3D&quot;PADDING-=\r\nLEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: #0000ff 2px solid; MARGIN-RIGHT: =\r\n0px&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;DIV class=3DOutlookMessageHeader lang=3Den-us dir=3Dltr align=3Dle=\r\nft&gt;\n  &lt;HR tabIndex=3D-1&gt;\n  &lt;FONT face=3DTahoma size=3D2&gt;&lt;B&gt;From:&lt;/B&gt; rest-d=\r\niscuss@yahoogroups.com \n  [mailto:rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com] &lt;B&gt;On Behal=\r\nf Of &lt;/B&gt;Steve \n  Loughran&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sent:&lt;/B&gt; Saturday, June 09, 2007 2:07 PM&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;B&gt;To:&lt;/B&gt; Rest \n  List&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Subject:&lt;/B&gt; [rest-discuss] Web of Service=\r\ns for Enterprise \n  Computing&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV id=\r\n=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n  &lt;P&gt;Report of this meeting is up online: &lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;http:=\r\n//www.w3.org/2007/04/wsec_report&quot;&gt;http://www.w3.&lt;WBR&gt;org/2007/&lt;WBR&gt;04/wsec_=\r\nreport&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Given \n  the presentations we saw, its a bit of a disappo=\r\ninting writeup;&lt;BR&gt;there are \n  definately some statements about the value =\r\nof SOAP1.2,&lt;BR&gt;WSDL2.0 and, in \n  particular, WS-A that surprised me, and w=\r\nhich went&lt;BR&gt;alongside some \n  misunderstandings of REST&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;The origin=\r\nal goal of SOAP has much in common \n  with REST and in fact&lt;BR&gt;certain inte=\r\nrpretations of the specifications cite \n  the major&lt;BR&gt;difference being SOA=\r\nP allows the definition of a method or \n  operation&lt;BR&gt;name within the mess=\r\nage and REST does not.
