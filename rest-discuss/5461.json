I don&#39;t see why PUT has\n&gt; to mean &quot;place this representation\n&gt; here&quot; when it could mean &quot;use this\n&gt; representation to update this resource&quot;.\n\nNo. The HTTP spec (Sect 9.6) is quite clear ...\n\nftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2616.txt\n\n&quot;The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the\n supplied Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already\n existing resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a\n modified version of the one residing on the origin server. If the\n Request-URI does not point to an existing resource, and that URI is\n capable of being defined as a new resource by the requesting user\n agent, the origin server can create the resource with that URI.&quot;\n\nI know because I already asked the same question.\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/4372\n\nRegards\nDonald.\n\n\n"}}
