If you want to provide a counter-example, so be it.\nIf not, that&#39;s fine too.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This definition holds for FTP, HTTP, SMTP, NNTP etc. It doesn&#39;t hold for\n&gt; &gt; SOAP, DCOM, RMI, etc. Individual applications *built on top of* SOAP,\n&gt; &gt; DCOM, and RMI should have ports.\n&gt; \n&gt; My perception is that amazon.com&#39;s shopping basket is an application built\n&gt; upon HTTP.  Care to comment?\n\nAmazon.com&#39;s shopping basket is a software application built on top of\nthe HTTP application protocol. The addressing model and methods for the\napplication come from the HTTP application protocol. HTTP does not\naddress the payload syntax but neither do (nor can!) NNTP, POP, IMAP or\nthe other application protocols.\n\n&gt; &gt; Summary: You can build synchrony on top of asynchrony or vice versa.\n&gt; \n&gt; I view that statement as akin to the statement that all computers are\n&gt; Turing complete.  A true statement, but one that misses a number of\n&gt; important subtleties.\n\nWhich subtleties in particular do you feel are relevant?\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
