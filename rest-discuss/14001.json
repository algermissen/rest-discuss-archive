Hey -- maybe CCXML isn&#39;t RESTful after all; it certainly has a  \n&gt; different flavor than most of the media types coming from the REST  \n&gt; community. I&#39;d love to get all of your feedback; maybe I&#39;m missing  \n&gt; something. But if it isn&#39;t then perhaps the as yet to be formally  \n&gt; defined style behind CCXML is a good alternative to REST for machine  \n&gt; to machine interaction. It certainly seems to have many of the  \n&gt; properties most readers of this list are looking for.\n\n\n From the TR: &quot;A CCXML session begins with the execution of a CCXML  \ndocument.&quot;\n\nNow, my understanding might be wrong because I dod not have the time  \nto put my head into the spec, but the above quote sounds a lot like  \nthat the coordination between components in CCXML is achieved by  \npassing code (executable documents) around. To be RESTful the  \ncoordination should be achieved by passing representations of state  \naround.\n\nCan you provide us with an example of a typical interaction?\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------\nJan Algermissen\n\nMail: algermissen@...\nBlog: http://algermissen.blogspot.com/\nHome: http://www.jalgermissen.com\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n"}}
