There can\n&gt;&gt;&gt; be no doubt that self-descriptive = registered and points to a spec.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; application/vnd.contact+json\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; At least RFC 3023 defines +xml syntax -- +json is defined where,\n&gt;&gt; again?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-02\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t really claim to have &quot;defined&quot; +json syntax, I just followed\n&gt; the clear existing precedence set by +xml with JSON Schema I-D.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, I would argue that the JSON Schema I-D&#39;s suggested (not\n&gt; normatively defined, but recommended) use of the &quot;profile&quot; media type\n&gt; parameter provides a smart combination of base media types with a\n&gt; URL-based discoverability of mechanically understandable aspects of\n&gt; the media type definition. The profile media type can reference a\n&gt; schema that defines how hyperlinks are expressed (and the relation\n&gt; name), how the data can be modified and retain a correct structure.\n&gt; \n&gt; application/my.media.type+json;profile=http://my.media.com/my-schema\n\nis the my.media.type really needed? why not simply:\n\n   application/json;profile=http://my.media.com/my-schema\n\nor a Link &quot;describedby&quot; as suggested by the draft.\n\nNote that there may be some conflation with using describedby, it&#39;s also \nused often to point to an RDF document describing the resource. It may \nbe worth thinking whether there is a case for a &#39;profile&#39; or &#39;schema&#39; \nlink relation.\n\n&gt; There are multiple levels of &quot;understanding&quot; a media type. You can\n&gt; understand the grammer (JSON or XML), understand how to interpret\n&gt; hyperlinks, how the data is constrained, how it should or could be\n&gt; visually represented, and so on. Each level of understanding can give\n&gt; the user agents progressively more power to provide a helpful user\n&gt; interface to the user.\n\nIt may be worth figuring out whether the common case for these dialects \nwould need to be in the media type (so that it can be negotiated over) \nor whether it&#39;s additional response information that can help an \napplication work with the entity. I&#39;d suggest that it&#39;s probably the latter.\n\nBest & thanks for your reply,\n\nNathan\n\n"}}
