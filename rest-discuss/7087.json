No.\n&gt;\n&gt; RPC has been tried again and again and again. Like Bullwinkle pulling a\n&gt; rabbit out of a hat, that trick never works. Anyone remember CORBA?\n&gt; DCOM? RMI? Sprinkling a little magic HTTP pixie dust over a bad idea\n&gt; doesn&#39;t fix it.\n&gt;\n&gt; REST is an alternative to the WS-splat insanity. It is *not* yet another\n&gt; a way to do distributed objects. It is an alternative to distributed\n&gt; objects and tightly coupling interfaces to implementations.\n&gt;\n&gt; If Windows developers insist on tightly coupling their services to their\n&gt; object interfaces, then Unix developers will continue to code circles\n&gt; around them.\n\nYou misunderstand my point, methinks.\n\nI was referring to the simplicity of use, not the model. I agree that\ntightly coupled interfaces are bad and that is part of the reason why\nI prefer REST to WS-*. I am simply trying to make the point hat so\nlong as it takes a few minutes to bind to a WS-* endpoint, but there\nis nothing similar to bind to a REST endpoint, we will find it hard to\nwin jobbing developers to our cause.\n\nAlan Dean\n\n"}}
