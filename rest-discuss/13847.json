Too much detail=\r\n and exposure.\n\nIf instead, your resource is an order processing service, y=\r\nou can just post business documents and the database complexities are hidde=\r\nn. This possibility is very often (if not always) overlooked.\nBTW, OASIS bi=\r\nzz docs are good in the way of they being standards, still sometimes they a=\r\nre too complex for little things.
