I view the application as distributed across both the \n&gt; client and the\n&gt; server. \n\nThat&#39;s a reasonable scope.  In that case I don&#39;t think the &quot;engine&quot;\nanalogy is quite so clear, but I don&#39;t know that it is invalid\neither.  Does the server change state other than when a link is\nfollowed?  Certainly, but probably mostly outside the scope of web\narchitecture, like at startup or reconfig time.\n\nI think if you overanalyze the language, you come to the dry\nrealization that following pointers is how applications change state,\nand that URIs are pointers.  It doesn&#39;t mean we have to abandon\nNeutonean physics just yet.\n\n&gt; Using a GET only provides information to the client \n&gt; (in terms of\n&gt; side-effects) - and the client can decide what to do with it.\n\nI don&#39;t understand this.  Don&#39;t we agree that GET is free of\nside-effects?\n\n&gt; How does this translate into transitioning into a new state for the\n&gt; application?\n\nWell, one of the things that characterizes states in a finite\nstate machine is the list of eligible states reachable from where\nyou are now.  In a well-designed web application, hyperlinks\ncorrespond pretty well to that list, don&#39;t they?  And it&#39;s not\nonly about GET.  If I am looking at a recently gotten User document and it\nhas\na link associated with the text &quot;close this user&quot;, and I POST\nthe right stuff to that URL, I just transitioned to a new client\nstate.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Color me still confused...\n&gt; \n\nTruly confused, or just pretending a little?\n\nWalden\n\n"}}
