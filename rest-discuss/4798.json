I want users to be able \nto interact with the application using their browsers (representations \nin HTML) or programmatically (representations in XML).\n\nI&#39;d like the interaction &quot;pattern&quot; to be similar for both types of \naccess. (Or maybe that&#39;s not something I should want?)\n\nThe application has a unique URL for each item it exposes to its users. \nUsing a browser, users can GET a URL and see a representation of the \nitem. If they want to edit the item, they click the &quot;Edit&quot; button which \nwould POST back to the same URL. After modifying the values, they click \nthe &quot;Submit&quot; button which POST-s back to the same URL again.\n\nSomething seems fishy with this design when compared with how it would \nbe done programmatically. A user would GET the URL and receive XML. They \nwould then PUT the modified XML to the same URL which would update the item.\n\nBrowsers don&#39;t support PUT-ing XML, of course. So we have to POST \nmultipart/form-data. I don&#39;t have a problem with implementing code that \ncan extract the necessary bits from XML or multipart/form-data.\n\nIt&#39;s the intermediate step of POST-ing to the URL to get an editable \nHTML representation of the item that I&#39;m not happy with.\n\nAn alternative would be to include a link with a query string parameter \nlike &quot;?mode=edit&quot; but that doesn&#39;t strike me as being very REST-ful, either.\n\nI know it&#39;s possible, but I&#39;m trying to avoid returning HTML containing \nthe necessary JavaScript to dynamically transform the initial \nrepresentation into an editable HTML form at the click of a button \n(without making another request).\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n-- Jason\n\n\n\n\n"}}
