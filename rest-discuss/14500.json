The client s=\r\nhould understand the rel value within the context of the representation it&#39;=\r\ns found in. This may come from a media type, maybe a protocol, or a registr=\r\ny of link relations. But the client does need to know about them.\n\n&gt; If yes=\r\n, hateoas seems not feasible since the client needs a previous\n&gt; knowledge =\r\nabout what to look for in the list of links... (unless there\n&gt; is only one =\r\nlink, of course)\n\nI&#39;d disagree here. HATEAOS is still quite feasible, but t=\r\nhe client needs to know the processing model for the media types it&#39;s deali=\r\nng with - they&#39;re a key part of a service&#39;s contract.\n\n&gt; the question is: c=\r\nan I create my own relation semantics ? or should I\n&gt; grasp in the availabl=\r\ne ones for Atom and Xhtml in case I want to\n&gt; produce HATEOAS systems?\n\nYou=\r\n can create your own semantics; you can create your own media types too. Th=\r\ne trade off is one of reach (that is, reusing existing software out there o=\r\nn the Web) versus applicability (you can craft something that matches your =\r\ndomain exactly).\n\nFWIW I generally prefer to try to solve problems with exi=\r\nsting media types before resorting to custom media types.\n\n&gt; * I am trying =\r\nto implement HATEOAS using Jersey.. I know it has no\n&gt; support out of the b=\r\nox, so I am designing some tricks here :)\n\nShameless plug: Chapter 5 of the=\r\n book Ian, Savas, and I are writing actually has examples of a hypermedia s=\r\nystem written with Jersey.\n\nJim\n"}}
