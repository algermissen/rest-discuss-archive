I definitely agree with you and do think that\nit&#39;s a big problem - REST is being misused as a marketing term and as\na substitute term for HTTP. I myself am closer to thinking that this\nproblem is currently unsolvable and this makes the effort to sort out\nthe &quot;mess&quot; less attractive (since it would probably not have as big an\nimpact).\n\nSo, just to pick your brain a bit more, let&#39;s say/pretend that we\ndon&#39;t want to solve that problem but rather sort out the problems\ntargeting people that do have an understanding of REST beyond that\nbuzzword level. What other problems do you see, would that be a\nworthwhile effort and what would it take to make it happen? I saw the\nother thread on &quot;REST clients&quot; which Eric started -- that&#39;s exactly\nwhat I&#39;m talking about.\n\nIn other words, there might be multiple problems caused by the whole\nmess, some of which might be worth solving and some not. So I&#39;m just\ninterested in seeing if there is a problem worth solving by asking\nwhat people would be interested in contributing to.\n\nThanks,\nIvan\n\nOn Tue, Apr 13, 2010 at 02:20, Will Hartung &lt;willh@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; On Sat, Apr 10, 2010 at 6:28 AM, Eric J.

How hard can it be.\n&gt;\n&gt; And off they go.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sending crap over HTTP == REST. Thankfully, REST is easier to\n&gt; pronounce than HTTP. So all my ad hoc HTTP RPC interfaces now become\n&gt; REST interfaces. Simple. Just rolls of the tounge.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, the problem is that REST is already understood, WELL understood.\n&gt; It just happens to be pretty much completely wrong.\n&gt;\n&gt; Then you have to go in to the whole thesis, the concepts behind it,\n&gt; the vocabulary, etc. etc. etc. &quot;Why can&#39;t I just POST whatever I\n&gt; want?&quot; arguments, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s hardly worth fighting any more. It&#39;s exhausting. If folks want to\n&gt; know about REST, they can look it up.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you think that REST is misunderstood, then rewrite the wikipedia\n&gt; article until it&#39;s clear, so that rather than getting in to exhausting\n&gt; discussions, advocates can just point to that and the thesis and tell\n&gt; folks to come back later if they&#39;re interested. They won&#39;t, HTTP RPC\n&gt; solves 99% of the use cases that they&#39;re REALLY trying to solve, so\n&gt; they won&#39;t make the leap to rearchitecting their system. But at least\n&gt; it makes it easier for folks using it to make the material more\n&gt; approachable.\n&gt;\n\n"}}
