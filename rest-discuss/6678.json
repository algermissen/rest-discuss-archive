It is currently the &quot;paste after&quot; operation,\n&gt; as\n&gt; &gt; compared to PUT&#39;s &quot;paste over&quot;. The changed definition just means\n&gt; &gt; &quot;tunnel arbitrary stuff&quot;. As such, this changed definition of POST\n&gt; &gt; introduces non-self-descriptive messages into the core HTTP.\n&gt; POST(p) isn&#39;t tunneling, and its use is fully self-descriptive AFAICT.\n&gt; It&#39;s operational semantics are just that the client has no visibility\n&gt; into what the server might do with the provided representation (other\n&gt; than &quot;process it&quot;). Tunneling - let&#39;s call it POST(t) - isn&#39;t\n&gt; self-descriptive because the effective operation isn&#39;t POST, it&#39;s\n&gt; getStockQuote or whatever.\n\nI&#39;m not sure what your definition of POST(p) is, here... or what you\nmean by POST(a) below.\n\nMy summary of the common methods is as follows:\nGET transfers the state demarcated by a particular resource to a client\nPUT transfers state to replace that demarcated by a particular resource\nPOST transfers additional state to be included in the set demarcated by\na particular resource\nDELETE transfers the null state to replace the set demarcated by a\nparticular resource\n\nAll client-&gt;server state transfer operations may impact other resources.\nResources may be created, destroyed, or changed. PUT and POST can\nindicate direct creation semantics \n\nREST says that methods should be standard. We should have a common\nunderstanding of what these methods do. Having a standard identifier\nscheme and standard methods brings us one step closer to solving the\nsocial problem of inter-agency communication (communication between\ncompeting interests). The methods should be general enough to\nencapsulate all forms of information transfer between client and server,\nbut specific enough to derive useful semantics from to do things like\nperforming access control. There should be no confusion when describing\nwhat POST does to a new RESTafarian.\n\nI believe my take on POST is both general and specific enough to be\nuseful.\n\n&gt; &gt; In practice POST is usually used in this way. As such, the errata\n&gt; itself\n&gt; &gt; makes a fair degree of sense. However, I see it as a step backwards\n&gt; as\n&gt; &gt; far as REST is concerned.\n&gt; POST(p) is still uniform. If you want POST(a), you&#39;ll need a new\n&gt; method name ... or a new protocol - perhaps Waka will have a POST(a)\n&gt; equivalent?\n\nI believe that my summary of POST is consistent with the HTTP\nspecification. I would like to see a clear summary of any alternative\ninterpretation of POST before commenting further. I am wary of any\ndefinition that permits the tunnelling of arbitrary methods. The changed\ndefinition referred to in this thead&#39;s original post says:\n\n&quot;The actual function performed by the POST method is determined by the\nserver and is usually dependent on the Request-URI.&quot;\n\nThat reads to me as &quot;we had better make sure that using POST for\ntransferring SOAP requests is clearly permitted by the standard&quot;. As I\nindicated in my earlier post, I think that kind of languge is pratical\nas far as current practice goes but is a step backwards for REST.\n\nBenjamin.\n\n\n\n"}}
