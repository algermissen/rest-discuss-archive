Maybe cookies pass arbitrary information from origin\n&gt; &gt; se=\r\nrver to user agent and back. If that is so, then the use of\n&gt; &gt; cookies sti=\r\nll violates the constraint of self-descriptive\n&gt; &gt; messages, because cookie=\r\ns are not self-descriptive at all.\n\nAristotle Pagaltzis responded (in\n&lt;http=\r\n://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/10925&gt;):\n\n&gt; So cookies =\r\nviolate they constraint because they violate the\n&gt; constraint? You have beg=\r\nged the question but not actually given\n&gt; any reason for your claim.\n\nIf co=\r\nokies are vehicles for passing arbitrary information, as you tell\nme that t=\r\nhey are, then it is the arbitrary nature that prevents\nself-description. Us=\r\ner agents and intermediaries are unable to determine\nwhether a cookie carri=\r\nes authentication credentials, a reference to\nsession state, a directive to=\r\n override the method, or something else. In\nterms of desirable properties, =\r\nthe effect is to reduce visibility, thus\nreducing cacheability, thus reduci=\r\nng network performance.\n\nI truly struggle to explain my point because, to m=\r\ne, it seems extremely\nobvious. Yeah, if an application fails to conform to =\r\na constraint, then\nit has violated the constraint. I don&#39;t see self-descrip=\r\ntiveness as a\ndefault for data. On the contrary, I see that it takes nontri=\r\nvial effort\non the part of designers to craft self-descriptive data. If you=\r\n agree\nthat self-descriptiveness is not a default for data, then the onus i=\r\ns on\nthe people who find cookies in harmony with REST to show how cookies a=\r\nre\nself-descriptive. If you disagree and posit that self-descriptiveness is=\r\n\nthe default for data, then I would ask that you provide some evidence\nfor =\r\nyour claim.\n\n-- \n(I&#39;m trying to be open-minded and friendly and to presume =\r\nthat others\nare doing the same. I think that my writing failed to convey my=\r\n attempt,\nbut please know that I come to the table in good faith.) \n\nPlease=\r\n do not reply to me when replying to rest-discuss. I read the\nmessages that=\r\n people send to rest-discuss and I do not want duplicates.\n\n\n"}}
