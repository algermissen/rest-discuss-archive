To  \n&gt; create a new process instance you POST to the process container and  \n&gt; get back the URI of the instance. A GET on that URI will provide you  \n&gt; with some hypermedia that tells you what state transitions are  \n&gt; possible from the current state of the process. Depending on who does  \n&gt; the GET the application can present different sets of possible  \n&gt; transitions. That way the application (the process instance) serves  \n&gt; as a coordinator for the various process participants.\n\nWell that&#39;s true. But the point I was trying to get to is that\n&quot;orchestration&quot; is a bit like macro programming. It is high level and\ntherefore it&#39;s supposed to be simple but that&#39;s a misconception.\n\nBut it&#39;s not about building a new REST service in the same way we\nbuild the current ones (though it would be *really* interesting if you\ncould genericisize it like that) but about a method of mashing up\nexisting REST services with an extra bit of logic in some manager\nfriendly way.\n\nI think it would be possible to come up with nice, gui tools to do\nthis. And I think it would be easier to do it with REST based ws than\nWS-* based ws (where amusingly they have to invent even more protocols\nand data formats!)\n\n\n&gt; When you do a purchase at Amazon, you do not memorize the transitions  \n&gt; you did once and do the same transitions every time; you start from  \n&gt; the beginning each time and let the application take you through the  \n&gt; state machine. If it changes from one purchase to the next (e.g. they  \n&gt; might bring in an extra click-here-to-get-a-discount step), you will  \n&gt; still be able to carry out your purchase as desired.\n&gt;\n&gt; This form of loose coupling is simply impossible if the client has to  \n&gt; know (aka hard-coded) the call sequence of the API methods.\n\nThat&#39;s a really good point.\n\n\nBut it does lack pirate jokes.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
