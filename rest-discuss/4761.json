When you \nuse RDF, you enter the wonderful world of partial understanding: \nAlthough a user agent or intermediary might not understand *all* RDF \nschemas used in an RDF message, it can still use the statements that it \n*does* understand.\n\n\n&gt;&gt;That is: how can a script as the one above decide how to step through \n&gt;&gt;the application at runtime (by traversing links) without knowing \n&gt;&gt;everything about the involved steps up-front.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    that&#39;s the part I&#39;m still missing -- if I talk to an &quot;address&quot; resource \n&gt;and an &quot;order&quot; resource..when I get behind the scenes -- all that\n&gt;data has to verified and linked back together.  (when I submit an \n&gt;order -- how does my order resource know that the \n&gt;address-resources I submitted are valid?) \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nWhat do you mean by &#39;valid&#39; here? Valid in terms of a DTD/schema?\n\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;an RPC style approach, the components would not be able\n&gt;&gt;to *talk* to each other at all,\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   I&#39;m not sure I would say that -- \n&gt;\n&gt;you may need to say that developers\n&gt;would need to understand the RPC API&#39;s for the given protocol, and build\n&gt;it into a client...X11, nettrek, doom, and probably even the P2P clients \n&gt;all demonstrate you can build traditional client-server applications using \n&gt;RPC.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYes, but you have to *know* *all* the APIs up front, otherwise you \ncannot build the apps. OTH, if you use a uniform API, your apps can \nallways communicate  (e.g. to negotiate  a  representation type they \nboth understand  -  see HTTP content negitiation).\n\n&gt;   just because you&#39;re communicating in plain-text.. \n&gt;\nBut REST is not about communicating in plain text (text/plain?) it is \nabout making the message type explicit (Content-Type HTTP header).\n\n&gt;your resources still\n&gt;need to know that a specific tag is refering to the zip-code ( which will make\n&gt;interacting with differenent resources more challenging. )\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nChallanging - sure, but if I use RDF and use a \nstandardized/well-known/company-wide schema for the ZIP property, \nall/most of the apps can at least see it is a ZIP, even if they do not \nunderstand the rest of the message. To me this is a whole lot better \nthan not being able to engage in a conversation at all because the RPC \nAPIs are not equal, e.g. getStockQuote(&quot;IBM&quot;) vs getStockQuoteIBM().\n\n\n &gt; but I digress... I like the idea of distributed resources...I&#39;m even \nOK with\n\n&gt;building a better client to make it happen...but I wanted to make sure I&#39;m \n&gt;not completely out in left field.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nMake sure you look at Mark Baker&#39;s work regarding RDFForms and Resource \nState:\n\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca/2001/09/draft-baker-http-resource-state-model-01.txt\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca/2003/05/RDF-Forms/\n\nJan\n\n&gt;       --erik  \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
