I don&#39;t think there is consensus at all, even on this \n&gt; list of REST proponents. I, for one, disagree very strongly with many \n&gt; of the things said about HATEOAS on this list.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s about buzzwords at all. I&#39;d love to be able to say \n&gt; &quot;Let&#39;s take a RESTful approach here.&quot; in a room of random developers \n&gt; that I might be working with and have them all understand what I \n&gt; meant. We are not there now -- REST means different things to \n&gt; different people and HATEOAS is the main area where opinions and \n&gt; understanding differ.\n&gt;\n&gt; Roy has said many times that his thesis didn&#39;t go into enough detail \n&gt; on HATEOAS and RESTful hypermedia design. There is a void in REST \n&gt; literature that needs filling IMHO.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2009/6/5 Ant�nio Mota &lt;amsmota@... &lt;mailto:amsmota@...&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     &quot;Hypermedia describes protocols&quot;, &quot;Hypermedia constrains\n&gt;     protocols&quot;, are these really attempts to explain the &quot;hipermedia\n&gt;     constraint&quot; in Rest, or are attempts to create buzzwords with\n&gt;     marketing value?\n&gt;\n&gt;     I mean, I think buzzwords can be a good thing in spreading\n&gt;     technologies (like it was the case with AJAX), but I don&#39;t think\n&gt;     there&#39;s a value in these kind of expressions to explain what&#39;s\n&gt;     explained by the author itself, on the contrary it only adds to\n&gt;     the confusion.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     wahbedahbe wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;         For what it&#39;s worth, I think &quot;Hypermedia constrains protocols&quot;\n&gt;         would be better. If you think about it, a browser speaks a\n&gt;         general protocol defined by HTTP + media formats + the full\n&gt;         URI space. Hypermedia puts constraints on the URI space and\n&gt;         the HTTP methods that can be used on the URIs. It also puts\n&gt;         constraints on the media formats for data that can be sent in\n&gt;         a request using forms e.g. instead of just any old\n&gt;         form-url-encoded data, it has to be something with the format:\n&gt;         foo=&lt;foo_val&gt;&bar=&lt;bar_val&gt; because foo and bar are inputs in\n&gt;         the form.\n&gt;\n&gt;         Hypermedia is constraining the general protocol at each state\n&gt;         in the client&#39;s execution rather than defining some entirely\n&gt;         new protocol.\n&gt;\n&gt;         Just my 2 cents...\n&gt;\n&gt;         Andrew Wahbe\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
