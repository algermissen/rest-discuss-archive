Along these lines, GNU\nLinux is a R=\r\nEST toolkit and Bash/Vi are client tools. Now if you agree\nwith that, it&#39;s =\r\nfine and we can stop there: what we call things is\nlargely a mater of taste=\r\n in any case. Personally, I like my definitions\nto define things not blur t=\r\nhem together. There&#39;s a difference between\nsaying you can use J2EE to do RE=\r\nStful stuff and saying that it is for\nRESTful stuff. I&#39;m sure you know this=\r\n, so I&#39;m wondering where you&#39;re\ncoming from. \n\n\n&gt; REST is the architecture =\r\nof the Web \n \nI know.\n\n&gt; and a REST toolkit would be a piece of software th=\r\nat helps \n&gt; you build the mediating layer between your application and \n&gt; t=\r\nhe Web. AFAIK, that&#39;s what (e.g.) J2EE and Zope are used \n&gt; for. \n\nJ2EE was=\r\n not designed to do that any more than CORBA and DCOM were. That\nthey&#39;re be=\r\ning refactoring to do this class of work or even that you can\nuse J2EE for =\r\nthat class of work is incidental; that&#39;s aside from the\nfact that J2EE syst=\r\nem encompasses more than a pair of EJB and Servlets\ncontainers.\n\nBill de h=\r\n=D3ra\n\n..\nPropylon\nwww.propylon.com \n\n \n\n\n"}}
