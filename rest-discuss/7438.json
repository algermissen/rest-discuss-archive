Thoroughly specified\n&gt; &gt;  schemas describing almost every possible Purchase Order Request and\n&gt; &gt;  Response. Guess how long it takes one large computer manufacturer to\n&gt; &gt;  shake out enough impedance mismatches to get going with each new\n&gt; &gt;  trading partner? 30-60 days, and that is a dedicated team of experts\n&gt; &gt;  exchanging test messages, &quot;validating&quot; them, discovering and resolving\n&gt; &gt;  the semantic mismatches in even the &quot;valid&quot; documents. So that&#39;s one\n&gt; &gt;  or two months per partner. How long does it take to ramp on just 100\n&gt; &gt;  partners? Years. Not  web scale, is it?\n&gt;\n&gt; That fits with my experience.  Previous ecommerce standards, ANSI X12\n&gt; EDI and EDIFACT, were even worse: took months.\n&gt;\n&gt; Some of the same people have now created UBL: a 4th or 5th generation\n&gt; (X12, EDIFACT, RosettaNet, UBL, depending on whether you put ebXML\n&gt; into that geneology).  We&#39;ll see how quickly new trading partners can\n&gt; get going using that.  I think it&#39;s less prescriptive than RosettaNet,\n&gt; which tried to achieve minimal configuration.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\nIt would be good to experiment with a forms style using UBL. I think\nyou could construct forms using UBL components, so that Toshiba could\nhave their own PO and Hitachi could have another. Purchasing software\nwould then be able to GET the forms, and complete them, POSTing the\nright information in the PO, because the clients know the definitions\nin UBL.\n\nHugh\n\n"}}
