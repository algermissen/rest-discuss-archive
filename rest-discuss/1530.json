Then see how many actions you minimally need to get the job\ndone.\n\nLets list these many other actions, show the two approaches and see what\neverybody thinks.\n\n&gt; Few people really thinking of turning on the air\n&gt; conditioning as changing the state of the AC into the &quot;ON&quot; state.\nBut what about software systems? How are they best described?\n\n&gt; Starting a race is an action that isn&#39;t naturally modeled as a &quot;noun&quot;.\nThe state of a race is information that isn&#39;t naturally modelled as an\n&#39;action&#39;.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I definitely agree that having a record created of an action as a\n&gt; consequence is often useful, but doesn&#39;t necessarily make that the natural\n&gt; mental model for programmers or ultimately, end-users.\nTrue - but REST isn&#39;t about procedural programming or end-users mental\nmodels, it is about large scale networked systems.\nRDBMS and SQL isn&#39;t all that natural for programmers and don&#39;t even try to\nexplain it to end-users, but they still have some value.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
