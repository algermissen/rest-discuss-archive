If you moved the cookie info to a\n&gt; URI-accessible location, then it would be RESTful. A big issue with\n&gt; current practice (not with HTTP or REST) is that usually clients don&#39;t\n&gt; have HTTP servers running in them or on their behalf so the server\n&gt; can&#39;t get at client-side state with a simple GET. (c.f. the\n&gt; &quot;client-side shopping basket&quot; statement above). This asymmetry also\n&gt; impacts the ability to do decent asynchronous callbacks from the\n&gt; server to the client.\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;ve been struggling with authentication/authorization and how to fit it \ninto the REST model...\n\nI&#39;m probably confusing several issues (and I&#39;m probably unaware of others), \nbut it seems very difficult to provide authentication and authorization \nwithout cookies or some similar mechanism - and I&#39;m not sure I see a \nsolution that doesn&#39;t just shift the problem (state-hiding) somewhere else.\n\nIn all the examples I&#39;ve seen, the resources are assumed to be publicly \naccessible.  In the example above, the suggestion is to move the hidden \nstate stored in a cookie to a URI-accessible location.  However, once I&#39;ve \ndone that, I would think that I am then obliged to ensure that only the user \nwho owns that information is able to retrieve it.  How do I do that if I \ncant also issue the user a token (cookie) that they can then use as proof of \nidentity?\n\nMy first thoughts were that you could use HTTPS with client certs to provide \nidentity, but it seems that you&#39;ve only shifted the problem around.  Instead \nof providing proof of identity with a cookie, your providing it with a \ncertificate.  Or maybe using a cookie for authentication doesnt violate the \nno-hidden-state rule.\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n"}}
