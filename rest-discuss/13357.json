I can&#39;t see \n&gt; why we would want or need a &quot;REST standard&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; For analogy; OO people get by fine without having an OO standard - \n&gt; there are plenty of standards for things which use or enable OO, but \n&gt; not for OO itself.\n&gt;\nWell, in the &quot;other&quot; discussion I said about the standards that\n\n&gt; I think the way to try to standardize something will be to start at \n&gt; the grass-roots, with what people trying to understand and apply REST \n&gt; could deal with, and go from there up. And these things are clearly, \n&gt; imo, patterns and best-practices. \nSo I don&#39;t think a Body is needed for that, but if eventually such a \ncommunity around &quot;patterns and best-practices&quot; would decide to create \none (after a critical mass of patterns and best-practices were defined) \nI don&#39;t think that will bring evil to the world...\n\n"}}
