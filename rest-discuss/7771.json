It&#39;s perfectly okay to \nmap it as a redirect from a GET - that entities returned from resources \nchange over time is one of the inherent features of REST and this can \njust as easily be between every single request as it can over more \nclearly marked times of modification.\n\nHence a 307 Temporary Redirect from the &quot;dice&quot; resource would be \napposite. Note that by default 307 responses are not cacheable (which \nsuits your purposes) though there is nothing to stop the target of the \nredirect being cached (which is a good thing, if chance does mean a \nrepeat on the dice there&#39;s no reason why the cache shouldn&#39;t be used).\n\nIf you need to guard against cheating then a different model would be \nrequired beyond a purely simple 307.\n\n\n"}}
