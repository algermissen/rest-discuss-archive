The good thing about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doing that is that an intermediary would know that /search has changed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; state due to the POST, whereas if it went to /add, the state change\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would be transparent and the intermediary wouldn&#39;t know.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; hmm. Individual searches are separate resources; i.e., they have\n&gt; &gt; different query strings, so this wouldn&#39;t necessarily work, no? (It\n&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t make sense to POST a query, obviously).\n&gt; \n&gt; Why not?  Don&#39;t think of the resource as being a search, but think of\n&gt; it as the result of a search.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=foo&quot; is the set of all resources known\n&gt; by Google to contain the word &quot;foo&quot;.  That it requires a search to\n&gt; resolve this URI at google.com is immaterial really.\n&gt; \n&gt; So there&#39;s no problem with POSTing to /search.  That would be one way\n&gt; for Google to allow people to register new unindexed resources, for\n&gt; example.  But as mentioned below, the name is confusing.\n\nWell, there&#39;s no problem POSTing an update to /search (or whatever),\nbut doing a query through POST doesn&#39;t seem very RESTy at all.\n\nSo, to review (and make sure I&#39;ve got a cohesive interface), \n\nhttp://www.example.org/addresses \n   Exposes the DB as a whole\n   GET: representation is the main interface (queries, etc.)\n   POST: add a new entry, returns a 303 to the created resource\nhttp://www.example.org/addresses?repr=add\n   GET: representation is an add form\nhttp://www.example.org/addresses?query_to_the_db\n   GET: representation is a listing of the query\nhttp://www.example.org/addresses/thePerson\n   exposes a particular record\n   GET: representation is a person&#39;s record\n   POST: update the resource/record, returns a 303 to the resource\n   PUT: create the resource/record (multiple content-types\n        supported?), returns a status page (or a 303?)\n   DELETE: delete the resource/record, returns a status page\nhttp://www.example.org/addresses/thePerson?repr=edit\n   GET: representation is an edit form\n\nThese duplicate functionality above:\n\nhttp://www.example.org/addresses/thePerson?method=PUT\n   POST: tunnels to PUT, returns a status page\nhttp://www.example.org/addresses/thePerson?method=DELETE\n   POST: tunnels to DELETE, returns a status page\n\n\nI&#39;m a *little* uncomfortable with the ?repr=add, but I can&#39;t say\nexactly why.\n\n\n&gt; Exactly right.  An alternative is to tunnel PUT and DELETE through\n&gt; POST with a hidden form field called &quot;method&quot;.  At least the URI\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t change.  I guess there&#39;s a number of ways to kludge it.\n&gt; That would make for a good RESTwiki page.\n\nThat would be cool. I like the method= kludge...\n\n\n&gt; http://internet.conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/HowWikiComparesToRest\n\nAh, I&#39;d seen that, but never investigated.
