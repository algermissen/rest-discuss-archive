False. If using WSDL As It Should, =\r\nyou may end up with a dynamic client. Implementations now are static, compi=\r\nle time, which gives you what you mention. But the same fate is destined fo=\r\nr REST if client does not follow HATEOAS. HATEOAS is not only using links, =\r\nbut have a way to follow in a dynamic way. Most of clients now have some or=\r\n all of the links wired in the code.\n\n2. False. SOAP nor Web Services do no=\r\nt hide in any way the resourced ID. Actually, a web service is a resource w=\r\nith an ID.\n\nWe may be careful not to confuse the business semantics with th=\r\ne transport and envelop semantics.\n\nWilliam Martinez Pomares\n\n--- In rest-d=\r\niscuss@yahoogroups.com, J=F8rn Wildt &lt;jw@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n\n&gt; Oh, well, there c=\r\nertainly are some benfits in REST that you don&#39;t get in \n&gt; SOAP:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Hy=\r\npermedia\n&gt; In SOAP you need to agree and all possible URLs and you cannot c=\r\nhange them \n&gt; afterwards. In REST you can require your client to follow lin=\r\nks instead of \n&gt; assuming URLs.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) Identifiable resources\n&gt; Have you e=\r\nver tried to mail a link to a SOAP service saying, &quot;hey, look at \n&gt; this co=\r\nol thing&quot;? You can do that in REST, not in SOAP.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) Standard ways of c=\r\naching/scaling\n&gt; \n&gt; ...  and, hmmm, well, all the other good stuff in Roy&#39;s=\r\n thesis ;-)\n&gt; \n&gt; /J=F8rn\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
