The design I have come\nup with is incredibly simple, flexible, and (i believe) even RESTful (no,\nreally!).  However, before I get too deep into its design, I thought I would\nlook around at what others are doing.  Anyone know of any RESTful (from the\nground up, preferably) &quot;mail&quot; systems out there already?\n\n\nIn the end, my objective is to get a simple, easily visible RESTful\napplication on the web and used by lots of people (the latter part is\npossibly more important that the former part).  As I have been reading the\n&quot;visibility&quot; thread, I got to thinking that (other than letting people\ndiscover for themselves the pitfalls of RPC) people would be more receptive\nto REST if they could actually see something RESTful.  I know the Web itself\nis RESTful, but it&#39;s hard to convince someone of the legitimacy of a term\nthat came after the application that demonstrated it.  Coming up with\nsomething *new* would, imho, be an easier thing to digest and understand to\nthe REST skeptics out there.\n\n\nTo that end, if anyone is interested in working with me on this, I will\nhappily share my thoughts.  I think it&#39;s highly workable, and would\ncertainly be more successful if it were a group effort.\n\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
