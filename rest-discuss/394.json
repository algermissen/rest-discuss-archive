First, there is no requirement for a\nfull HTTP server. So even if your statement is literally true, I don&#39;t\nthink it is applicable. An event handerl only has to accept POSTs to\npre-ordained URIs in a pre-ordained format with simple, pre-ordained\nsemantics. They won&#39;t generally be running CGIs which is where most HTTP\nserver exploits come from.\n\nSecond, any piece of software that contains an HTTP client without\nsecurity flaws can easily contain a mini-HTTP server component with the\nsame characteristic. Most of the code is the same....parsing MIME\nheaders, parsing MIME bodies etc. Most of the vulnerabilities are the\nsame. I don&#39;t see how moving the body retrieval to the GET makes much\ndifference. Yes a little, the code for GET may already exist and be\ntested. But most of it is the same.\n\nWhat vulnerabilities do I see?\n\n * Callback scanning is worth considering The &quot;port space&quot; is relatively\nsmall. But to find an HTTP server hiding out on a particular URI you\nneed the IP address, the port number, *and* the correct URI, which could\nhave a long secret code in it. So I would say that we could change the\nspec to allow the HTTP server to ignore requests to non-existent URIs to\nmake hiding out easier. This will make it practically impossible to use\na brute-force scanning technique to find a callback. You&#39;ll have to\nsearch every possible URI on every port on each IP address.\n\n * Spoofing and man-in-the-middle is another thing worth consideing. I\nthink that only crypto can prevent this. But there is a price for crypto\nso it should be optional. This can be done either in the application\nlayer (signing payloads) or the socket layer (SSL).\n\nUnless we can agree on the security problem we&#39;re trying to solve, I\ndon&#39;t think we&#39;ll see eye to eye on the solution. So I&#39;ll leave it there\nbefore getting back into the details of your proposed solution. If you\nsee the vulnerabilities above differently than I do, or want to list\nothers, please do.\n\nOne more issue:\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; Sorry, you need to explain what you mean by unidirectional.  You mean that a\n&gt; client which wishes to receive events must connect to a presence server a la\n&gt; KnowNow?  That is a non-starter.  No chance.  The resources are right there on\n&gt; the client.  You mean that if the accounting web server wants to send an event\n&gt; to Joe the Accountant in the next cube they have to rendezvous at the KN router\n&gt; in California?\n\nWell if they are within a zone of trust, then they might accept\nconnections from each other directly.\n\nAnd if they were on opposite side of one or more firewalls then yes,\nthey would probably each contact a rendezvous machine.\n\nThat&#39;s how IRC works. And how MSN, POP, and netnews. All of these\nrequire an intermediary. But unlike IRC or MSN or POP, we will preserve\nthe ability for end-user nodes to connect directly if the hosts trust\neach other.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
