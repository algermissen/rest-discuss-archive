It seems to me that part of what makes REST effective is\n&gt; that, given a particular RESTful system, we can all agree on what does and\n&gt; does not constitute the representation of a resource (either sent or\n&gt; received, for that matter).  However, with HTTP this is not very clear to\n&gt; me.  I would think that the Message-body is always part of the\n&gt; representation (when there is one).  But the headers seems to be less\n&gt; well-defined.  For instance, would the &quot;Location&quot; header in a 201 response\n&gt; be considered part of the representation?  As you suggest, Content-Type\n&gt; would be about the respresentation.  Does that mean that it is not part of\n&gt; the representation?\nYes - I believe it is not &#39;part&#39; of the representation. I see a graph of\nrelated nodes - the graph is the interesting information, one node is the\n&#39;representation&#39;. The graph says a lot about the representation - like what\nthe syntax is, what the meaning is, what the encryption is, etc. Even if you\nview metadata as &#39;part&#39; of the data - there are metadata items about that\nare purely about the request or response (success/failure, caching, etc.)\nthat are still very useful in dealing with the representation.\n\n&gt;\n\n"}}
