Not a violation of the spec -- more just &quot;disregard&quot; f=\r\nor the spec.  So &quot;SHOULD&quot; is to be treated as: &quot;you really ought to unless =\r\nyou really know what you are doing and you have a good, valid reason not to=\r\n&quot;, not &quot;this is a good idea that you might want to consider&quot;. I find that m=\r\nost folks seem to be omitting a body in 201 responses for no reason other t=\r\nhan they don&#39;t want to be bothered -- they are treating POST as being exemp=\r\nt to HATEOAS, not even using the location header to redirect or anything li=\r\nke that. It&#39;s just RPC with the procedure call returning a URI that happens=\r\n to be in the  location header. Pet peeve of mine...\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyways, I&#39;ve fin=\r\nd the use of &quot;Location&quot; in 201 and 3xx to be a bit strange. On the one hand=\r\n, you&#39;d think that the intent of using it in 201 is to redirect the client =\r\nto the new resource while indicating that a new resource has been created. =\r\nBut I&#39;ve never been able to find a definitive statement on whether 201 shou=\r\nld result in a redirect. The only text that comes close is in the text desc=\r\nribing the location header itself:\n&gt;    The Location response-header field =\r\nis used to redirect the recipient\n&gt;    to a location other than the Request=\r\n-URI for completion of the\n&gt;    request or identification of a new resource=\r\n. For 201 (Created)\n&gt; \n&gt;    responses, the Location is that of the new reso=\r\nurce which was created\n&gt; \n&gt;    by the request. For 3xx responses, the locat=\r\nion SHOULD indicate the\n&gt;    server&#39;s preferred URI for automatic redirecti=\r\non to the resource.\n&gt; It&#39;s not clear to me if the use of the word &#39;redirect=\r\n&#39; in the first sentence means an automatic request here or not -- you&#39;d thi=\r\nnk it would be more explicit in the description of 201 if it was. I read it=\r\n as to be used for automatic redirection in the 3xx case and identification=\r\n of the new resource in the 201 case. And AFAIK, no widely-used HTTP client=\r\ns or browsers do auto-redirect on 201\n\nI found this: http://www.w3.org/Prot=\r\nocols/HTTP/1.1/rfc2616bis/issues/#i61 (which suggests that the original int=\r\nention was location of created resource OR redirect target).\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; So if =\r\nyou don&#39;t redirect then this leaves the client in either the steady state d=\r\nefined by the body or, if there was no body in the response, in the same st=\r\neady state it was in before the request (sort of like a 204 response).\n\nYes=\r\n. Interestingly, this means that the client&#39;s application state does not ch=\r\nange although it made a request. But what if the client has this current st=\r\nate:\n\nGET /book\n\n&lt;documentIndex&gt;\n  &lt;chapter href=3D&quot;chapter1.xml&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;chap=\r\nter href=3D&quot;chapter2.xml&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;appendix href=3D&quot;appendix1.xml&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;chapter=\r\ns href=3D&quot;chapters/&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/documentIndex&gt;\n\nand then it does\n\nDELETE /book/app=\r\nendix1.xml\n\n204 No Content\n\nThe client&#39;s state is now &#39;wrong&#39; in the sense =\r\nthat the third link should be removed. Since the server cannot know what st=\r\nate the client was in before the DELETE request, it cannot really assist by=\r\n sending the updated state.\n\nShould the client take care of &#39;adjusting&#39; the=\r\n state itself?\n\nOn the contrary, if you did\n\nPOST /book/chapters/\n\n&lt;newCpat=\r\ner&gt;\n\nthe server would usually say &quot;Hey, this has updated some resource, loo=\r\nk:&quot;\n\n303 See Other\nLocation: /book\n\n\n\nHmmm - so it is probably wise to do t=\r\nhis then:\n\nDELETE /book/appendix1.xml\n\n303 See Other\nLocation: /book\n\n\n\n\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; That&#39;s my take anyways -- would love to know if anyone had authoritative=\r\n info on if 201 was supposed to redirect (and the body was means as a &quot;back=\r\nup&quot; as in the 3xx case).\n\n\nSee link above.\n\nJan\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Andrew\n&gt; \n&gt; 2010/2/2 =\r\nAnt=F3nio Mota &lt;amsmota@...&gt;\n&gt; But SHOULD is not SHALL, is a recommen=\r\ndation not a imposition... So not having a body on a 201 could not be consi=\r\ndered a violation of the spec...
