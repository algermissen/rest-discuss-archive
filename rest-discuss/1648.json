I found the discussion starting at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/704 which ends up with Paul suggesting the following changes, among others:\n\n&quot;A notification message MAY have the following headers: \n\nWatched-URI: (URI of the watched resource) \n\nThe Watched-URI may be any valid URI for the resource that generated the\nnotification. It need not be the original URI but it must refer to the\nsame resource. If the client wants to retrieve a representation of the\nresource it SHOULD use this URI, not the original one. This will allow\npublishers to do a simple form of load balancing.&quot;\n\nWhat is the status of these changes and is the &#39;Subscription-URI: URI of the subscription object &#39;  the URI of the subscription resource returned as a &#39;Location&#39; header in the subscription response?\n\nRobert\n\n\n"}}
