That&#39;s a bit of a  \n&gt; slap, which might warrant a reference or two.\n\nEh?  I didn&#39;t say it was suppressed, nor did I say that deep analysis\nisn&#39;t present in OOD.  I meant that debates about which methodology\nto use for a given system have essentially disappeared, replaced\nwith so-called &quot;uniform&quot; methodologies that assume OOD.  The reason\nfor that is not technical at all -- the software industry changed,\nand analysts went with the money.  This is a very old topic in\nsoftware engineering.\n\n   &lt;http://www.google.com/search?q=software+engineering+fad&gt;\n\nand I am sure that some people will list REST among them too,\neventually.  Hopefully, some people will look beyond the fad aspect\nand start asking the right questions.\n\n   &lt;http://www-03.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/page/gradybooch? \nentry=snake_oil_oriented_architecture&gt;\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
