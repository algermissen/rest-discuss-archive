I have yet\n&gt; to create a media type, and object strongly to the notion that REST\n&gt; developers should mint new media types for every project.\n\nif you use RDFa, you introduce another vocabulary through the back door. \nthat&#39;s fine with me, i just want to point out that this is no different \nfrom using XML and application/xml as media type and then depend on \napplications understanding the schema being used by picking up hints \nsuch as DOCTYPE or namespaces or xsi:schemaLocation. if you have \nspecific application domain concepts that must be understood by clients \nto engage in meaningful interaction patterns, then there are only \nvariations of how to push this complexity somewhere. the magic of HTML \nis that the interaction semantics are application-agnostic, and the same \nis true for Atom, but for any application that cannot depend on an \nintelligent person driving the client through every single interaction, \nyou need more semantics to make things work.\n\npersonally (just like you, i think), i am in favor of using fewer media \ntypes and having vocabularies in there which must be understood by \nclients to continue their path, but i do have certain sympathy for the \nargument that exposing this vocabulary in a visible way on the protocol \nlevel has some advantages, too.\n\ncheers,\n\ndret,\n\n"}}
