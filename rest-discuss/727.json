HTTP\n&gt; allows you to do this either by POSTing to a document or PUTting to a\n&gt; URI provided by the server. So beyond being strongly typed, each URI\n&gt; must have associated with it a set of possible methods and inputs. Think\n&gt; of this as a 4-tuple:\n&gt;\n&gt;  * HTTP method\n&gt;  * query parameters\n&gt;  * HTTP headers\n&gt;  * body content (often XML in some vocabulary)\n&gt;\n\nJesus, this is scary.  I was thinking about this on the drive home today, in\nthe sense of abstract models for the Web.  I was coming from the direction of\nmodeling requests and responses directly ---  two kinds of tuples, one a\nrequest-type tuple and another a response-type tuple.  The request tuple Q is\n\n&lt; namespace, base-uri, query-uri, method, headers, body &gt;\n\nIt&#39;s important to capture namespace (aka the Host: header, elevated to\nfirst-class status due to its primary role in dispatching requests arriving\nat a given node) and the base-uri so that you can model the behavior of\nintermediaries and e.g. WD-Proxylike NOTIFY where the receipient is a\ndifferent Host: than the actual server, also important for virtual hosts,\netc.  A response tuple S is then something like\n\n&lt; response-code, headers, body &gt;\n\nA resource is then viewed as a function R:  Q --&gt; time --&gt; S, and a server\n(node) is viewed as a generic function N: Q --&gt; R.  (Sorry for the\nHaskell-like notation if it&#39;s confusing.  X --&gt; Y is a unary function that\nmaps X into Y,  X --&gt; Y --&gt; Z is a curry function that takes X into a\nfunction that takes Y into Z.  Perhaps more intuitively, it&#39;s a 2-ary\nfunction that takes X and Y into Z.)\n\nThe point of all of these contortions in my mental exercise was to arrive at\na concise way to specify the semantics of the Web in a manner that would\nenable dataflow-like composition --- or any sort of compositional algebra of\noperations on --- various Web resources, transformations, and so on.  The Web\nneeds a shell language, and this could be the start of its theoretical\nunderpinnings.\n\nAnyway, Paul, I think you&#39;re on an interesting track with this!\n\njb\n\n\n\n\n"}}
