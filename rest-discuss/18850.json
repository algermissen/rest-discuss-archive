The reason is that it seems\npractical to have a single =\r\nmedia-type for a representation I could use\nfor different user agent techno=\r\nlogies, such as a browser. I just feel\nthat something may be wrong by sendi=\r\nng atom feeds to my command line\nclient if I want a plain text representati=\r\non.\n\nI&#39;m thinking about defining a new media-type specialized for the shell=\r\n\nenvironment. Let&#39;s call it &quot;application/console&quot; for now. What I think\ncou=\r\nld be useful for the command line user agent is having hyper media\ncontrols=\r\n, for now just links and forms, separate from the text version\nof a represe=\r\nntation. Instead of having an interactive console, just as\nthe well known l=\r\nynx or links browsers command line tool, the shell\nprompt would return betw=\r\neen every request. That mean that you would\nhave access to your shell. Link=\r\ns for forms from the plain text\nrepresentation would be map to numbers and =\r\nthose numbers would be\nreset at every state transitions to reflect the new =\r\npossible state\ntransitions. It is kind of semi-interactive tool which I thi=\r\nnk is well\nsuited for command line work flow.\n\nLet&#39;s see a possible use cas=\r\ne.\nLet&#39;s call the tool &quot;foo&quot;\nThe lines beginning with # is what could happe=\r\nn under the hood.\n\n$ foo http://example.org\n# GET /\n# Accept: application/c=\r\nonsole\nHello, here is what you could do from here:\n[1]: Read the FAQ\n[2]: S=\r\nearch for documents\n\n$ foo 1\n# Get /faq\n# Accept: application/console\n[1]: =\r\nBack to homepage\nQ. two + two\nA. four\nQ.

I use atompub\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to expose different hierarchical =\r\ncollections of members.I would like\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the client being an interactive c=\r\nommand line tool. Additionally to be\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; used as a feed reader, a consume=\r\nr of the CLI would probably use it\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; for: bookmarking a collection; ref=\r\nreshing bookmarked collections;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; using diff tools to compare local fil=\r\nes and then POSTing the output\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; content to a collection; etc.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; The biggest challenge I face is how the CLI could use the client\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nenvironment executables files restfully?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I need to access the d=\r\niff tools on the client-side system. Does it\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; fail any constraints the=\r\n fact that the CLI would try to access the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; diff executable tools unde=\r\nr the hood? I would provide to the consumer\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the hypermedia controls n=\r\necessary to fill in the arguments that will\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; be passed to the executab=\r\nles. Just like HTML forms. What about\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; code-on-demand instead? The cli=\r\nent would executes, as an example,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; shell scripting fragment depending=\r\n on the client environment setup\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; capabilities. Just like the browser =\r\nexecutes JavaScript? It has some\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; advantages that the client could be =\r\npartly able to update itself.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Otherwise I would need to let the=\r\n server do the diff which will be\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; retrieve by the client. But the cli=\r\nent and the server will most of the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; time be on the same machine or lo=\r\ncal network. The client needs to\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; access the file system and do operat=\r\nions on files, which the local web\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; server could do.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Any a=\r\ndvices?
