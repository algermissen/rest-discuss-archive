The onClick for the\nlink calls script that submits a non-visible form in a zero or one pixel\nhigh frame. This can be used to communicate with the server without bumping\ninto UI/presentation issues.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; So you&#39;re of the opinion that, given the design constraints, it would be\n&gt; preferable to massage the requests to POSTs using javascript than to issue\n&gt; GET requests without relying on javascript?\nIf doing a GET modifies data on the server, then I would use POST - even if\nthat means using script on the client.\nWhat happens if the user clicks the same link twice?\nHow does a user remove the column name from the view?\nWhat happens when a spider crawls the link?\nWhat happens when a user bookmarks a link or drags the link to their\ndesktop?\nWhat does the user see when they click link A, then link B, then link A? The\nsecond time they click link A they won&#39;t see the same as the first time they\nclicked on link A - it&#39;ll look like they are still on link B.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; unless the semantics for the /view URL dictate that, absent a specific\n&gt; identifier, the current view for the user is the one being modified. Is\n&gt; that legit from a REST pov?\nNo. The resource identifier should identify the same resource for all\nclients.\nIf you generate the HTML for the tree control with href= links that have the\nuserid in a query term, then that isn&#39;t a problem.\nIt makes the HTML slightly larger though.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 1. I&#39;m not specifying the view id in the change request. Due to the\nfact\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that I don&#39;t want to regenerate the link tree, though, this is largely\n&gt; &gt;&gt; unavoidable. I&#39;ll just store the user&#39;s active view id in their\nsession,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; but always redirect them to a URL which they can use absent a session.\n&gt; &gt;Tell me again why using a viewId causes the tree to change?\n&gt;\n&gt; because I don&#39;t know the view id until the user has created one by\nclicking\n&gt; on a link in the tree. It would be undesirable for a couple of other\n&gt; reasons as well, actually.\nWhat about always having a view ID for each user - even if it is empty.\nThe tree would always have that URI in the href= links.\n\n\n&gt; So the upshot seems to be that, given my constraints, the links in the\n&gt; explorer should silently turn into POST requests, which send back 303\n&gt; redirects to a long-lived URL for the dataset view. I can live with that,\n&gt; thanks for the conversation.\n\nNo problem. But this conversation is like many I&#39;ve had when designing\nsystems in the past.\nIt&#39;s also very indicative of why I believe that REST based resource\nmodelling is best suited for &#39;automation&#39; based Web systems and classical UI\nbased systems with existing browsers & server technology just run into too\nmany issues that are counter to good REST based design. Essentially I\nbelieve that usability requirements (projected onto browsers and their use\nof HTTP) conflict with REST principles projected onto HTTP.\n\nSo, it&#39;s okay to strive for RESTfulness with HTML and browsers, but don&#39;t\nsweat the (sometimes major) conflicts that are going to pop up.\n\n\n\n"}}
