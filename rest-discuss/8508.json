Pagaltzis wrote:\n\n&gt; Obviously if the intermediary saw anything other than a 2xx, it\n&gt; couldnâ€™t cache the request body. But even if it did see a 2xx\n&gt; response, the semantics of PUT (namely, that the origin server\n&gt; may do anything it wants with the request body) would seem to\n&gt; absolutely preclude caching by intermediaries. \n\nThat;s an arguable point. Some people think it&#39;s OK for the origin \nserver to do anything it wants with a PUT body and still return a 200 \nOK. Some people think that&#39;s not acceptable. The semantics of PUT are \nnot in consensus within the community.\n\nGiven that some servers may change the body of the PUT because some \ndevelopers believe that&#39;s OK, it is probably not safe for a cache to \nstore a PUT body, whether that would be legal according to the spec or not.\n\nPerhaps cache-control headers in PUT responses could be used to clarify \nthis? E.g. id the server is going to change the body it should send \ncache invalidating headers in the PUT response?\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
