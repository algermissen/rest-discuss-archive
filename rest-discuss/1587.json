I would &quot;POST&quot; an\n&gt; action-request and the action-request might have an &quot;action&quot; attribute\n&gt; which was a verb. In that particular case yes, I&#39;ve pushed a verb into\n&gt; the representation. But it stays there. I expect a new URI to \n&gt; be created\n&gt; that *has that verb in it*. If it is a multiplayer game, I will get\n&gt; everybody else in sync by pointing them at the resource I \n&gt; created. They\n&gt; will fetch the verb-containing representation and do the \n&gt; right thing on\n&gt; their screens. \n\nPaul, I agree with pretty much everything on this post, especially the\nexample outline in the above paragraph.  It is essentially the special type\nof example where a verb can be useful (not required, but useful).  It allows\nthe representation of the action-request to have a URI.  This is kind of\nwhat I&#39;ve been trying to get at from the beginning.  Maybe I&#39;m getting\ncloser to REST Zen. 8-)\n\n//Joe\n\nThis email message, and any attachments to it, are for the sole use of the\nintended recipients, and may contain confidential and privileged\ninformation.
