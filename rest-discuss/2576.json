If the naming\n&gt; scheme changes, then so does the instructions.\n\nThen you have to rename all of your old resources to follow the scheme, \nright? My point is that the naming convention for your new resources \nshould not be constrained by history nor vice versa. And anyhow, except \nfor web browsers, most web app client software is not really written to \ndiscover parameters at runtime.\n\n&gt;...\n&gt; Okay, I get the indirection bit, but along the way I wondered\n&gt; how the client knew how to do that GET.  Did I tell her how to\n&gt; format that?\n\nYes, using something like WSDL or WRDL or XForms. In retrospect I was \nwrong to say that XForms MUST be used at runtime. There&#39;s no reason it \nisn&#39;t also useful at design time. I&#39;ll have to think about this aspect \nof XForms more...\n\n &gt;...\n&gt; Hmmm.  I think you&#39;re still assuming that there is a finite\n&gt; number of these resources and that given the right question,\n&gt; the server can dish up a finite set of references for getting\n&gt; at them.  Time ain&#39;t like that.\n\nSurely your app is not interested in all of eternity. There are a finite \nnumber of changes that happen.\n\n&gt; While asking the original question, I realized that a better\n&gt; application design on the server side keeps a versioning history\n&gt; and so could offer a list of versions as you have above. \n&gt; Unfortunately, the legacy app hiding behind my web service\n&gt; wasn&#39;t that smart. 8-(\n\nIt must have a version history internally or how can it answer the \nquestion of &quot;what was the value on this date?&quot; But if you say that the \nversion history is externally unavailable then I believe you. That&#39;s too \nbad: it constrains your design.\n\nAnyhow, it doesn&#39;t change the point about how to deine query interfaces. \nIf you want to adhere closely to Web architecture, you should do some \nkind of indirect/redirect through the query so that the resource \nrelationships are not name-based.\n\nIt might be a valid engineering choice to short-circuit the \nquery-redirect for simplicity or performance reasons. If so, I&#39;d suggest \nstill to use query params rather than slashes for compatibility with \ntoday&#39;s Web and with languages like HTML, WRDL and XForms.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
