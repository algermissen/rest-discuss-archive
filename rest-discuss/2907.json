It&#39;s your choice.  I&#39;d opt for a combo of\n&gt; #1 and #2 if I can, i.e. if no XML schema is mandated.\n\ni think (after studying the article referenced below again) the XML\nrepresentation could have RDF merged in to it, or to put it another way,\nbe &#39;annotated&#39; with RDF.  and of course there&#39;s nothing to stop you\nhaving a seperate RDF representation as well (presuming RDF has its own\nmime type already).  and these do indeed seem to be mutually exclusive,\ni.e. you can do one without having to do the other.\n\nthe way i see it, one of the nice things about designing a RESTful\nsystem is that you&#39;re &#39;forced&#39; or constrained to consider which things\nshould be resources, which should be properties of resources, etc.  thus\nyou end up treating the design of the system as (mostly) a matter of\nresource modelling.  i suspect that RDF will fit in here very nicely\nbecause it just models all your resources and properties as a graph.\n\n&gt; Just use RDF/XML instead of just XML.  I found this article wonderful,\n&gt; both as a guide for how to introduce some RDF into your XML, but also\n&gt; as an intro to RDF (assuming you grok the very basics, i.e. triples);\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/10/30/rdf-friendly.html\n\nthanks for the pointers.  i think i&#39;m ready to start playing with this now.\n\nregards,\n-vincent\n\n\n"}}
