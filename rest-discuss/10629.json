An important aspect of good use of HTTP is that the message is\n&gt;  self-descriptive. This one isn&#39;t anymore -- any recipient that isn&#39;t\n&gt;  aware of the Amazon extension will simply create an empty resource.\n\nQuibble: Agents aren&#39;t going to PUT  messages like that to just any\nURL -- only to URLs they&#39;ve been instructed  will understand them (by\nsome previous hypertext, or by reading AWS documentation).\n\nThe problem is that generic agents that know how to PUT e.g. HTML5\nforms and Atpompub clients, can&#39;t do this kind of PUT correctly.\n\nAlthough I can imagine crazy arguments that that&#39;s a defect in HTML5\nor Atom, since *theoretically* you could have a hypertext language\ntelling how to form arbitrary HTTP entity headers for any request.  In\nwhich case assholes [1] could argue that the AWS copy is RESTful.\n\n\nHugh\n(Moron)\n\n[1]http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/08/16/specs\n\n"}}
