Is this correct ?\n\nRegards\nDevdatta\n\n2008/5/6 Roy T. Fielding &lt;fielding@...&gt;:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; There seems to be a common thread with most posts here. People\n&gt;  have been busy modeling everything as a resource and now they\n&gt;  want to know how to do everything in a PUT or DELETE instead of\n&gt;  any of the other HTTP methods. That is wrong. That is thinking\n&gt;  HTTP is just a &quot;Save as...&quot; dialog.\n&gt;\n&gt;  REST is not limited to GET, PUT, and DELETE. Anyone who says so\n&gt;  is just making things up as they go along. REST is limited to the\n&gt;  client being told what to do next by the current state of where\n&gt;  they are now, aside from the entry point(s) we call a bookmark.\n&gt;  That is feasible because the set of methods is uniform, not because\n&gt;  it is limited to CRUD. POST is an equal party in the REST interface,\n&gt;  particularly when actions are being applied to the resources that\n&gt;  are a composite of multiple source resources. So is PATCH.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Doing RESTful actions on multiple resources is no different from\n&gt;  selecting multiple tunes in iTunes and using the info dialog\n&gt;  to set certain properties across all selected tunes. It is a UI issue.\n&gt;  The UI builds a set of actions to perform and then performs them\n&gt;  in whatever way is most efficiently provided by the set of resources\n&gt;  being operated upon. If those resources (or, rather, the index to\n&gt;  those resources) say they can be operated upon as a group by POST\n&gt;  of a selection form, then so be it -- that is perfectly RESTful\n&gt;  even without the benefit of per-resource cache invalidation.\n&gt;  Likewise for PATCH or PUT to a meta-resource, or PROPPATCH to a\n&gt;  WebDAV resource, it is RESTful if there is some engine described\n&gt;  by a representation provided by the origin server that instructs\n&gt;  the client on what to do next.\n&gt;\n&gt;  The goals are to remove coupling and maximize the number of\n&gt;  reusable resources.\n&gt;\n&gt;  ....Roy\n&gt;  \n\n"}}
