How are we going to utilize this environment\n&gt; to improve interoperability in apps? A little bit of mind shift would\n&gt; be a very simple but very essential first step.\n\nHmm. Okay, but here&#39;s my paradoxical mind shift for you:\n\n&quot;The way to improve interoperability\n  is not to add functionality\nbut to remove it by adding constraints.&quot;\n\nThat is, I believe the single most useful way to improve  \ninteroperability is by *taking away* degrees of freedom, so there&#39;s  \n*fewer* ways to define and describe web services.  That way, there&#39;s  \nmuch greater likelihood that two independently developed apps will be  \ninteroperable.\n\nObviously if you go too far in this direction you get something  \nuseless.  Hence, Einstein&#39;s dictum:\n\n&quot;Keep things as simple as possible -- but no simpler!&quot;\n\nThat&#39;s why for me the question is, &quot;What is the simplest thing that  \ncould *possibly* work?&quot;\n\nThat&#39;s why I like the idea of specifying REST APIs simply as &lt;form&gt;  \n-- if its rich enough for the human web, it ought to be rich enough  \nfor the machine-readable web.\n\n-- Ernie P.\n\n\nOn Nov 4, 2005, at 8:15 PM, toydi wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi Ernie,\n&gt;\n&gt; On 11/5/05, Dr. Ernie Prabhakar &lt;drernie@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; The question is, what problem are you trying to solve?\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not trying to propose another WSDL, but suggesting a little mind\n&gt; shift on how we look at our web-based applications as a *collection of\n&gt; resources*.\n&gt;\n&gt; [Why resources?]\n&gt; A REST style system (e.g Web) provides infrastructures to identify\n&gt; resources and manipulate resources&#39; state. This *little mind shift\n&gt; will be enough to change* the way we design apps and software tools to\n&gt; utilize Web environment, and nurture a web interoperable environment.\n&gt;\n&gt; To further setting up the web interoperable environment, developers\n&gt; are encouraged to describe resources they need, share them, and reuse\n&gt; them within their community. When a group of people are using the same\n&gt; resources in their applications, interoperability will not be an\n&gt; issue.\n&gt;\n&gt; [Describe resources?]\n&gt; About the xml example in previous message, again, that&#39;s not another\n&gt; WSDL. ;-) I&#39;m just trying to figure out what&#39;s needed to be described.\n&gt;\n&gt; In fact, I think developers are free to describe resources using\n&gt; current design tools (e.g UML&#39;s Class Diagram) or resource description\n&gt; tools (e.g TopicMaps, RDF) and share them within their community. Of\n&gt; course, RSDC will be another potential description tool. :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; IMHO, the reason we describe resources, is just to synchronize and\n&gt; improve interactions among apps that we are building. Any tools will\n&gt; do. The point is do not describe resources your own, but discuss,\n&gt; identify, describe and reuse resources within a community. It&#39;s a way\n&gt; to promote interoperability.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [Back to the question]\n&gt;&gt; The question is, what problem are you trying to solve?\n&gt;\n&gt; Improve interoperability. :-) Now, we have Web (or REST) as a\n&gt; distributed environment.
