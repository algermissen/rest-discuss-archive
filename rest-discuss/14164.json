Subbu published an article one\nyear ago today on this very subject [4]. While I differ slightly on\nthe details, the major parts are there.\n\nAnyone else have a best practice on documenting media types and link rels?\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\n\n[1] http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/links.html#edef-LINK\n[2] http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/types.html#h-6.12\n[3] http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/present/styles.html#style-external\n[4] http://www.infoq.com/articles/subbu-allamaraju-rest\n\n\nOn Wed, Dec 16, 2009 at 15:27, Jan Algermissen &lt;algermissen1971@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On Dec 16, 2009, at 7:39 PM, Will Hartung wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The media-type would have informed me what\n&gt;&gt; the &quot;rel=&#39;next&#39;&quot; link means.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sure. But how did you know that it makes sense to write code that looks for\n&gt; the rel=&quot;next&quot; in the first place? Or: how did you know it makes sense to\n&gt; expect that the response would be available in application/atom+xml?\n&gt;\n&gt; As a human, you do the GET, see what is returned and if you understand it.\n&gt; Then, if you do, you know what you can do next. All fine.\n&gt;\n&gt; When coding a client, however, you need to know at design time that it makes\n&gt; sense to expect application/atom+xml to be returned. There might be other\n&gt; possible media types available, too, but you need some source of information\n&gt; that is the source for this expectation.\n&gt;\n&gt; AtomPub, for example, does state that collections are available as\n&gt; application/atom+xml feed documents. And it needs to do so because\n&gt; otherwise, building a client would not be possible.\n&gt;\n&gt; AtomPub cannot make that statement without using the term &#39;collection&#39; and\n&gt; specifying how a client knows that a resource is a (sic!!) collection[1]. An\n&gt; AtomPub collection is a resource kind (or class or category or role type or\n&gt; type or whatever you name it).\n&gt;\n&gt; Jan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; [1] And it does so (more or less implicitly) by saying that whatever URIs\n&gt; you find in the href attributes of a service document&#39;s collection elements\n&gt; refers to collections. When I see\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;collection href=&quot;http://foo/orders&quot;&gt; I know a bunch of things about the\n&gt; resource identfied by http://foo/orders. E.g. I know that a GET on it will\n&gt; return an Atom feed.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
