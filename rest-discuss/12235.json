In any case there is no clear\n&gt; requirement that sub-resources outlive their super-resources. Unless\n&gt; I am missing something, collection deletion could be in a sense\n&gt; transactional.\n&gt; \n\nOr &quot;member resources&quot; as the example I gave was in Atom.  Deletion of\ncollections, AFAIK, is entirely unspecified -- which is why I said that\napplication behavior is up to the developer.  I&#39;m not arguing against\nhaving the deletion of a collection result in the deletion of all\nmembers/subordinates.  I&#39;m arguing that doing things that way violates\nthe uniform interface constraint.  The pertinent question is, &quot;what\nproblem does batch deletion solve?&quot;  I still say it&#39;s a nitpicky\noptimization of an insignificant amount of traffic, at best, so even\nthe tiniest of reasons not to do it should suffice.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
