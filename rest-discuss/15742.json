As I\nm=\r\nentioned earlier in this thread, it would be interesting to discuss\nthe mer=\r\nits of using URNs in Content-Location -- a discussion which\npresupposes tha=\r\nt variants need identifiers (REST), instead focusing on\nimplementation (HTT=\r\nP).\n\nFailure to use URIs to identify resources, is not a violation of the\ni=\r\ndentification of resources constraint.  Failure to identify resources\nwithi=\r\nn your system by assigning them identifiers, violates the\nconstraint.\n\nIt o=\r\nnly &quot;makes sense that you can&#39;t violate the identification of\nresources con=\r\nstraint within a specific system&quot; if you are trying to\ndefine REST in a way=\r\n which fits your agenda, or if you are\nmisunderstanding what a resource *is=\r\n*.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Why you think that all variants must also be resources in =\r\ntheir own\n&gt; &gt;&gt; right?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If a resource varies between HTML and At=\r\nom representations, then\n&gt; &gt; those two variants, taken separately, must hav=\r\ne some abstract\n&gt; &gt; definition that is different from one another, and is a=\r\nlso\n&gt; &gt; different from the abstract definition of the negotiated resource\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; whose URI they share.\n&gt; \n&gt; No, they have the *same* abstract definition =\r\n- which is the reason\n&gt; they are identified as representations of a resourc=\r\ne that can be\n&gt; negotiated, and not completely independent resources.\n&gt; \n\nT=\r\nwo variants have the same abstract definition, if they share a URI.\nThis do=\r\nes not restrict those variants from each having an infinite\nnumber of other=\r\n possible abstractions.  Applying the identification of\nresources constrain=\r\nt, consists of assigning identifiers to any other\nabstractions important to=\r\n the system.\n\nWhen you are varying media types (or anything besides compres=\r\nsion), the\nabstractions of each variant of /concept as a specific media typ=\r\ne (i.e. \n/concept.atom and /concept.html as &#39;concept as Atom and only Atom&#39;=\r\n and\n&#39;concept as HTML and only HTML&#39;) are important to the system, and are\n=\r\ndifferent from &#39;concept as varying media type&#39;.\n\nThis holds true whether yo=\r\nu assign URIs to identify these additional\nresources, or not.  Your counter=\r\n to this, is to keep insisting that\nonce you&#39;ve declared a negotiated resou=\r\nrce, its variants are not\nallowed to be representations of any other resour=\r\nce, regardless of how\nmany times it&#39;s pointed out to you that REST explicit=\r\nly endorses this\nvery behavior (author&#39;s preferred version).\n\nThe only thin=\r\ng you can accomplish by dragging this debate out, is\nexposing flaws in one =\r\nexplanation or another that I&#39;ve posited, which\ndoes not change the best pr=\r\nactice of assigning URIs to variants like\nRFC 2616 says you SHOULD.\n\nIOW, I=\r\n&#39;m not arguing that assigning URIs to variants *should* be best\npractice.  =\r\nI&#39;m explaining *why* it *is* best practice.  Rejecting my\nexplanations will=\r\n not change established best practice.  Nor will\nfailing to explain how thi=\r\ns best practice violates REST -- insisting\nthat a variant can only have one=\r\n URI, that of the negotiated resource,\ngoes against REST completely.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; T=\r\nhe difference between an Atom and HTML representation is *not*\n&gt; abstract a=\r\nt all Eric, that is why you are able to transform via XSLT\n&gt; from Atom to H=\r\nTML.\n&gt; \n\nI can&#39;t make heads or tails out of that statement.  How do you get=\r\n from\nmy statement that variants have multiple abstractions, to a claim tha=\r\nt\nthe differences between variants are abstract?  If anything, I&#39;ve\npointed=\r\n out that the differences between &quot;concept as HTML and only HTML&quot;\nand &quot;conc=\r\nept as Atom and only Atom&quot; are anything but abstract.\n\nThese concrete diffe=\r\nrences are exactly why these variants require\ndifferent abstractions to be =\r\nidentified, i.e. why variants must be\ntreated as resources in their own rig=\r\nht.  No such concrete differences\nexist with compression variants, making t=\r\nhem unimportant to the system,\nand therefore not requiring URIs.\n\nGranted, =\r\nXSLT may be used to transform Atom into HTML, but the\nsemantics of Atom are=\r\n lost -- the user agent must be informed of, and\nunderstand, some domain-sp=\r\necific vocabulary to map the semantics of\nHTML to the semantics of Atom -- =\r\nyou can&#39;t tell just from the media\ntype what hypertext relates to &quot;author&quot; =\r\nand what hypertext relates to\n&quot;updated&quot; or anything else.\n\nAtom and HTML va=\r\nriants may represent the same concept when taken\ntogether, but when taken s=\r\neparately they also represent other concepts.\nA failure to recognize that t=\r\nhese variants also represent other\nresources, by identifying those resource=\r\ns, is a failure to apply the\nidentification of resources constraint.
