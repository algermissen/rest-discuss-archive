And the Uniform Interface constraint (composed of\nthe constraints identification of resources, manipulation of resources\nthrough representations, self-descriptive messages, and HATEOAS) also\ndoes not rule out centralized link servers.\n\nSo is this actually an implicit constraint that should be made\nexplicit, or is there some existing constraint in the thesis the\nclearly forbids centralized link servers.\n\n-- Nick\n\nNick Gall\nPhone: +1.781.608.5871\nAOL IM: Nicholas Gall\nYahoo IM: nick_gall_1117\nMSN IM: (same as email)\nGoogle Talk: (same as email)\nEmail: nick.gall AT-SIGN gmail DOT com\nWeblog: http://ironick.typepad.com/ironick/\nFurl: http://www.furl.net/members/ngall\n\n"}}
