There is no way to determine that by\n&gt; &gt; inspecting the identifiers, aside from scheme-defined equivalence.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think I get what you are saying, but I want to be sure. Basically  \n&gt; you are\n&gt; saying that each of the following URLs point to a DIFFERENT  \n&gt; resource as far\n&gt; as REST is concerned, correct:\n\nNo.  Why would I have said &quot;For two resources to be the same, ...&quot; if\nI thought that changing a URI always resulted in different resources?\nThey might be different resources, the client generally won&#39;t be able\nto figure that out, so the only safe assumption is that they are\ndifferent resources until stated otherwise by the server.\n\nThis is Web Architecture.  Resources are an abstraction -- a source of\ngoodness as perceived by the person who linked to that resource that\nis in the form of a value-giver over time.  There are no resources on\nthe Web -- only senders and receivers of representations that have\nthe effect of evaluating a resource mapping at invocation time,\nthereby becoming &quot;the resource&quot; as we perceive it over time even\nthough we all know it is just a finite data server at any single\npoint in time.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to choose the one true identifier that will\nalways map to the intended resource, such that the link author (and\nthe millions of people who subsequently copy or bookmark that link)\nnever have to change the link. Of course, we rarely achieve the\nultimate goal the first time, and sometimes there are many paths to\nthe ultimate goal that get explored along the way, and sometimes\npeople move the goal posts.\n\nIf there are many URIs for a given resource, the best implementation\nis for all of the other URIs to redirect to the one URI that is\ndeemed to be &quot;best&quot; for the resource&#39;s unique semantics.  The reason\nfor that is not REST or Web Architecture (though both are specifically\ndesigned to enable it): the reason is network economics as expressed\nby power laws, Metcalfe&#39;s law, PageRank, and a hundred other\nrestatements of the factors that place value on social networks.\n\nREST works because it makes absolutely no attempt to understand\nwhat the resource is, how it might be implemented, or the scope of\nhow it will change over time.  It eliminates the semantic burden of\nunderstanding by focusing only on the interface as a means of hiding\nknowledge from the other side, yet communicating all that needs to\nbe said in the same way that two people communicate -- tossing\nrepresentations across the gap with a relatively small number of\npitch inflections to indicate what is expected in return.  In short,\nREST doesn&#39;t care what the resource is or how many URIs identify\nthe same resource, because to care would require understanding that\nwould lead to coupling which is more dangerous than inefficiency.\n\nSuch communication theory is a lot more abstract than REST, REST is\na lot more abstract than Web Architecture (URI, HTTP, HTML, ...),\nand Web Architecture is somewhat more abstract than any current\nimplementation of that architecture (Apache httpd, Mozilla Firefox,\netc.).  And yet they all need to influence each other, in various\nways, when we attempt to design changes to a living system.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
