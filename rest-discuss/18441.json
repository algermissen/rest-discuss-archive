IOW, that the server would know anything about the clients ap=\r\nplication.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Am I reading that correctly?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; The state that the=\r\n client moves to when following a LO is provided by\n&gt; the server. So yes, f=\r\nor a brief moment of time the server knows a\n&gt; significant amount of inform=\r\nation about the state the client is moving\n&gt; to. I say for a brief moment, =\r\nbecause that returned representation\n&gt; may be created based on information =\r\nprovided in the request that the\n&gt; server does not hold onto.\n&gt; The server =\r\ndoes not know everything about the client state because,\n&gt; the client may h=\r\nave accumulated other state during its travels.\n\nYes, I agree.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d =\r\nreply that the application is entirely a concern of the client. The questio=\r\nn of whether a link that the client has seen at some point in time can be u=\r\nsed to construct some successful future request (with the goal of satisfyin=\r\ng some intent) is not part of any application semantics.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; You are corr=\r\nect in that the client has every right to go and dig up an\n&gt; old link and t=\r\nry and re-use it. However, it is also in the best\n&gt; interests of the client=\r\n to use the information provided to it by the\n&gt; server to make the smartest=\r\n decisions. If a server returns a\n&gt; representation that does not contain a =\r\nlink that was previously\n&gt; available, then it would probably be wise not to=\r\n present it as an\n&gt; option to the human. \n\nAh, yes - that is a interesting =\r\nway to express that. Good.\n\n&gt; I tend to use link relations as a way of hint=\r\ning\n&gt; to clients which links are safe to hold onto and which ones are not.\n=\r\n\nTo me, this is the topic of &#39;bookmarkability&#39; - how does the client know w=\r\nhat links are good to hold on to and which are the ones that are not. Open =\r\nfor research, IMHO. You seem to think it goes (to some extend) into the lin=\r\nk semantics spec, yes? I think that, too.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; In addition I&#39;d reply tha=\r\nt the application state is not comprised of only the response to the previo=\r\nus request but of *all* responses to previous requests that the client (on =\r\n&#39;behalf&#39; of the application being executed) was instructed to keep track of=\r\n. If the application is to search trough a number of online stores to find =\r\na certain book and if I keep open 20 windows in my browser, each displaying=\r\n a response, then the application state is comprised of all those open wind=\r\nows.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I would agree that application state can be viewed as an aggr=\r\negate of\n&gt; numerous different interactions. I model that within my client a=\r\ns a\n&gt; set of independent &quot;agents&quot;. Each open window would have it&#39;s own\n&gt; a=\r\ngent and every agent has the state of the last LO response and and\n&gt; subseq=\r\nuent LE requests from that LO response.\n\nAh, ok. I tend to think one agent =\r\nhaving many last responses (open windows). Also interesting to compare the =\r\ntwo views.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Makes sense?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; It does, but I&#39;m not seeing any cont=\r\nradictions in our opinions. \n\nNo, did not mean that. I just wanted to make =\r\nsure you do not think anything which I&#39;d completely disagree with - otherwi=\r\nse I would get confused, and all :-)\n\n&gt; The\n&gt; only difference I see is that=\r\n I tend to view the client as a slave of\n&gt; the servers it interacts with an=\r\nd other people seem to see it the\n&gt; other way around.\n\nAh, right. I view th=\r\ne client as just using the servers as it sees fit (given its own intended a=\r\npplication). OTH, if you define a media type you necessarily are guided by =\r\nsome perceived &#39;canonical application&#39; to be achieved with that type (e.g. =\r\ncreate and edit blog entries in the case of AtomPub). And necessarily this =\r\nconstrains the stuff that the client can do with that media type quite a bi=\r\nt. And also does the server offer the client hypermedia controls (e.g. link=\r\ns) that the server things make sense for the client. So the client is also =\r\na slave to the server in what *can* actually happen.\n\nThanks for clarifying=\r\n.\n\nJan\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Darrel\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
