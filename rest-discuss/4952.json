From my reading of the spec they work at the transfer layer (HTTP) for retrieving parts of representations that were only partly downloaded.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYes, byte ranges will work as you describe, however there seems to be no \nreason that other range units could not be defined in the future and the \nspec doesn&#39;t forbid this. (Here we are walking along the thin line which \nforms the very edge of HTTP-land.)\n\n&gt;I also think it would be inappropriate to extend the Range headers to include page information because then the URI would mean different things depending upon the Range headers.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI don&#39;t follow you - Consider the above satement in light of other \naccept headers such as content or language encoding. As always, the URI \nwill specify the resource, regardless of the headers.\n\n&gt;Sometimes that is appropriate, for example when the representation differs depending upon authorization credentials, but in this case I think it would be inappropriate. For one thing it would be impossible to bookmark the page.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nOkay, so we agree that this approach in general will be more or less \nappropriate depending on the specific application - I stated as much in \nmy previous email. Yet there is nothing special about &#39;bookmarkability&#39; \nwhich factors into this, as bookmarks are neither part of REST nor HTTP. \n... It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t appreciate the usefullness of bookmarks, but \nit is important to acknowledge that the web browser doesn&#39;t define REST \nor HTTP and is, in fact, a rather impoverished client as far as both are \nconcerned. This has been discussed several times before on the list. \nRegarding bookmarkability, there is no reason that some client, an \nHTTP-based eBook reader, for example, couldn&#39;t bookmark both the URI and \nlocation within the resource as either a byte position or page number.\n\n&gt;I have often wondered what Range headers could be used for at the application level. The only practical use I can think of is to get the tail of a resource that is constantly being extended. Kind of a &#39;tail -f&#39; over the internet.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThat is a fine example, thanks. Another good set of examples / use cases \ninvolve clients with limited device profiles accessing large media files \n- music, video or large PDFs, perhaps, or other content types may be \ndefined in the future. ... Digitized microfish may also be a reasonable \nuse case, depending on how the resources are broken up, but I can \nimagine requesting a page range from a newspaper printed a hundred years \nago and getting a multipart response back with an image in each part. In \nsome cases there may be a direct correlation between byte ranges and \npage ranges depending on the application and / or media type.\n\nThat being said, there is a pragmatic aspect to the original question \nwhich should not be ignored but, after all, this is rest-discuss as \nopposed to, say, web-applications-circa-2005-discuss. Hopefully \nexploring the various possibilities mentioned in this thread hasn&#39;t been \ntoo much of a turn off for those list  members burdened with actually \ndelivering functional web-based applications.  :-D\n\n\nBest,\nElias\n\n"}}
