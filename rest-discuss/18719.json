RDF, as you know, is perfectly\n&gt; compatible with using non-HTTP (non-&#39;URL&#39;) IRIs.\n\nyou&#39;re right here, and my apologies for not being crystal-clear about \nthis. and this is where the trouble started. conflating identifiers and \ninteraction traded easily demoable cuteness for a more robust solution \nthat would allow identity and interactions to be clearly and cleanly \nseparated, allowing described things and descriptions to be distributed \nin any way applications would like to do it. this design decision has \ncaused all kinds of fallout, and httpRange-14 is only one of them. \nband-aids such as VoID are another one.\n\n&gt; As it goes I&#39;m perfectly open (if expressivity is not lost) to using\n&gt; &quot;describedby/described&quot; relations, and am not tied (if consensus shifts)\n&gt; to the HTTP-range14 solution, for publishing/consuming Linked Data.\n\nthat&#39;s great to hear, so could you please have a very brief look at \nhttp://www.jenitennison.com/blog/node/168#comment-11727 and say whether \nyou think you&#39;re losing anything in such a setting? in fact, i would \neven claim you win a lot because now having descriptions of descriptions \nbecomes very cleanly covered, which is sort of a problem for the hash \nURI or 303 approaches. also, we can just use the existing machinery \n(link relation type registry) and don&#39;t have to meddle with \nwell-established principles such as URI opacity or overload HTTP status \ncodes.\n\n&gt; On the other hand, when people complain about the thing/document\n&gt; distinction (preferring ambiguity), and throw in the name HTTP-range14\n&gt; as if that&#39;s an RDF necessity, then that&#39;s disingenuous, as no solution\n&gt; is going to work for them. They prefer to ignore the distinction\n&gt; altogether. This I can not even entertain.\n\nwell, the fact is that for the vast majority of people it simply is not \na problem, so they don&#39;t ignore it because they dislike it; it just \ndoesn&#39;t matter. and for those more nuanced users where this distinction \nmatters, i&#39;d say that the distinction always is contextual and thus \nshould be provided as context and not as indistinguishable part of \nidentity (as in hash URIs), and then the web&#39;s existing mechanisms \nhandle this effortlessly by allowing you to register link relations and \nrelate the thing/document pairs that in your application context need to \nbe related in that way.\n\ni would really appreciate if you tried to explain what is wrong with \nsuch an approach, and why the describedby/describes relation is so \nradically different from other relation types that it cannot be treated \nlike other links that applications would like to establish between web \nresources.\n\nthanks a lot and cheers,\n\ndret.\n\n-- \nerik wilde | mailto:dret@...  -  tel:+1-510-2061079 |\n            | UC Berkeley  -  School of Information (ISchool) |\n            | http://dret.net/netdret http://twitter.com/dret |\n\n"}}
