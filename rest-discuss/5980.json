It seems that the two resources\n\n    http://example.com/bank/statements/200604/alan.dean\n\n    http://example.com/bank/statements/200604/lyle.kopnicky\n\nwould share a lot in common.  The two pages probably share the same \nbasic structure, with just some different details.  So by describing \nthem with different URLs, we are not taking advantage of the cachability \nof that common structure.  How could we take advantage of the commonalities?\n\nYou can&#39;t solve it by redirecting both to the same page - then you&#39;ve \nlost the uniqueness of that resource.  I guess one way to solve it is, \nthat the page downloaded would be a sort of &quot;shell&quot; with JavaScript that \ndownloaded the common features (e.g. page layout in HTML), and the \ncustomer-specific features (e.g. statement line items in XML), from \ndifferent URLs, and then combined them.\n\nIt seems that REST, at least in the HTML context, relies heavily on \nclient-side processing, like JavaScript.  It discourages server-side \nconstruction of pages.\n\n-- \nLyle Kopnicky\nSoftware Project Engineer\nVeicon Technology, Inc.\n\n\n"}}
