That means that the\n&gt; result of two PUTs is the same as the result of\n&gt; one PUT.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t think that is true of notifications.\n&gt; In particular, do two notifications mean that the\n&gt; original object changed once or that it changed\n&gt; twice?  So the semantics of PUT are definitely\n&gt; wrong for notification.\n\nThe notification doesn&#39;t say whether the resource changed once or twice.  It\nonly means that the watched resource has a new state since the subscription was\ncreated.\n\nThis is exactly the difference between updates and notifications.  An update is\nfor synchronization -- it tells you about the new state.  A notification is for\ninvalidation -- it tells you there is a new state.\n\n\n\n"}}
