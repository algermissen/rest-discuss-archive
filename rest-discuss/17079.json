It would then co=\r\nnstruct a representation to send to the server\nby iterating over the input =\r\nelements of the form, seting the values to\nones extract from my wiki (based=\r\n on it&#39;s out-of-band knowledge about\nwhat the various fields in the form me=\r\nan).  It would then make a\nrequest to the resource specified in form&#39;s @act=\r\nion with the method\nspecified in form&#39;s @method and the body constructed in=\r\n the previous\nstep.\n\nThis would fail, or work only by coincidence, if a sec=\r\nond form were\nadded to be page.\n\nIf it was the sort of system that was ok t=\r\no break occasionally I would\nprobably just live with the coupling.  Decoupl=\r\ning has real costs and\nyou should make sure you need it.  If, on the other =\r\nhand, it was a\nhigh value system, i would create a media type that specifie=\r\nd the form\nand it&#39;s inputs.  The would bring that knowledge need by the scr=\r\nipt\nin-band, and allow the script to inform the server of it&#39;s\nrequirements=\r\n.  It would also allow clients to work reliably with more\nthan one provider=\r\n of the service.  I think this may be in line with\nMike&#39;s approach of conve=\r\nrting content into structure by specifying it\nin the media type.  (Correct =\r\nme if i misunderstood you, Mike.)\n\nHow you would design such a system to av=\r\noid such coupling?\n\nPeter\n\n"}}
