Once you have received a specific message (indicated via the\n&gt; inbox), POST its URI to the URI of the mail resource you want it to be put\n&gt; in:\nI think this is a good approach for managing the messages, notifying that\nthey were processed, etc.\nBut I think the problem S. Alexander is trying to solve has to do with\nmetadata changing on a listing of items - and getting a list of just the\nchanged items.\n\nUsing a header like If-Modified-Since or If-None-Match doesn&#39;t change what\nthe resource represents - I don&#39;t think they can be used to filter out\nunmodified items in a list. I think you need to have separate resources to\ndo the filtering\n\n\n"}}
