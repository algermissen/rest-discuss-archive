It&#39;s a matter of whether the client attempts to treat it as\n&gt; anything more than an identifier or not that determines whether it&#39;s opaque.\n&gt; A RESTful client treats *all* URIs as opaque (though there has been some\n&gt; blurring of that stance lately, it seems).\n&gt;\n&gt; I think the common confusion about opacity is whether it&#39;s perceived as\n&gt; &quot;human understandable&quot; or not.  The path you give could certainly be\n&gt; interpreted by a human beyond &quot;it&#39;s an identifier&quot;, even though it\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t.  Suppose instead that you were to have used the path /19394BC3EA.\n&gt; At first blush, one might say this URI is &quot;more opaque&quot;.  However, it is no\n&gt; more opaque than your example above if the client knows attempts to\n&gt; interpret it (e.g. knows the encoding scheme you use) beyond &quot;it&#39;s an\n&gt; identifier&quot;.  It is certainly less &quot;human understandable&quot;, but that doesn&#39;t\n&gt; necessarily make it more opaque.\n\nI completely agree with your points about opacity of URIs.  I don&#39;t\nthink they are relevant to this case though.\n\nThe question is, how do I get access to a specific order document, given\nthe order number.\n\nMy original proposal was to do a tree search in a heirarchy of index\npages, where the order number guides the search.  In some index leaf\npage a pointer to the actual URI would be found.  There would be no way\nto interpret the URI structure, because it doesn&#39;t have any: the\nmapping from order numbers to URIs is basically random.  Completely\nopaque.\n\nThe alternative approach suggested by S. Mike Dierken was to put\nthe order number in the uri.  Easy to interpret, totally not opaque.\nThe client must know the significance of the final URI component in\norder to use the service.\n\nSo, which method is more ReSTful?  To me the first one is ReSTful, the\nsecond one isn&#39;t, but Mike obviously has been thinking about ReST longer\nthan I have... so I accept that I&#39;m probably missing something.\n\nMy sense is that if the goal is: &quot;Given a set of parameters, find the\ncorresponding URI&quot;, there is only one ReSTful alternative, namely the\ninefficient search method described above.  A solution that involves\nputting search information in a document and getting back a URI is\nRPC like (the intention is not described by the choice of\nPUT/POST/blah), and a solution that puts the search criteria in the URL\nrequires that the structure of the URL be well-defined and so violates\nopaqueness.
