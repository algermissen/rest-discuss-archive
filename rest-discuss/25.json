There&#39;s content negotiation to be\nconsidered.\n\n&gt; Whereas POST has no\n&gt; such semantic. So when they say &quot;data&quot; they mean a representation that\n&gt; is appropriate for GETing.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I also don&#39;t know what John means by &quot;The appropriate pair for REST\n&gt; &gt; is GET/POST&quot;.  Why &quot;pair&quot;?  Why restrict one&#39;s self to two methods\n&gt; &gt; for coordination when three is needed?\n&gt; \n&gt; You claim that three is needed (why not four) but the web more or less\n&gt; gets by with two today!\n\nREST doesn&#39;t limit the number of methods.  You might need 10 to\ncoordinate something complicated.  The point here being that there&#39;s\na whole whack load of things that can&#39;t be *efficiently* coordinated\nwith GET/POST.  Just look at Wiki.  It&#39;s doing PUT with POST, and so\nmisses out on an important optimization (caching PUTs).\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
