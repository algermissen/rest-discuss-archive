People, groups and standards bodies can  \nmint new URLs to describe different parts of\nthe conceptual space. As in Java or other OO programming languages by  \nthe way, but more flexible, since you can say that two things (eg.  \nclasses) are the same by saying that they are owl:sameAs each other  \nfor example. Different vocabularies will capture different levels of  \ndetail, and will be more or less useful for different applications.  \nBut the nice thing is that I, as a service provider, can choose the  \nvocabulary I need to put my service together, I don&#39;t have to  \nreinvent it. And if I choose one, the meaning will be clear (as clear  \nas the vocabulary at least) to my users.\n\nSo if you do this in XML you have at least the same problem. XML is  \npure syntax so you are not going to escape it. You will have to come  \nup for words to describe what you mean. So you may want to choose and  \nintegrate different vocabularies from different places, but this is  \nnot well defined in XML, as it&#39;s pure syntax. So you then have to  \ninvent a semantics anyway. And since every xml group is using their  \nown home brewed semantics, you are going to waste a lot of you and  \nyour companies time. It may not seem like this as you start off,  \nbecause using XML is such a huge improvement over what came before...\n\nBy the way, the example is really interesting. For those who want to  \nread it in other formats I really urge you to download cwm [1]. For  \nexample what does the word Service mean in the example? I can find  \nout by running\n\ncwm http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Service --base=http://purl.org/dc/ \ndcmitype/  | less\n\nThat does not work on the example.com vocabularies of course.\n\nLet me look at that example in more detail...\n\nHenry\n\n[1] python script: http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/cwm.html\n\nOn 6 Jun 2007, at 10:59, Steve Bjorg wrote:\n\n&gt; On Jun 6, 2007, at 7:56 AM, Alan Dean wrote:\n&gt; &gt; For me, an important point to remember is that knowing the primitive\n&gt; &gt; type is often not enough. For example: is a weight value that is\n&gt; &gt; represented by a double primitive a measurement in kilograms or\n&gt; &gt; imperial pounds? Think what happened to the Mars Climate Orbiter\n&gt; &gt; mixing up imperial and metric.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Easy problem to solve: stop using imperial units! What self-\n&gt; respecting engineer doesn&#39;t use metric units? :P (j/k)\n&gt;\n&gt; Semantizing data is an endless road. The next level is that units\n&gt; aren&#39;t enough, but you also need to know the time for the units\n&gt; (think currencies), then the location of the unit (conversion rates\n&gt; don&#39;t represent the true value in specific locations), and so on. We\n&gt; can reason about it in email, but we&#39;re just torturing engineers by\n&gt; building solutions on it. At some point, good enough is good enough\n&gt; and convention must rule over semantics, imo.\n&gt;\n&gt; - Steve\n&gt;\n&gt; --------------\n&gt; Steve G.
