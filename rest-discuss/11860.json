However there might be some issues.\n\n1) In the &quot;Restful WebServices&quot; book, authors suggest that query\nparameters should be used only to &quot;suggest arguments being plugged into\nan algorithm&quot; (e.g., Google&#39;s .../search?q=query). This is not the case\nof {docId} so maybe the second design is not following a &quot;best practice&quot;.\n\n2) Another potential issue could be related to caching. Squid, for\nexample, recommends to ignore query parameters for caching in its\ndefault configuration. So by using query parameters maybe I might have\ncacheable resources not cached by some intermediary.\n\n3) Other?\n\nWhat do you think? Why should I prefer the first design with respect to\nthe other or viceversa?\n\nThank you for your help.\n\n-Fabio\n\n"}}
