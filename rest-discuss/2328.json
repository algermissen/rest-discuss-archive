I don&#39;t want to get argument about what an object is or\n&gt; isn&#39;t, but SOAP services are something you can use for doing object\n&gt; oriented decomposition of a problem, whether or not its stateless.\n\nBut are there SOAP clients and server toolkits that make it practical to\ndo object oriented decomposition, including the creation and destruction\nof objects and the referencing of one object from another?\n-- \n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
