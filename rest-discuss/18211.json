[ducking for cover]\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course I have n=\r\no proof for this - I don&#39;t even know how widespread it is\n&gt; today ... so fe=\r\nel free to ignore me :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; Some will argue that we have the uniform inter=\r\nface - that&#39;s\n&gt; interoperability! To some degree they would be right - in R=\r\nEST (HTTP) we\n&gt; have uniform operations GET/POST etc. (verbs) and combine t=\r\nhis with\n&gt; resources (nouns) and get a uniform interface that everybody kno=\r\nws how to\n&gt; use.\n&gt;\n&gt; What is missing in the equation is the formats we use =\r\nto encode data. There\n&gt; is not only a bunch of different media types - ther=\r\ne is also different ways\n&gt; to use those media types. That&#39;s where interoper=\r\nability is missing in REST!\n&gt;\n&gt; As Eric puts it in\n&gt; http://tech.groups.yah=\r\noo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/18159 : &quot;even though\n&gt; that isn&#39;t how _I_=\r\n build\n&gt; systems&quot; and Mike does it in\n&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/=\r\nrest-discuss/message/18202 : &quot;i usually\n&gt; use the Atom message as a &quot;wrappe=\r\nr&quot; for an embedded payload based on\n&gt; XHTML&quot; - exposing the problem with RE=\r\nST (at least in M2M scenarios) that\n&gt; everybody simply does it their own wa=\r\ny - even when sticking to the REST\n&gt; architecture constraints.\n&gt;\n&gt; Some sys=\r\ntems are going to use XHTML with RDFa while others will use XHTML +\n&gt; Micro=\r\nformats, HAL, JSON, raw XML and so on. In the end developers will have\n&gt; to=\r\n handcraft parsers for each and every piece of data on the web - spoiling\n&gt;=\r\n the fun of having a uniform interface.\n&gt;\n&gt; Compare this to the SOAP world =\r\nwhere there is no doubt about what format to\n&gt; use: It is XML/SOAP, you get=\r\n a WSDL, and from this you auto-generate code\n&gt; and is up and running in a =\r\nfew minutes. There is exactly(*) one way to parse\n&gt; the data and there is g=\r\nood tooling for it. In the beginning this was not so,\n&gt; but then Microsoft,=\r\n IBM and others sat down and laid out guidelines for\n&gt; interoperability &quot;WS=\r\n-Interop&quot; (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WS-I), and\n&gt; things got easier.\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Now, I don&#39;t want to turn this into a REST vs. SOAP debate, that&#39;s not the=\r\n\n&gt; point! What I am trying to say is that maybe REST is missing a set of\n&gt; =\r\n&quot;RS-Interop&quot; guidelines for M2M scenarios?\n&gt;\n&gt; Right now its like in the ea=\r\nrly days of SOAP where every vendor had their\n&gt; own way of encoding data in=\r\nside the SOAP envelope. I mean - the community\n&gt; cannot even decide on whet=\r\nher minting new media types is a good or a bad\n&gt; thing! And that&#39;s a key fe=\r\nature of REST! Come on - we can do better than\n&gt; that!\n&gt;\n&gt; Neither am I tou=\r\nching upon the problem of semantically understanding the\n&gt; data - that is a=\r\n different problem that occurs after data has been extracted\n&gt; from the res=\r\nponse - and no interop profiles are going to solve that. I am\n&gt; only focusi=\r\nng on getting the numbers, the strings, the dates, the classes\n&gt; and so on =\r\nout of the response.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the time I have spent trying to understand REST=\r\n and decide on suitable\n&gt; representations and media types for my work, I co=\r\nuld have created five\n&gt; different SOAP APIs of roughly the same complexity.=\r\n You may call me stupid\n&gt; for that, but at least I don&#39;t think I am alone.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; I fear that REST will be a fad - something (maybe not so) soon to be\n&gt; =\r\nforgotten - if nothing is done to make it easier to consume the data found\n=\r\n&gt; inside REST resources. Hopefully it won&#39;t be so - personally I love the\n&gt;=\r\n benefits that we get from REST, but something is missing for it to get its=\r\n\n&gt; real break-through.\n&gt;\n&gt; And, please tell me that I am wrong ... that wou=\r\nld make REST more perfect\n&gt; for me :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for listening.\n&gt;\n&gt; /J=F8r=\r\nn\n&gt;\n&gt; (*) And, yes, SOAP has its interoperability issues too - I know.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
