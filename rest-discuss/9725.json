Sometimes they aren&#39;t even setable by the client.\n\nIf you have flags other than some kind of “active/not active”\nstatus, probably by exposing them as separate resources for the\nclient to PUT to, when it is allowed to.\n\nAnd remember that the server does not need to store a bit-for-bit\ncopy of what the client sends in PUT. If the server includes\nthose flags in the representation it returns on GET, that doesn’t\nmean clients have to be able to change them. If the client\nincludes them in a PUT the server can simply pretend they weren’t\nthere or 400 the request or do whatever.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
