Fielding wrote:\n\n&gt;&gt; So if I PUT to /foo/bar/xyz, there now exists a resource with that name\n&gt;&gt; (assuming all goes well).  Does that necessarily imply that there is now\n&gt;&gt; also a resource named /foo/bar?  That is, if I start with an empty\n&gt;&gt; hierarchy and no resources, then do a PUT to /foo/bar/xyz, is there\n&gt;&gt; anything about REST or HTTP that dictates that  I now have three\n&gt;&gt; resources rather than one?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; What is a resource?  What makes you think it didn&#39;t exist before the PUT?\n&gt;\n&gt; Yeah, I know that&#39;s an annoying answer, but it is quite pointless to be\n&gt; discussing these things if we aren&#39;t even clear on what is a resource. \n\n\nIt&#39;s only annoyting because I had to be reminded again that  I have a \nbad habit of thinking that a resource only exists when a mapping \nfunction for that resource has been implemented and is able to respond \nto a request with something other than the equivalent of a 404.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; A resource is a source for *future* responses to future requests.  Thus,\n&gt; the resource will already exist by virtue of you eventually doing the \n&gt; PUT,\n&gt; and what you are doing with those requests is changing the responses\n&gt; to future requests.  Whether or not those ancestral names, or any other\n&gt; names that might have been created by the usual side-effects, are\n&gt; accessible to future requests (and hence are resources) is defined by\n&gt; the server and not by the protocol (or even the style).\n&gt;\n&gt; The server might choose to reject the PUT request simply because it\n&gt; wants access control to be specified first.  Interoperability is\n&gt; obtained not by restricting the behavior of the server, but by\n&gt; requiring that the server respond according to its desires and\n&gt; enabling the client to understand that response.\n&gt;\n&gt; One of the keys to understanding how REST works is to understand that\n&gt; the implementations have no clue what the resource is or how it is\n&gt; defined or what, in fact, makes it a resource.  That is just too hard\n&gt; a concept for the implementations to handle.  Even the human beings\n&gt; maintaining the site have a hard time figuring that one out, because\n&gt; we just aren&#39;t very good at predicting the future.  In contrast,\n&gt; it is relatively easy to talk about representations, storing them\n&gt; and mapping them to names that are resources, since those are\n&gt; operations that manipulate bits in the &quot;now&quot; and are easy for\n&gt; server mechanisms to understand and implement.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thus, it is not necessary to know what the fate of /foo/bar/ might\n&gt; be after a\n&gt;\n&gt;    PUT /foo/bar/thing\n&gt;\n&gt; even though we do know what its fate will be after a\n&gt;\n&gt;    DELETE /foo/\n&gt;\n&gt; has successfully completed.  Note, however, that the success of the\n&gt; first request does not imply that the server must allow the second\n&gt; request.  It may choose to forbid it (for any reason).\n\n\n\nDespite the poor phrasing of my question, I think you&#39;ve answered the \nquestion that I intended to ask.  As I understand it, then, neither REST \nnor HTTP dictate the existance of any sort of relationship between \n/foo/bar/thing and /foo/bar/ other than name containment (and that only \nfrom HTTP).\n\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n"}}
