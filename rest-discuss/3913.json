For reference (RFC2616 9.5):\n\n    The POST method is used to request that the origin\n    server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a\n    new subordinate of the resource identified by the\n    Request-URI in the Request-Line.&quot;\n\nNote that this does not say that the request entity is a &quot;subordinate\nresource&quot;.  It only says that it is &quot;a new suboridnate of the resource&quot;.\nThough some may disagree, that&#39;s a world of difference.  POST never once\nclaims that the request entity is a resource.  All it claims is that the\ntarget resource can make a resource out of the request entity.  This is\nevident by the variety of functions that POST can handle:\n\n    - Annotation of existing resources;\n\n    - Posting a message to a bulletin board, newsgroup,\n      mailing list, or similar group of articles;\n\n    - Providing a block of data, such as the result of\n      submitting a form, to a data-handling process;\n\n    - Extending a database through an append operation.\n\nMake special note of the third example.\n\nNow, the POST definition also says:\n\n    The actual function performed by the POST method is\n    determined by the server and is usually dependent on\n    the Request-URI. The posted entity is subordinate to\n    that URI in the same way that a file is subordinate to\n    a directory containing it, a news article is subordinate\n    to a newsgroup to which it is posted, or a record is\n    subordinate to a database.\n\nWhen trying to clarify what the definition means by &quot;subordinate&quot;, it\nfocuses on easily visualizable concepts where &quot;subordination&quot; is already a\nwell-known concept.  This does *not* mean that this is an all-inclusive\nclarification.  The point that I think they are trying to get across is that\nthe request entity is controlled by the resource, not the other way around.\nA record cannot insert itself into a database, the database must insert a\nrecord into itself.  The same can be said for file/directories and\narticles/newsgroups.\n\nThe next part of the definition clearly points out that POST does not itself\ntreat the request entity as a resource.\n\n    The action performed by the POST method might not\n    result in a resource that can be identified by a URI. In\n    this case, either 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) is the\n    appropriate response status, depending on whether or\n    not the response includes an entity that describes\n    the result.\n\n Again, it is up the the target resource to make that decision.  (Also, I\nwould argue that 202 (and possibly any other 2xx code)  is a valid response,\nbut that&#39;s a minor issue.)\n\nAnd the last relevant part of the specification is:\n\n    If a resource has been created on the origin server,\n    the response SHOULD be 201 (Created) and contain\n    an entity which describes the status of the request\n    and refers to the new resource, and a Location header\n    (see section 14.30).\n\nNow, this part is a bit interesting.  Suppose I POST a request entity to a\nresource such that the resource creates a new resource.  According to the\ndefinition, the response entity is the &quot;status&quot; of the request, not a\nrepresentation of the new resource.  What this means to me is that even if\nthe POST operation ends with the creation a new resource, the POST itself is\nstill nothing more than what the third example above expresses.  In other\nwords, the response is still just the output of the target resource function\nbased on the input.\n\n\nAnd that&#39;s it.  POST is not complicated.  It does not have all sorts of\nadditional semantics.  Resources that are POSTed to are not necessarily\ndirectories, containers, indexes, etc.  They are just resources that accept\nPOST requests and give back a response.  That&#39;s it.  Boring, but quite\nuseful.\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
