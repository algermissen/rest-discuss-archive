What is the client going to =\r\ndo when it receives a 204?\n&gt; A 404?  A 410?  How about a 456?\n&gt; \n&gt; The poin=\r\nt of having a flexible interface is to be flexible.\n&gt; The more response cod=\r\nes you can map into &quot;success&quot;, the better.\n&gt; \n&gt; ....Roy\n&gt;\n\nRoy,\nI&#39;m with yo=\r\nu that the client should definitely be written this way. At the same time t=\r\nhough, while the server has many options, it isn&#39;t free to return absolutel=\r\ny anything no matter what happened to the request. Otherwise the response c=\r\node and the client&#39;s mapping of it to a disposition are meaningless. I know=\r\n that&#39;s perhaps an obvious statement, but there are two ways to read &quot;... a=\r\nny response code is allowed ...&quot; (one for each actor) and I just think its =\r\nworth clearly pointing out as its a key part of the mental leap to get this=\r\n stuff right.\n\nThe way I like to think of it (and I&#39;d be interested in your=\r\n take on this) is that each response code imposes a set of constraints on t=\r\nhe server&#39;s request processing, its state and the response. The server is f=\r\nree to return any response code as long as the associated constraints are n=\r\not violated. The server constraints defined for the various response codes =\r\nare really light (it&#39;s quite surprising when you skim through 2616 Sec. 10 =\r\nand look for them) so given any request, any response code is possible.\n\nTh=\r\ne response code used also implies constraints on the client processing (e.g=\r\n. reset content on a 205). So the response code is also partially about tel=\r\nling the client what to do -- it&#39;s not just a reflection of what happened d=\r\nuring request processing.\n\nAnyways, it&#39;s certainly very different from obje=\r\nct method call responses which tend to be have much more rigid constraints =\r\non the method processing (and usually little or none on the caller) and the=\r\n set of outcomes that can be represented by each response code usually don&#39;=\r\nt intersect. \n\nHope I&#39;m making sense.\nRegards,\n\nAndrew Wahbe\nhttp://linkedn=\r\notbound.net/\n\n\n"}}
