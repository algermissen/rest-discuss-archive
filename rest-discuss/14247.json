I would suggest reading Roy&#39;s blog post, here:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven \n&gt; &lt;http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven&gt;\n\n\n\n&gt; Particularly egregious are the Changeset Protocol and Store OAI\n&gt; Service. \n\nWhy?\n\nThe changeset protocol isn&#39;t worth arguing over. The OAI-PMH verbs you \ncan consider an existing protocol that needs to be gatewayed onto the \nweb. The ListRecords operation is associated with a resource and bound \nto GET. This is a straghtforward basis to associate later one with \nsomething like a &quot;rel&quot; attribute value in a format (eg RDF, which is the \nbest working example we have today of an in-band model of data). \nWorrying about the appearance of the string &quot;verb&quot; in the URL seems like \na gensym fallacy.\n\n&gt; While it&#39;s good to see Content Negotiation in action, it is\n&gt; not good to see it made part of a query URL. \n\nIt&#39;s adequate, as part of a ladder. This list is littered with conneg \nhas failed threads. So why is it not good to see it made part of a query \nURL when the model as presented in HTTP has more or less failed?\n\n\n&gt; Your supported mime types\n&gt; each have unique filename extensions, why not use those, plus Content-\n&gt; Location? \n\nWhat useful properties would that induce?\n\n\n&gt; Or the Alternates header? Or the OPTIONS method? \n\nWhat useful properties would that induce?\n\n\n&gt; Or, if\n&gt; not a filename extension, why not a URI parameter? \n\nWhat useful properties would that induce?\n\n\n &gt; Anything but using\n&gt; URI queries. In a hypertext-driven API, use &lt;link rel=&#39;alternate&#39;/&gt;.\n\nHow will the &quot;link&quot; element and the &quot;rel&quot; attribute and the &quot;alternate&quot; \nvalue been understood by a client?\n\n\n&gt; I could go on. For hours, after spending 30 minutes reviewing your\n&gt; site. Please don&#39;t promote this as a good example of a REST\n&gt; implementation.\n\nPlease don&#39;t play fetch me a rock. Produce an improved design that fits \nthe constraints or explain what properties are lost with the current design.\n\nI swear, I get tired of REST populists pointing at something, saying \nthat&#39;s not REST, without providing alternatives or explanations, \nespecially when people are making valid attempts to align with the \narchitecture.\n\nBill\n\n"}}
