The documents exchanged are not XML, but people have converted the \nEDI formats to XML, without much takeup.\n2. The most common message exchange pattern for traditional EDI is \nbatch over a VAN, that is, possible very large batches of documents \nbeing sent periodically, often weekly.  Not very SOAPy.  Or RESTful, \neither.\n3. Some people are gravitating to a conversational-style EDI, still \nusing the old document formats.  \n4. If you consider RosettaNet and ebXML to be the &quot;next generation of \nEDI&quot; (I do), then RNet is a lot like &quot;message-oriented&quot; SOAP, and \nebXML is exactly SOAP with a lot of business extensions for state-\nalighnment transactions, security, etc.  ebXML allows people to use \ntraditional EDI document formats with SOAP &quot;transport&quot;.\n\nDoes that speak to your combination of subject line and question at \nall?\n\nIt has been my contention on this list that ebXML state-alignment \ntransactions would actually work better with REST than SOAP, but that \nseems like a different topic.\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n\n"}}
