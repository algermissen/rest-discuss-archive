I guarantee that once REST becomes mainstream\n&gt; everybody will be defining their own XML data formats anyways.\n\nIf you do that, then PUTting a document with omitted elements and\nattributes means they should be deleted from the existing record,\nnot persisted from the previous state of the resource.\n\nPUT is an assertion by the client that after request processing,\nthe full state of the resource should correspond to the provided\nentity and nothing but the provided entity. Now the server is\nfree to implement this any way it wants, which it has to be, in\norder to be able to normalise the data, insert timestamps, add\nmetadata, provide thumbnails for pictures, or suchlike. It must\ntherefore be free to make assumptions about the entity that the\nclient did not specify explicitly.\n\nSo people squint and say that inserting data into the new state\nof the resource that comes from its previous state falls under\nthis. But the PUT request should be self-contained. If the result\nof the server’s pre-processing is a resource state which from the\nclient’s perspective contradicts in semantically significant ways\nthe client-asserted resource state (and that is clearly the case\nwhen you are using PUT as a make-believe PATCH), then you are\nbreaking the PUT contract and your interface is no longer HTTP’s\nuniform interface.\n\nIf you don’t like the fully general diff formats for PATCH,\ninvent an app-specific one. That’s what media types are for. This\napproach is not a good solution in the big picture (see Bill’s\nrecent post about Snowflake APIs[1]), but it is still a *much*\nbetter idea than breaking the uniform interface.\n\n[1]: http://www.dehora.net/journal/2009/01/09/snowflake-apis/\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
