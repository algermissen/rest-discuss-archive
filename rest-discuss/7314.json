An Atompub server should drive interaction with\n&gt; clients using forms, to indicate to the client what data the server\n&gt; needs, and can accept.\n&gt; \n&gt; Atom entry documents were originally designed to deliver information\n&gt; to clients. Using them to introduce information to the server raises\n&gt; some issues that working group has mostly resolved; but these issues\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t be issues if Atom servers behaved like web servers serving\n&gt; HTML forms to humans.\n&gt; \n&gt; Example: the group spent some cycles deciding, Who sets atom:id? Must\n&gt; the server preserve it if the client submits it? Hey -- it&#39;s a\n&gt; required element... should we require clients to submit invalid\n&gt; documents? etc. etc. This wouldn&#39;t be much of an issue if the client\n&gt; first retrieved a form from the server, and the server either\n&gt; requested that information or didn&#39;t.\n\nAtom Format can assume that atom:id already exist and doesn&#39;t have to \nconsider the entry lifecycle; Atom Protocol conversely has to consider \nhow entries come to be and how ids are minted.\n\nThere&#39;s more to this than you suggest; it&#39;s not just about issuance, \nit&#39;s also about permanency. One usecase/gedanken to chew on is migrating \nentries from one system or server to another. Another is manipulating \natom:id+atom:updated to spam/hijack entries. Another is enabling \nmultiple entries to be created (as will be the case in APP with photos \nor podcasts) in a forms based approach.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
