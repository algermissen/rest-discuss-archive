So to\nobtain the list of files, a client would GET the resource that represents\nthe list of files. The trick is knowing what the identifer for that resource\nis. The best way to do that form of discovery is to provide either a\ndocument with well-tagged links to the directories of interest, or provide a\ndocument with some instruction for the construction of the links.\n\n\n\n"}}
