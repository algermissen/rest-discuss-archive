I want to support\n&gt;&gt; this constraint by adding HATEOASfulness to my future applications. One\n&gt;&gt; thing I just do not understand so far about HATEOAS-via-HTTP is (and\n&gt;&gt; what other people asked me when citing Fielding in this issue): How a\n&gt;&gt; client shall actually know which http method to use to follow a link\n&gt;&gt; received with the previous request to a RESTful server? Roy answered in\n&gt;&gt; his blog that the method could be read out of the last result. But\n&gt;&gt; actually how?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; This information is part of the hypermedia semantics specified (media\n&gt;&gt; type specification or link relation specification etc). Such a\n&gt;&gt; specification can either explicitly state the method to use (see RFC\n&gt;&gt; 5023 for example) or specify a hypermedia element that tells the client\n&gt;&gt; at runtime what method to use (e.g. HTML forms).\n&gt; \n&gt; I understand that with AtomPub RFC5023 specifies that. Call me dumb, but\n&gt; what to do if I am not using AtomPub but self-made service (like a web shop\n&gt; application)? How to do it then? For example, if I am writing a web shop, an\n&gt; that one allows to place an order using a POST. How to tell a client that it\n&gt; shall use that POST? I mean, *where* to put that information in a technical\n&gt; sense?\n&gt; \n\nIn the specification of the media type (or link relation etc.) you are using.\n\nIf you do not have something like that, that specifies the semantics of your application[1] nobody can code a client that can interact with the application. Unless the client is ultimately driven by a human.\n\nAtomPub takes you quite far usually, though in my work, I use a somewhat extended version that provides for the description of &#39;single&#39; resources and for search forms[2]. I actually cannot see anything I would like to describe about the start state of a service that cannot be expressed with that extended form of AtomPub.\n\nThe client developer needs to read the media type or link relation spec and simple put that knowledge into the client code (be it directly or as a plugin).\n\nJan\n\n\n\n[1] Usually, we would want such specs for kinds of applications, of course, not just a single one.\n[2] http://www.nordsc.com/blog/?p=80\n&gt; \n\n-----------------------------------\n Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n NORD Software Consulting\n\n Mail: algermissen@...\n Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n Work: http://www.nordsc.com/\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
