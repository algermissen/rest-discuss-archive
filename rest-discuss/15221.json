How hard can it be.\n&gt; \n&gt; An=\r\nd off they go.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sending crap over HTTP =3D=3D REST. Thankfully, REST is=\r\n easier to\n&gt; pronounce than HTTP. So all my ad hoc HTTP RPC interfaces now =\r\nbecome\n&gt; REST interfaces. Simple. Just rolls of the tounge.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, the pr=\r\noblem is that REST is already understood, WELL understood.\n&gt; It just happen=\r\ns to be pretty much completely wrong.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then you have to go in to the wh=\r\nole thesis, the concepts behind it,\n&gt; the vocabulary, etc. etc. etc. &quot;Why c=\r\nan&#39;t I just POST whatever I\n&gt; want?&quot; arguments, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s hardly worth=\r\n fighting any more. It&#39;s exhausting. If folks want to\n&gt; know about REST, th=\r\ney can look it up.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you think that REST is misunderstood, then rewri=\r\nte the wikipedia\n&gt; article until it&#39;s clear, so that rather than getting in=\r\n to exhausting\n&gt; discussions, advocates can just point to that and the thes=\r\nis and tell\n&gt; folks to come back later if they&#39;re interested. They won&#39;t, H=\r\nTTP RPC\n&gt; solves 99% of the use cases that they&#39;re REALLY trying to solve, =\r\nso\n&gt; they won&#39;t make the leap to rearchitecting their system. But at least\n=\r\n&gt; it makes it easier for folks using it to make the material more\n&gt; approac=\r\nhable.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
