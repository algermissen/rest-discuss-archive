My \n&gt; current job is heavily into that at the moment as well.\n&gt; A tricky line to draw is whether when using HTTP, the HTTP \nrequest/respones \n&gt; messages are exactly equivalent to business documents (a purchase-\norder in a \n&gt; POST, and a purchase-order-ack in the response) or whether HTTP \nmessages are \n&gt; delivery vehicles and the business documents span http messages (a \nresponse \n&gt; to a POST is only a &#39;delivery acknowledgement&#39; and the purchase-\norder-ack is \n&gt; delivered to the sender somehow else (notification, new request, \netc.)\n\nDepends on the context and conditions of business relationship.\n1. &quot;I am the big dog and you will accept my order regardless.&quot;\nPurchase-order-acceptance could be the HTTP response.\n\n2. Supplier needs some time to decide whether to accept order or not.\nHTTP response is receipt-ack only, Purchase-order-acceptance is \ndelivered separately and later.  Requester must associate later \nresponse with original request to close transaction.\n\n3. Negotiated order:  supplier may be allowed to propose changes to \norder - later delivery, split deliveries, substitute product, etc.\nResponse to original order could be rejection-with-counter-offer-\npending; Counter-offer starts a new transaction.\n\n&gt; I&#39;m using the approach of transferring business documents between \nqueues \n&gt; using http messages carrying soap formatted data, the http and soap \n&gt; responses only talk about successfull delivery - the content of the \nmessages \n&gt; describe the &#39;success/failure&#39; of the business transaction.\n\nA. How do you handle timeouts?\nB. How do you handle order fulfillment?\nC. Are these B2B?  \nD. If B2B, what kind of items?  Supplies?\nProducts for resale?  Components for manufacture?\nBusiness services?  Other?\n\nThanks,\nBob Haugen\n\n\n\n"}}
