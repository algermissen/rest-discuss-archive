A filesy=\r\nstem does not encapsulate\ncomputation.\n\n&gt; For example I am not allowed to s=\r\nend a partial representation\n&gt; of a resource meaning &quot;update just these att=\r\nributes&quot;, because\n&gt; REST just allows PUTing the whole resource (please corr=\r\nect me\n&gt; if that&#39;s more flexible).\n\nIt=E2=80=99s more nuanced than that. RE=\r\nST foremostly constrains the\nintent rather than behaviour.\n\nPUT basically m=\r\neans that the client is asserting that the new\nstate of the resource corres=\r\nponds to the representation in the\nrequest body. However, the server may ho=\r\nnour that request in any\nway it chooses, incl. deriving parts of the new re=\r\nsource state\nfrom previous resource state. What=E2=80=99s crucial, though, =\r\nis that the\nclient cannot assume that this will be the case, and the server=\r\n\ncannot assume that the client intended a partial update.\n\nHaving said all =\r\nof that, we=E2=80=99re on the wrong page anyway, as this\napplies to PUT whe=\r\nreas your initial inquiry was about POST.\n\nPOST really doesn=E2=80=99t have=\r\n a lot of semantics (which makes it an\nescape hatch, but also easy to abuse=\r\n as a crutch when you=E2=80=99re\nfailing to model a problem correctly in te=\r\nrms of resources). All\nit means is that the client is asking the server to =\r\nprocess the\ngiven information somehow. A relatively narrow meaning of that,=\r\n\nwhich is the main purpose of POST and common in practice, is that\nthe clie=\r\nnt-provided information is to be used to create a new\nresource. So the desi=\r\ngn you asked about is perfectly admissible.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltz=\r\nis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
