Isn&#39;t the HTTP session management at a different\n&gt; level (transport) than the actual resource management and the\n&gt; stateless principles associated to it? In the same vein, would you\n&gt; also consider one cannot define a RESTful service over persistent\n&gt; HTTPS connections for instance?\n\nPersistent HTTPS connections as well as keep-alive persistent HTTP \nconnections make for an interesting case. I do consider them as a kind \nof session state, although arguably not state of the application \nsession, but rather session state in the transport layer. The \njustification, as far as I understand it, is that in this case being \nstateful is actually more efficient/scalable than being stateless, \nbecause establishing a new connection is more expensive than keeping an \nexisting connection open for a short time, in case it can be reused by a \nlater request.\n\nAnd the keep-alive time indeed is short. For HTTP (not sure about HTTPS) \nit is much less than 60s.\n\nThe case of a persistent connection for receiving events from the server \nis different. Such a connection can&#39;t time out after a short time, is \nhas to stay open while the client is running.\n\nAnyway, it is surely possible to say that REST is only concerned with \nthe application layer and that session state at lower levels is none of \nits business.\n\nFor reference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_persistent_connection\n\nMichael\n\n-- \nMichael Schuerig\nmailto:michael@...\nhttp://www.schuerig.de/michael/\n\n\n"}}
