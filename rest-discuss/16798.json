I thought you were on board the &quot;resource type & media type\n&gt; crunched into one field&quot; approach.\n&gt; \n\nWhen I talk about resource type, I&#39;m talking about an abstraction which\nmanifests itself in various ways in my system (hypertext, configuration\nfiles), but never in a header or any other field.  I have over a dozen\nresource types on the system I&#39;m developing, all of which negotiate\nbetween the same handful of ubiquitous media types.  Media types\nidentify generic processing models for families of forwards-backwards\ncompatible data types.\n\nThe application logic is in the interpretation of the payloads, after\nfollowing the designated processing models.  The application code has\nknowledge of the resource type, the user-agent requires none, i.e. this\nis not a concern at the protocol layer.\n\nIf I were negotiating a dozen resource types over separate handfuls of\ncustom media types, I&#39;d have complexity and interoperability issues.  I\nalso have resource types (e.g. images, scripts) which are bound to a\nsingle media type.  Currently there are 11 ubiquitous media types on my\nsystem, one opaque string masquerading as a media type, and application/\nx-www-form-urlencoded.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
