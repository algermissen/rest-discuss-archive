DELETE seems to work against the mapping of resource to\n&gt; representations, not against the mapping of identifier(s) to resources,\n&gt; as would be the case above.\n&gt; \n&gt; The linking and unlinking of identifiers to resources seems to be\n&gt; solely in the domain of the authority, not something exposed through\n&gt; the methods of HTTP.\n&gt; \n&gt; WM\n\nOK, I admit I was being a little fanciful about the hard link idea. My\n(re) reading of RFC 2616 leads me to beleive that DELETE works against\nthe resource itself. Therefore if there are multiple representations\n(and multiple URI for that resource) then I&#39;d expect they should all\nbe deleted by the request - though the RFC is not explicit on this point.\n\nI vaguely recall an earlier discussion about DELETE and content\nnegotiaon - if its relevant anyone care to summarise?\n\n\n"}}
