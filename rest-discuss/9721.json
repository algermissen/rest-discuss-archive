Apart from the obvious things such as \n| scheme and host for http\n| &gt; uri&#39;s, which can reliably derived from uri&#39;s there are \n| other uses mentioned in\n| &gt; http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/metaDataInURI-31.html \n| &lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/metaDataInURI-31.html&gt; \n| \n| All of which are specific uses at specific points.\n| \n| &gt; As a human, I can guess from \n| http://example.org/weather/Chicago \n| &lt;http://example.org/weather/Chicago&gt;  that I may try\n| &gt; to find the weather for Boston (where I&#39;ll be soon) in\n| &gt; http://example.org/weather/Boston \n| &lt;http://example.org/weather/Boston&gt;  . \n| \n| And it may or may not work.\n| \n| All a processor *knows* about the URI \n| http://example.org/weather/Chicago \n| &lt;http://example.org/weather/Chicago&gt;  is:\n| 1. That it identifies the same resource as another URI which is \n| character-for-character identical to that.\n| 2. Specific interpretation of specific components of the URI \n| that it is \n| its task to deal with.\n| \n| &gt; Whether uri&#39;s are opaque or not is a design choice made by \n| the assigner,\n| &gt; not an inherent property of uri&#39;s.\n| \n| No, no matter how you design it, a processor does not know more about \n| the meaning of a URI than it is intended to know.\n| \n| It may be its job to take the &quot;http&quot; portion and say &quot;this gets dealt \n| with by HTTP&quot;. It may be it&#39;s job to take the domain and do a \n| look up on \n| it. It may be it&#39;s job to take the pattern weather/(.*) and \n| do a look up \n| for a representation of the weather in the locale with the name that \n| matches the final bit. It may be its job simply to see if it is a \n| character-for-character match for a previously seen URI.\n| \n| Anything else in the URI is unknown to the processor. That \n| is, it is opaque.\n\nI don&#39;t get this. Is the processor in your example server-side or client-side?\nIf server-side, then it&#39;s all true what you write, but uri opacity is a client\nside issue. The server may do whatever it pleases with a uri. If you mean\nclient-side, then the &quot;(.*)&quot; in &quot;pattern weather/(.*)&quot; isn&#39;t opaque, is it?\n\nPoint is, any uri assigner, including me, may specify how it&#39;s uri&#39;s are\nconstructed, and any client (human or software) may use those specs to construct\nor deconstruct uri&#39;s. And if someone publishes such a spec, the uri&#39;s are no\nlonger opaque.\n\nRegards,\n\nMarc de Graauw\n\nhttp://www.marcdegraauw.com\n\n\n"}}
