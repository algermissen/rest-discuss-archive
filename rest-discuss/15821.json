Or when we use the term URI are we\n&gt; implicitly using URL?\n&gt; \n\nWe say URI because often we&#39;re using the URL as an identifier, rather\nthan as something to dereference.  Think of namespaces, Content-\nLocation, etc. where the URI is a reference.  REST systems use URIs all\nover the place, the same URI in one context is dereferenced, in another\ncontext it is not, so it&#39;s just easier to always say URI.  Atom IDs are\nURIs, but they aren&#39;t derefernced, so many folks use URNs, so we say\nURI because we don&#39;t specifically mean URL.  There&#39;s nothing wrong with\nsaying URL, or even URI (which should be IRI these days), the takeaway\nis that the string is more of an identifier in practice than a rigid\nlocation (locations have no meaning unless dereferenced).\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
