As I&#39;m writing a REST enabler toolkit,  \n&gt; and as i know others do exist too, it would be of great help to have  \n&gt; a test harness to ensure valid (http / webarch) behavior.\n&gt;\n&gt; What I&#39;m thinking of is a bunch of specifications for various areas  \n&gt; to be implemented using an http or rest toolit, with an automated  \n&gt; client checking for accurate responses.\n\nI&#39;ve done something broadly like this.\n\nI document a service&#39;s interface in a WADL file.  Via an XSLT  \ntransform, I generate from this a checking function which I call from  \nmy integration-test harness, once per test.  That function verifies  \nthat each of the request/response interactions does correspond to  \nsomething in the WADL file, and that everything documented in the WADL  \nfile is actually exercised in at least one test case.  It doesn&#39;t  \nwrite the tests for you, and it doesn&#39;t understand anything deep about  \nthe interaction, but it does reassure you that you haven&#39;t missed  \nanything embarassingly major.\n\nThe WADL file also allows me to generate documentation, which is nice.\n\nWADL claims to help you generate client code, in the same way that  \nWSDL magic does (or doesn&#39;t).  I don&#39;t find this use at all  \npersuasive, since part of the virtue of REST is that such services  \ndon&#39;t need the acres of boilerplate that WS-* services do.\n\nNorman\n\n\n-- \nNorman Gray  :  http://nxg.me.uk\nDept Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester\n\n\n"}}
