Yes, they may have mostly the same\n&gt; &gt; content but\n&gt; &gt; they have different breadcrumbs which mean one can&#39;t be cached and\n&gt; &gt; served\n&gt; &gt; for the other. Of course someone might argue that because the\n&gt; &gt; content on the\n&gt; &gt; different pages is so similar I should not create different\n&gt; &gt; resources; I\n&gt; &gt; should only have one. But I think that would be being pedantic in\n&gt; &gt; trying to\n&gt; &gt; optimize the caching benefit in exchange to the detriment of\n&gt; &gt; usability.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s a good point. Caching is valuable too from a usability\n&gt; perspective and a business one, because it will make the site seem\n&gt; faster to users. I can think of a few options in that case.\n&gt;\n&gt; One is to let go of the breadcrumbs. Users can use the back button to\n&gt; back up. On Firefox if I hold down the back button I get essentially\n&gt; breadcrumbs of page titles, so you could consider dropping them from\n&gt; the page itself to enable you to have a canonical URI for each concept.\n\nYou may also keep one URI for a page, display one set of possible\nbreadcrumbs in that page representation, and for any other path the\nuser takes, just replace the breadcrumbs in the DOM via javascript.\n\nYou keep the cache happy, you keep the bots happy, and the users can\nget different breadcrumbs via a separate js file refered in the page,\nthat somehow tracks their path.\n\nThe only thing that shouldn&#39;t be cacheable is that js URL (if you\ngenerate it over each request), which is anyway significant smaller\nthat the whole page.\n\nCheers,\n-- \nLaurian Gridinoc, purl.org/net/laur\n\n"}}
