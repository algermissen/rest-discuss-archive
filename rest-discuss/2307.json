I think that&#39;s one of\n&gt; the key reasons many developers (myself included) have such a hard time\n&gt; getting their heads wrapped around REST.  We&#39;re used to Object-Oriented\n&gt; Development, so SOAP/RPC is just a natural extension of that.  We try to\n&gt; use REST and suddenly we are faced with a completely different paradigm,\n&gt; Resource-Oriented Development.\n\nJeff Bone: &quot;It&#39;s a *really attractive*\nproposition to the OOP / IT guys to think of taking an existing object\nmodel and, with no or minimal Web-specific &quot;glue&quot;, simply exporting\nthose interfaces to the Web.&quot;\n\nhttp://www.xent.com/pipermail/fork/2001-August/002801.html\n\n(it&#39;s been an interesting year for REST)\n\nAnyhow, if people can succeed at doing standard OO over the network,\nmore power to them. Why learn REST if you don&#39;t have to. But most of us\nbelieve that just exporting the OO local style to the Web will not work. \n\n * http://www.javatech.dk/javatech2/slides/Jini/img8.html\n\n * http://research.sun.com/techrep/1994/abstract-29.html\n\nInterestingly, there are roughly three main camps in the web services\nworld, RPC, &quot;messaging&quot; (I use scare quotes because the term doesn&#39;t\nseem to be very well defined) and REST. Standard OO (with addressable\nobject interfaces and type-specific interfaces) isn&#39;t really represented\nat all. Procedural, single-endpoint RPC may &quot;seem like&quot; the closest\npattern but its limitations are also the most obvious and severe.\n-- \n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
