In URI design terms, it does.\n\n&gt; is the translation based on human languages ? if so, have you\n&gt; thought about using HTTP headers to decide on the language ? Or\n&gt; do you want each translation to be addressable as a separate\n&gt; resource\n\nWherever I have encountered server-driven language selection in\nthe wild it has only ever annoyed me.\n\nMy preference is always to read content in the language it was\noriginally authored in, unless that is a language I don’t speak\nof course. So I’ll take an English translation of a French page,\nbut if it is available in both English and German I want either\nEnglish or German depending on which one is the original version.\n\nAt other times the different language versions differ\nsignificantly, even though they inform about roughly the same\nthings, in which case I might want to look at several of them.\n\nAlso, if I hit the conference WLAN in Denmark I don’t want to\nhave to fight to get Google in something other than Danish.\n\nEtc etc etc.\n\nConneg for language versions is a neat-sounding idea, but in\npractice there are so many contradictory requirements, edge cases\nand exceptional circumstances as to make it worthless. And where\nit is employed there is frequently no painless way to get the\nactually desired language version.\n\nJust Say No.\n\nMake the different language versions easily, cleanly addressable\nand stick a bunch of flag icons on your page, then call it a day.\nYour users will thank you and you will have less code to write\nand debug.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
