Something\n&gt; simpler than HTTP 1.1 would be more secure.\n\nYou&#39;re confusing abstraction with implementation.  You&#39;re correct in that\nsupporting a full HTTP 1.1 inevitably results in more code than just HTTP 0.9,\nand the probability of security-compromising bugs is proportional to the amount\nof code.  But nobody said a callback service needs to support the full HTTP 1.1\n--- and the MUST part of the spec is a *lot* smaller than the SHOULD and MAY\nparts.  (Though admittedly it is still bigger than 0.9.)\n\nThe point I was trying to make is that the problems you&#39;re talking about have\neverything to do with problems network admins have with inbound connectivity in\ngeneral, regardless of the protocol used.  They&#39;re suspicious of *any*\nrequestable service running on the client machine.  If we&#39;re going to build any\nform of callback that we really believe will get deployed, we&#39;re going to have\nto ignore this concern --- simply supporting a smaller protocol with a smaller,\nverifiable implementation won&#39;t suffice to overcome those fears.\n\njb\n\n\n\n\n"}}
