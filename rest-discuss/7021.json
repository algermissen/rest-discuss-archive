I built a service framework many years ago that made\nit trivally easy to create links that would delete data... oops.)\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The basic idea is solid and sending links around is absolutely one of\n&gt; the greatest benefits afforded a system based on hypermedia...\nIn my opinion, this benefit is not so much about technology, but all\nabout psychology. By removing the fear of what might happen if a\nperson interacts with a web application we enable more users to jump\nin and try that application.\nLet&#39;s pretend somebody came up with a slick way to craft a URI that\ncould be emailed, bookmarked, etc. and that user agents (email,\nbrowsers) knew to use POST or DELETE. Now if the display of the URI\nstill appeared as a blue underlined piece of text, and no\nprompt/warning occured - the end user will not know now which links\nobligate them or do unexpected things. The technology may have been\nworked out, but the user experience (psychology) has been trashed.\n\nIs that part of REST? You decide.\n\n"}}
