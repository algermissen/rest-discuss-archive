But all were agreed that REST itself doesn&#39;t\nsuggest one or the other approach, as long as client code is not\nhard-coded with knowledge of any chosen structure. So it&#39;s just a\nmatter of human understanding. My own preference is for &lt;/sites/&gt;\n(including trailing slash) and &lt;/sites/2&gt; (using the plural), treating\n&quot;sites&quot; as a kind of virtual folder. The implementation approach I use\nlets me differentiate those however I want, so they are separate\n&quot;pages&quot; regardless.\n\nCheers,\nJustin\n\n\nOn 8/1/06, Scott Chapman &lt;scott_list@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; I&#39;m considering making different URL&#39;s for retrieval of a list of sites vs.\n&gt; one site (sites are actual locations on the ground in my scenario):\n&gt;\n&gt; List of sites: http://www.../sites?name1=value1&name2=value2\n&gt; Single site: http://www.../site/2\n&gt;\n&gt; Is this considered Ok for good REST development or should the &quot;sites&quot; (plural)\n&gt; URL be used in all cases?\n&gt;\n&gt; I am considering this because the implementation on the server side would be\n&gt; cleaner, having separate &quot;pages&quot; for list vs. single site returns. I&#39;d like\n&gt; to know what people think of this.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m new to RESTful design. Please let me know what the pro&#39;s and con&#39;s are of\n&gt; doing it this way from a design perspective.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; Scott\n\n"}}
