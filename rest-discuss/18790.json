For instance, search engines could provide\n&gt; an interface for searching through catalogs of HTML documents, where\n&gt; these documents all use the same profile for representing catalog entries.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; mark also noted that he regards a profile mostly as saying something\n&gt; about a representation&#39;s content, such as a metadata profile in HTML,\n&gt; saying that the web page uses dublin core. but even when you look at the\n&gt; dublin core HTML profile (http://dublincore.org/documents/dcq-html/), it\n&gt; also defines conventions about links\n&gt; (http://dublincore.org/documents/dcq-html/#sect-2-4), and not just about\n&gt; non-link data. which is the point i was trying to make saying that the\n&gt; line between &quot;format extensions&quot; and &quot;links&quot; is fuzzy: essentially, a\n&gt; link *is* a format extension, only one that extends beyond the current\n&gt; resource.\n&gt;\n&gt; i am not sure i was able to fully address your concerns, so if you still\n&gt; think i am &quot;redefining&quot; what &#39;profile&#39; is supposed to do, could you be a\n&gt; bit more specific why you think that&#39;s the case, and how you&#39;d like to\n&gt; see it done?\n&gt; ...\n\nMaybe we need to switch to examples to get a clearer picture.\n\nWith &quot;profile&quot; I understand that the link *target* is a URI describing \nthe profile, such as &lt;http://www.w3.org/2006/03/hcard&gt; which describes \nthat hcard profile.\n\nIf you want to use the profile link relation to declare that something \nis a an AtomPub server, on which resource would you set the link relation?\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n"}}
