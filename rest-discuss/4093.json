Imagine two interfaces that\n&gt; the universities *may* =\r\nimplement:\n&gt; \n&gt; (1) http://university.edu/ws/list - returns a list of links=\r\n to each student.\n&gt; (2) http://university.edu/ws/search - accepts a keyword=\r\n and returns a list\n&gt; of links to each student that contains &#39;keyword&#39; in i=\r\nt&#39;s name.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sample response:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;students&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;student link=3D&quot;http:/=\r\n/university.edu/ws/student/001&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;student link=3D&quot;http://university.ed=\r\nu/ws/student/002&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;student link=3D&quot;http://university.edu/ws/student/0=\r\n03&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/students&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Since each university might implement neither, one=\r\n or both interfaces,\n&gt; I would like to define a way for each university to =\r\n&quot;say&quot; which\n&gt; interfaces they implement... something like WSDL, that would =\r\nallow\n&gt; automatic service discovery among universities.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there any s=\r\ntandard way of doing this within the REST arch. style?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advan=\r\nce.\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; S=E9rgio Nunes\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
