I&#39;m sorry if it \n&gt; seems that =\r\nway to you. One of the main inventors of REST is \n&gt; also one of the lead de=\r\nsigners of Apache (Fielding). So \n&gt; surprise, surprise, Apache has REST ide=\r\nas deep down in its \n&gt; core. I see nothing trivial about pointing that out.=\r\n PHP&#39;s \n&gt; developers are strongly influenced by the Apache group, so \n&gt; PHP=\r\n has REST ideas deep down in its core too. etc. etc. for IIS.\n\nWell said. P=\r\nerhaps the problem is that industry is not fully cognizant\nof what it has b=\r\neen building. I&#39;m reminded that many programmers did not\nrealize fully what=\r\n they were doing with OO until the likes of Jim\nCoplien and the GoF articul=\r\nated the idea of Software Patterns.\n\nBill de h=D3ra\n\n..\nPropylon\nwww.propyl=\r\non.com \n\n\n\n"}}
