From [=\r\n1], to whit* (emphasis\n&gt; mine):*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *A REST API should be entered with n=\r\no prior knowledge beyond the initial\n&gt; URI (bookmark) and set of standardiz=\r\ned media types that are appropriate\n&gt; for the intended audience (i.e., expe=\r\ncted to be understood by any client\n&gt; that might use the API). From that po=\r\nint on, all application state\n&gt; transitions must be driven by client select=\r\nion of server-provided choices that\n&gt; are present in the received represent=\r\nations or implied by the user=92s\n&gt; manipulation of those representations. =\r\nThe transitions may be determined\n&gt; (or limited by) the client=92s knowledg=\r\ne of media types and resource\n&gt; communication mechanisms, both of which may=\r\n be improved on-the-fly (e.g.,\n&gt; code-on-demand).*\n&gt; *\n&gt; *\n&gt; *...*\n&gt; *The i=\r\nnterface doesn=92t need to be discovered. It is defined right there\n&gt; in th=\r\ne hypertext. The representation tells the client how to compose all\n&gt; trans=\r\nitions to the next application state. This could be as simple as an\n&gt; ancho=\r\nr or as complex as a java applet. For example, Day=92s CQ5 content\n&gt; manage=\r\nment system allows the user to perform direct image masking and\n&gt; manipulat=\r\nion on the client side and save the filtered image view as a new\n&gt; resource=\r\n, all within the environment of a standard Web browser window.*\n&gt; *\n&gt; *\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n And then from [2]:\n&gt;\n&gt; *Within REST, intermediary components can actively =\r\ntransform the content\n&gt; of messages because the messages are self-descripti=\r\nve and their semantics\n&gt; are visible to intermediaries.*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; So what I&#39;m =\r\ngetting at his is that if your client needs to first download\n&gt; your roadma=\r\np document to know which URLs your individual messages reference\n&gt; then it =\r\nis *stateful* and while it is (probably) hypermedia it seems is\n&gt; not RESTf=\r\nul (because we know that Roy says REST is all or nothing.)  No?\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not=\r\n saying that your approach might not be better than pure REST for\n&gt; your us=\r\ne-case, but the more I try to truly understand REST the more it\n&gt; seems tha=\r\nt *nobody* it really doing APIs that are purely RESTful (yes, I&#39;m\n&gt; using t=\r\nhe superlative &quot;nobody&quot; on purpose.)\n&gt;\n&gt; If nobody&#39;s APIs are actually full=\r\ny RESTful then who&#39;s to say if one\n&gt; person&#39;s tradeoffs are better than ano=\r\nthers?  Until most everyone can agree\n&gt; on what is and is not RESTful it se=\r\nems that too many people are talking\n&gt; past one another and claiming to be =\r\n&quot;*More RESTful than thou&quot;* (note the\n&gt; religious allegory? BTW, I&#39;m not sin=\r\ngling out you with this comment; I mean\n&gt; everyone, including me.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Fran=\r\nkly I wish Roy were interested in jumping into these conversations to\n&gt; cla=\r\nrify for others benefit but I completely respective his evident desire\n&gt; no=\r\nt to spend his time doing so.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Speaking about shared types ... Jimmy B=\r\nogard has a fresh blog post on this\n&gt; issue:\n&gt; http://lostechies.com/jimmyb=\r\nogard/2013/05/01/messages-data-and-types/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks. Also looking for mo=\r\nre stuff like this.\n&gt;\n&gt; Today I would probably have chosen something like J=\r\nSON-home (\n&gt; http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-json-home-02), HAL=\r\n or another\n&gt; hyper media enabled *standard* JSON media type.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nice, I=\r\n will be reading that too.  Good to see Mark&#39;s efforts here; I\n&gt; really do =\r\nthink of him as one of the best web architectures out there.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, no, I =\r\ndo not think using a service document / home page disqualifies\n&gt; the servic=\r\ne as being RESTful - as long as it is used for late binding at\n&gt; runtime (s=\r\nomething which we make quite explicit in the documentation).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Although=\r\n I can see the benefits of a home document my reading of Roy still\n&gt; tells =\r\nme that use of such a home document would not be considered RESTful.\n&gt;  It =\r\nwould be instructive to know what others think especially since we are\n&gt; un=\r\nlikely to hear from Roy on the subject.\n&gt;\n&gt; We have a custom media type &quot;ap=\r\nplication/vendor.cbrain.casefiole+xml&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Cool.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I still have to d=\r\necide whether I prefer generic media types over custom\n&gt; media types - in t=\r\nhis case we chose a custom media type to get some\n&gt; experience. I will writ=\r\ne a piece on that later - when I have made up my\n&gt; mind about what I think =\r\nabout it.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Reading Roy on the subject[1] I think he is clear that medi=\r\na types *must*\n&gt; be non-generic for an API to be RESTful, no? IOW, it&#39;s eff=\r\nectively not\n&gt; possible to use &quot;applications/json&quot; as the specified media t=\r\nype for a web\n&gt; service unless the web service is really, really trivial. A=\r\ngain, from Roy\n&gt; with *my emphasis:*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *In terms of testing a specifica=\r\ntion, the hardest part is identifying\n&gt; when a RESTful protocol is actually=\r\n dependent on out-of-band information or\n&gt; if the authors are just overspec=\r\nifying things for the purpose of\n&gt; documentation. What I look for are requi=\r\nrements on processing behavior that\n&gt; are defined outside of the media type=\r\n specification. One of the easiest\n&gt; ways to see that is when a protocol ca=\r\nlls for the use of a generic media\n&gt; type (like application/xml or applicat=\r\nion/json) and then requires that it\n&gt; be processed in a way that is special=\r\n to the protocol/API. If they are\n&gt; keying off of something unique within t=\r\nhe content (like an XML namespace\n&gt; declaration that extends the semantics =\r\nof a generic type), then it=92s okay.\n&gt; Usually, however, what they do is a=\r\nssume that the response has a specific\n&gt; structure beyond that defined by t=\r\nhe media type. When the structure\n&gt; changes, the client will break.*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nDoesn&#39;t this mean effectively that without a specific media type it cannot\n=\r\n&gt; be RESTful?\n&gt;\n&gt; Also there&#39;s also this from [1]:\n&gt;\n&gt; *The media type is a=\r\n generic processing model that every agent can learn\n&gt; if there aren=92t to=\r\no many of them (hence the need for standards).*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To me that say that R=\r\nEST is most useful for systems that are deployed on a\n&gt; broad scale where m=\r\nany different people/systems are using a common/shared\n&gt; media type, for ex=\r\nample &quot;text/html&quot; or whatever HTML5 calls it these days.\n&gt; :)  Which makes =\r\nme question if all the effort towards building RESTful\n&gt; system in-the-smal=\r\nl is really not missing the point?  Again, from [1]* (emphasis\n&gt; mine):*\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; *REST is software design on the scale of decades: every detail is\n&gt; inten=\r\nded to promote software longevity and independent evolution. Many of\n&gt; the =\r\nconstraints are directly opposed to short-term efficiency.Unfortunately, pe=\r\nople are fairly good at short-term design, and usually\n&gt; awful at long-term=\r\n design. Most don=92t think they need to design past the\n&gt; current release.=\r\n There are more than a few software methodologies that\n&gt; portray any long-t=\r\nerm thinking as wrong-headed, ivory tower design (which\n&gt; it can be if it i=\r\nsn=92t motivated by real requirements).*\n&gt; *\n&gt; *\n&gt;\n&gt; It seems to me the mos=\r\nt useful thing the REST community could do for the\n&gt; web of APIs in general=\r\n is to focus on the establishment of a small number\n&gt; of well-known media t=\r\nypes that can be used within\n&gt; and/or across industries as was implied here=\r\n[3].\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The one thing I still have not been able to fully understand f=\r\nrom Roy&#39;s\n&gt; rant was just exactly what he meant means by a &quot;typed&quot; resource=\r\n?\n&gt;\n&gt; In the case of &lt;img&gt; resources: the shared message contract is the\n&gt; =\r\njpg/gif/... format (media type). There is no shared understanding of the\n&gt; =\r\nserver side data/type from which the image was created.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Ah, that was =\r\nhelpful.

From that point on, a=\r\nll application state transitions must be driven by client selection of serv=\r\ner-provided choices &lt;b&gt;that are present in the received representations&lt;/b&gt;=\r\n or implied by the user=92s manipulation of those representations. The tran=\r\nsitions may be determined (or limited by) the client=92s knowledge of media=\r\n types and resource communication mechanisms, both of which may be improved=\r\n on-the-fly (e.g., code-on-demand).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;te=\r\nxt-align:left;font-family:Georgia,Verdana,Arial,serif&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;text-align:left;font-family:Georgia,Verdana,Arial,s=\r\nerif&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt;&lt;font fac=\r\ne=3D&quot;Georgia, Verdana, Arial, serif&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The interface doesn=92t need to be =\r\ndiscovered. &lt;b&gt;It is defined right there in the hypertext.&lt;/b&gt;=A0The repres=\r\nentation tells the client how to compose &lt;b&gt;all transitions &lt;/b&gt;to the next=\r\n application=A0state.

IOW, it&#39;s effectively not possible to use &qu=\r\not;applications/json&quot; as the specified media type for a web service un=\r\nless the web service is really, really trivial.

What I look for are=\r\n requirements=A0on processing behavior that are defined outside of the medi=\r\na type specification. One of=A0the easiest ways to see that is&lt;b&gt; when a pr=\r\notocol calls for the use of a generic media type=A0(like application/xml or=\r\n application/json) and then requires that it be processed in a way=A0that i=\r\ns special to the protocol/API&lt;/b&gt;. If they are keying off of something uniq=\r\nue within the=A0content (like an XML namespace declaration that extends the=\r\n semantics of a generic=A0type), then it=92s okay. Usually, however, what t=\r\nhey do is assume that=A0the response has a=A0specific structure=A0beyond th=\r\nat defined by the media type. When the structure changes,=A0the client will=\r\n break.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;bloc=\r\nkquote style=3D&quot;margin:0 0 0 40px;border:none;padding:0px&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Doesn&#39;t=\r\n this mean effectively that without a specific media type it cannot be REST=\r\nful?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Also there&#39;s also this from [1]:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;margin:0 0 0 40px;bord=\r\ner:none;padding:0px&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;margin:0 0 0 40px;border:non=\r\ne;padding:0px&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;The media type is a generic processing model that e=\r\nvery agent can learn if there aren=92t=A0too many of them (hence the need f=\r\nor standards).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;margin:0 0 0 40px;border:none;padding:0px&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;To m=\r\ne that say that REST is most useful for systems that are deployed on a broa=\r\nd scale where many different people/systems are using a common/shared media=\r\n type, for example &quot;text/html&quot; or whatever HTML5 calls it these d=\r\nays. :) =A0Which makes me question if all the effort towards building RESTf=\r\nul system in-the-small is really not missing the point? =A0Again, from [1]&lt;=\r\ni&gt;=A0&lt;b&gt;(emphasis mine):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b=\r\nlockquote style=3D&quot;margin:0 0 0 40px;border:none;padding:0px&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockqu=\r\note style=3D&quot;margin:0 0 0 40px;border:none;padding:0px&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;REST is sof=\r\ntware design on the scale of decades: every detail is intended to promote=\r\n=A0software longevity and independent evolution. &lt;b&gt;Many of the constraints=\r\n are directly=A0opposed to short-term efficiency.&lt;/b&gt; Unfortunately, people=\r\n are fairly good at short-term=A0design, and usually awful at long-term des=\r\nign.
