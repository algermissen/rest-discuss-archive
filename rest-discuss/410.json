However,\nyou could also just use a more pipelined smtp\nrelay implementation to get the\nappropriate speed.\n\n&gt; And of course you would need to layer\n&gt; all of HTTP&#39;s semantics on top of SMTP.\n\nNot clear, but I don&#39;t need to argue this.\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
