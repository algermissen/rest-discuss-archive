[...]\n\nMy mis=\r\ntake. Re-reading with emphasis on &quot;unregulated&quot; I now see\nexactly what you =\r\nwere saying.\n\nLooking at Rohit&#39;s &lt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~rohit/&gt; dissertat=\r\nion, he\npresents a number of REST variations, culminating in what he calls\n=\r\nARRESTED - Asynchronous Routed REST with Estimates and Decentralized\nDecisi=\r\nons.\n\n&gt; Push models suffer from a major social problem: those that gain the=\r\n\n&gt; most are the least likely to pay for it.  For example, every news\n&gt; serv=\r\nice thinks that they are the center of the universe.  Consider\n&gt; what would=\r\n happen if every blog client received an event whenever\n&gt; a story was publi=\r\nshed that the news service *thinks* is worthy of\n&gt; their immediate attentio=\r\nn.  We already know what happens: SPAM.\n&gt; To solve the scalability problem =\r\nyou will first need to regulate\n&gt; that social problem, because publishers w=\r\nill not self-regulate.\n\nAgreed: spam is a serious side effect of push model=\r\ns.\n\nIf all SMTP messages had a universal resource identifier then perhaps\ns=\r\npam problems could be mitigated more effectively? For example,\nimagine if S=\r\nMTP messages were restricted so that they contain only the\nequivalent of an=\r\n HTTP &quot;302 Found&quot; response. The message itself is not\nallowed to contain an=\r\ny content, only a Location header describing\nwhere to GET the content. Beca=\r\nuse the GET requires the information\nsource to positively identify itself b=\r\ny means of a Location/URI, there\nis some protection there. The value propos=\r\nition for spammers goes\ndown: while they can still send messages, they can&#39;=\r\nt deliver *content*\nanonymously. A recipient that has never subscribed to t=\r\nhat URI can\nsimply discard it without retrieving the content; or check the =\r\nURI\nagainst a spam registry prior to downloading content; etc.\n\nThe presenc=\r\ne subscription approach used in instant messaging systems\nalso seems to be =\r\na fairly effective way of managing the social\nproblem. By forcing publisher=\r\ns to gain a presence subscription prior\nto letting any of their messages th=\r\nrough, you take away much of the\nvalue of sending unsolicited messages. If =\r\nSMTP required the use of\nURIs to retrieve content, then email clients could=\r\n also support\nsubscription-like capabilities.\n\n&gt; [...] I would not start wi=\r\nth REST as the basis.\n\nYes, but this is REST-Discuss, where REST is at the =\r\ncenter of the world.  :)\n\n--Jeoff Wilks\n\n"}}
