If you put extensions=\r\n in, to *any media type*,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; via either\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; new markup or even changin=\r\ng the meaning of standard atom\n&gt; &gt;&gt; markup, you\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; should change media =\r\ntypes, because it is the media type\n&gt; &gt;&gt; which names /\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; describes the=\r\n preferred semantics of the message, and it is the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; message metadata=\r\n which is the most authoritative on the web:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; That&#39;s not the case.=\r\n It may well be the case for some - text/plain \n&gt; &gt;&gt; comes to mind - but th=\r\ne majority of widely used media types are \n&gt; &gt;&gt; designed well enough to acc=\r\nommodate non-breaking extensions (where \n&gt; &gt;&gt; their introduction doesn&#39;t af=\r\nfect the meaning of the core content).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; IOW when served with that me=\r\ndia type messages are \n&gt; understood as that \n&gt; &gt; media type.\n&gt; \n&gt; Right.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;  If a client/processor is looking for the extended \n&gt; semantics how do=\r\nes \n&gt; &gt; it request them?\n&gt; \n&gt; It doesn&#39;t, in general. If the extensions are=\r\n standardized \n&gt; and have value to the publisher (usually determined by the=\r\n \n&gt; quantity/quality of consumers), then the publisher will \n&gt; probably jus=\r\nt provide them for everybody since they&#39;re not \n&gt; interested in dealing wit=\r\nh the complexity of customizing \n&gt; responses for the specific needs of each=\r\n client (again, in general).\n\nThe key point here is _standardized_, and the=\r\n scope of that standardization.\nIf my API documents\na parameter for a media=\r\n type, it is standardized within my API and the scope of that\nstandard is m=\r\ny API.  Clients exchange and know about the media type\nby building to my AP=\r\nI.\n\nHow does a client developer rely on an extension which is not registere=\r\nd\nwith the mime type standardization tree.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; That said, th=\r\nere&#39;s some ambiguity here with regards to \n&gt; when it makes \n&gt; &gt;&gt; sense to u=\r\nse a different (or new) media type. An SVG \n&gt; document wrapped \n&gt; &gt;&gt; in &quot;&lt;h=\r\ntml&gt;&lt;body&gt;&quot; wouldn&#39;t be very useful served with the \n&gt; text/html \n&gt; &gt;&gt; medi=\r\na type, for example.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ??: http://www.w3schools.com/html5/html5_svg.a=\r\nsp\n&gt; \n&gt; Huh. Well, that example served me much better 10 years ago \n&gt; befor=\r\ne compound document features percolated to the \n&gt; mainstream.\n\nWell this is=\r\n an example of an evolving media type I guess.  But it is\ndocumented, and t=\r\next/html is currently understood to include historically\nsvg content (or co=\r\nntent that looks a lot like svg, anyway).\n\nBrowsers have evolved along with=\r\n the media type.\n\n&gt; Though the point remains for the moment, as I \n&gt; doubt =\r\nall SVG clients are HTML5-enabled in this way,\n\nShouldn&#39;t that be the other=\r\n way round?  html clients being svg enabled?\nI too doubt any svg clients ar=\r\ne html enabled in this way.\n\n&gt; meaning \n&gt; that as an SVG publisher (and tha=\r\nt sample document is, for \n&gt; all intents and purposes, SVG) I should still =\r\nbe using image/svg+xml.\n\nIt is the html media type that is swallowing svg i=\r\nn this case.  I don&#39;t\nknow why they are doing this, but doubtless have some=\r\n good reason.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; But an\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Atom document with a single entry e=\r\nxtension from a foreign \n&gt; namespace \n&gt; &gt;&gt; is still an Atom document becaus=\r\ne the spec specifically \n&gt; accommodates \n&gt; &gt;&gt; such an extension; it should =\r\nuse application/atom+xml.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I agree that it _can_ use application/ato=\r\nm+xml, but in \n&gt; order to convey \n&gt; &gt; extended semantics, paging for exampl=\r\ne, it would need to use a \n&gt; &gt; different media type, application/atom+xml;t=\r\nype=3Dfeed in the paging \n&gt; &gt; case.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s the same media type; applic=\r\nation/atom+xml in both \n&gt; cases. The use of a media-type-specific parameter=\r\n doesn&#39;t \n&gt; change the type. \n\nNo its not the same type it is a new type bu=\r\nt if you don&#39;t understand\nthe parameter you should ignore it.  I am not \nan=\r\n authority on media types and it is a subtle art from what I see.\n\nFor exam=\r\nple, the fallback behaviour RFC 3023 suggested for &#39;+xml&#39; \nwhich has become=\r\n de facto practice in other registrations, had \nalready been built into MIM=\r\nE via parameters.  And I&#39;ve\nnever seen a processor which didn&#39;t understand =\r\na */something+xml type\nfallback to the */xml semantics.  I&#39;d like to see th=\r\nat, if someone\nis aware of such.\n\n&gt; IIRC, James Snell wanted a separate med=\r\nia \n&gt; type for Atom feeds vs. entries and I came up with the \n&gt; compromise =\r\nof the type parameter just so it could be safely \n&gt; ignored in this way (or=\r\n perhaps somebody came up with it and \n&gt; I supported it, not sure).\n\nOK, th=\r\nat&#39;s the history, thanks for that.  Good to know.  I would say\nit worked ou=\r\nt well, since the type parameter _can_ be used to\ndistinguish an atompub se=\r\nrvice, right?  IOW, if receive\na type parameter in the Content-Type, you kn=\r\now for sure the server\nis at least aware of RFC 5023.\n\nAnd if a client requ=\r\nests application/atom+xml;type=3Dfeed the server\n(implementor) should reali=\r\nze that the client implementor is aware of\nRFC 5023 and may be able to make=\r\n good use of app:collection and\nlink@rel=3D&quot;next&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; In betwe=\r\nen those two extremes, the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; decision depends upon the specifics of the =\r\nextensibility \n&gt; features of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; type(s) in play, the importance=\r\n and quantity of extended vs.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; core content.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t think its =\r\na question of quantity, more of importance.  And \n&gt; &gt; importance is subject=\r\nive.\n&gt; \n&gt; Agreed, but IME, there&#39;s usually a correlation with quantity.\n\n\n\n=\r\n\nI don&#39;t know.  If you override the meaning of an attribute in atom,\ncan it=\r\n still be safely processed as atom?  I know, you&#39;re going to \nsay, depends =\r\non which attribute.  I&#39;m not as strict in what I do \nas in what I tell othe=\r\nrs to do ;-).  Just trying to think it through!\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  If the extende=\r\nd semantics is important to a client, it will be \n&gt; &gt; requested, with Accep=\r\nt:.  If not, it won&#39;t. But if the extended \n&gt; &gt; semantics is just served wi=\r\nth no signals for desire or of delivery, \n&gt; &gt; and clients actually do end u=\r\np using the extended \n&gt; semantics, that is \n&gt; &gt; out-of-band coupling of the=\r\n nth degree IMHO.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Only the publisher knows what the content m=\r\neans, so they get to \n&gt; &gt;&gt; decide which media type to use.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I believ=\r\ne that it is the published definition of the media \n&gt; type which \n&gt; &gt; is im=\r\nportant, not the content.  A jpeg of my cat is not the same \n&gt; &gt; content as=\r\n a jpeg of a supernova, but they both may have \n&gt; the same media type defin=\r\nition.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On the application tree,  application/json or \n&gt; application=\r\n/xml would be \n&gt; &gt; sufficient for almost everything.  But they aren&#39;t, so w=\r\ne \n&gt; invent new \n&gt; &gt; media subtypes to describe the markup.  Atom is one, b=\r\nut I \n&gt; don&#39;t think \n&gt; &gt; it stops there, not by a long shot.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, tho=\r\nse two types aren&#39;t sufficient, but for different \n&gt; reasons than what I th=\r\nink you&#39;re talking about (search the \n&gt; archives for\n&gt; application/xml)\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Media types are not a type system of arbitrary granularity \n&gt; for your ap=\r\nplication, just a simple, very coarse-grained way \n&gt; to associate some cont=\r\nent with a specification for its \n&gt; interpretation. You can of course defin=\r\ne them as granular as \n&gt; you like, but the less general they are, the less =\r\nappealing \n&gt; they are to support.\n\nAgain, I&#39;m not sure. I think media type =\r\ndesign can scale, from my API\nto the Web.  Not everyone on the Web will wan=\r\nt to support my API,\nbut that&#39;s ok, too.\n\nThanks for the good conversation!=\r\n\n\nPeter\n\n"}}
