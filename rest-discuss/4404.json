On the other hand, with the Java servlet API I never ever\n&gt;&gt;had any problem implementing handlers for PUT, so it&#39;s definitively not\n&gt;&gt;&quot;fancy&quot; from my point of view. Nor are OPTIONS, PROPFIND, PROPPATCH or\n&gt;&gt;other new HTTP methods.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not going to argue abut the premise.  I asked in another thread\n&gt; whether there were people interested in a rest-dev kind of list and\n&gt; consensus was for using rest-discuss, but now in actually doing that I&#39;m\n&gt; having to defend the concept.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m outta here.  Go back to how many angels fit on the head of a pin.\n\nCan&#39;t follow. You&#39;ll have to accept the fact that people will start to \nask questions if what you write things they don&#39;t be understand. It&#39;s \nnot anybody&#39;s fault; it&#39;s just how mailing lists work.\n\nAnyway, why would you want to encode a PUT request body? Still wondering...\n\n\nBest regards, Julian\n\n-- \n&lt;green/&gt;bytes GmbH -- http://www.greenbytes.de -- tel:+492512807760\n\n"}}
