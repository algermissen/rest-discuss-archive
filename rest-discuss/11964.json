So I’ll take an English translation of a French page,\n&gt; but if it is available in both English and German I want either\n&gt; English or German depending on which one is the original version.\n\nThis isn&#39;t a choice of language per se, it&#39;s a choice of original \nversion over translation.\n\n&quot;en&quot; is a choice of language, &quot;original version&quot; is not.\n\n&gt; At other times the different language versions differ\n&gt; significantly, even though they inform about roughly the same\n&gt; things, in which case I might want to look at several of them.\n\nReading several translations of something is a different task to reading \nsomething without thinking or caring about whether or not it has other \ntranslations out there. As a different task for the user, it has \ndifferent requirements for the tech.\n\n&gt; Also, if I hit the conference WLAN in Denmark I don’t want to\n&gt; have to fight to get Google in something other than Danish.\n\nThe problem with Google is that while it does language con-neg it does \nGeo IP first.\n\nGoogle.com handles language fine once you can convince it to let you \nactually go to google.com. Alas, from Denmark it likes to redirect you \nto google.dk where language con-neg isn&#39;t done.\n\nNot a language con-neg problem, quite the opposite.\n\n&gt; Conneg for language versions is a neat-sounding idea, but in\n&gt; practice there are so many contradictory requirements, edge cases\n&gt; and exceptional circumstances as to make it worthless. And where\n&gt; it is employed there is frequently no painless way to get the\n&gt; actually desired language version.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just Say No.\n\nHow do I work out whether to say No, Non, Nien, Nej, Ne or use Irish \n(which lacking an exact translation for &quot;no&quot; makes for a more involved \ntranslation.\n\n&gt; Make the different language versions easily, cleanly addressable\n&gt; and stick a bunch of flag icons on your page, then call it a day.\n\nThe mapping between flags and languages harmless in some cases, but in \nother debated with AK-47s, pipe bombs the torturing of people imprisoned \nwithout trial and so on. In this regard at least, it doesn&#39;t scale.\n\n\n"}}
