That\n&gt;&gt; could mean SOAP, XML-RPC, or [proprietary] POX.\n&gt; \n&gt; I like to use these definitions:\n&gt; \n&gt; WEB SITE: a collection of interlinked Web pages accessible by a\n&gt; Web browser\n&gt; \n&gt; WEB APPLICATION: a dynamically-generated, interactive Web site\n&gt; \n&gt; WEB SERVICE: a machine-understandable Web application\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Put another way: don&#39;t give up now on using a simple term like\n&gt;&gt; &quot;web services&quot; for a simple idea like REST. Repetition is the\n&gt;&gt; way to transform language, and &quot;web services&quot; almost has all the\n&gt;&gt; SOAP rinsed out of it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nicely put. :)\n\nHas Justin pointed out, Web Site, Web Application and Web Service are \nthree different type of &quot;applications&quot; for the Web. The notion of Web \nArchitecture is larger than (and actually transversal to) the notion of \nWeb Service. Let&#39;s not reduce REST to Web Services otherwise we&#39;ll get \ncompared to SOAP and RPC forever. IMO, REST is much more universal than \ntha. As an architecture style, it applies to any Web program (client \napps like browsers, proxies, etc).\n\nThere seems to be space for a new term to help us communicate our ideas \n(REST, straight XML, HTTP compliance, etc.). We could simply use Web \nArchitecture, but the proposed Web Oriented Architecture (WOA) has the \nadvantage of being easier to communicate (with its acronym) to \nnon-technical or non REST-expert people. It also has some phonetic and \nvisual similarities with SOA which might help people to more easily \nguess what is the proposition behind.\n\n-- \nJerome Louvel\nhttp://www.restlet.org\n\n\n"}}
