The answer is not clear to me from reading the spec. \nCurrently I understand it as:\n\nServer issues 401 Unauthorized challenge.\nClient generates a Digest header to authenticate itself.\n\nMy question is: is the client expected to include the Digest HTTP \nheader in all further requests to the server? Or is the server \nsupposed to magically remember that this client has already \nauthenticated itself?\n\nI suspect that a client should be forced to reauthenticate itself \nwith every request and this is how most browsers seem to work but I&#39;m \nnot completely sure. Thanks for the input.\n\n- Buko\n\n\n"}}
