E.g.=\r\n,:\n\nhttp://example.com/search?query=3Datom+or+rss+syndication&type=3Darticl=\r\ne &#92;\n&collection=3Dmy_collection&collection=3Dyour_collection&start=3D10&max=\r\n=3D40\n\nI take that url string and &quot;normalize&quot; it (lower-case all query term=\r\ns,\nalphabetize multiple params, etc) into a data structure such that all\neq=\r\nuivalent searches will result in the exact same data structure (NOTE\nthat &#39;=\r\nstart&#39; and &#39;max&#39; are NOT included in the data structure).  I\nthen get the m=\r\nd5 hash of the string representation of that data\nstructure -- this will se=\r\nrve as a key to a cache of searches.  I then\nderive an sql statement from t=\r\nhe data structure and perform the\nsearch.  The result of the search is simp=\r\nly a set of ordered ID\nnumbers for all of the items that match the search. =\r\n I take that\nentire id number string and cache it, with the search md5 hash=\r\n as the\nkey.  Next, I apply the &quot;start&quot; and &quot;max&quot; parameters to this string=\r\n,\nresulting in my viewable set of items,. which I load up (i.e., grab\nall o=\r\nf the data for these items) and send back in the response.  Note\nthat the o=\r\nriginal search query is &quot;bookmark-able&quot; and will always\nreturn the same res=\r\nponse.\n\nEmbedded in the response are links to the &quot;previous&quot; and &quot;next&quot; set=\r\n of\nitems (computed based on the &quot;start&quot; and &quot;max&quot; params of the original\nr=\r\nequest).  BUT, instead of embedding that entire query string, I can\nsimply =\r\nembed a URL like:\n\nhttp://example.com/search_hash/56YYYufgsfggfccFF098?star=\r\nt=3D50&max=3D40\n\nfor the &quot;next&quot; link.\n\nWell, I appear to have used a GET re=\r\nquest to create a new resource in\nthe search_hash resource &#39;collection&#39;, wh=\r\nich I now refer to in the\nresulting hypertext of that new search.  Should t=\r\nhe original query\nhave used POST instead of GET?  (That seems wrong somehow=\r\n, and in the\ncase of repeat searches it WON&#39;T create a new resource, but us=\r\ning GET\nis CLEARLY resulting in a &#39;side effect&#39;, which in not allowed).\n\nan=\r\ny advice/observations on this?\n\nmany thanks-\nPeter Keane\ndaseproject.org\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
