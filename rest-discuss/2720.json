Essentially, reverse the roles of client and server.\n&gt; &gt; With HTTP, this means putting a port 80 listener on the client and\nhandling\n&gt; &gt; PUT or POST.\n&gt;\n&gt; I actually am considering this for aspects of the system that do not\nrequire\n&gt; near real-time notification.  For the real-time stuff though my concern is\n&gt; with\n&gt; scalability.  As the number of clients grow, the publisher would end\n&gt; up POSTing (synchronously) to large numbers of clients.  Even if I were\n&gt; to spin up a bunch of threads to handle this, there could be an\nintolerable\n&gt; lag waiting for responses.\nThe POST to multiple clients can happen on one thread if you build it right.\nYou just need asynch IO.\nYou POST to client 1, then POST to client 2, etc. then check for response\nfrom client 1 - process it if there, then go on to client 2, etc. With a\nsmall thread pool, you could do this reasonably easy. With Java&#39;s new NIO,\nyou probably could do it in Java also.\n\nAlso, what about a cascade of machines?\n\n\n&gt; I started to read some of the documentation on the KnowNow.com site, but\n&gt; for some reason I haven&#39;t been able to connect to it for a while,  So\n&gt; I may be missing something, but they seemed to indicate that they had\n&gt; some mechanism for doing HTTP POST asynchronously, that is, without\n&gt; waiting for a response.  If true, that seems like an abuse of HTTP. Why\n&gt; not just choose a protocol that is built to be asynchronous?\nThats fine too - you don&#39;t lose any REST concepts, but you may have to build\nup some HTTP concepts.\n\n&gt; I&#39;d prefer to stick will well supported standards-based tools if possible.\n&gt;\n&gt; This seems like a class of problem not well suited for REST - the\n&gt; client-server\n&gt; aspect of it anyway; I&#39;ll still try to maintain a generic interface, etc.\nREST works fine - HTTP may have issues.\n\n\n"}}
