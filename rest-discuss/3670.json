You say that they  \ncannot share a common URI, but appear to list that as option #1. It&#39;s  \nalso unclear whether you just want user-agent caching or shared caching  \n(e.g., in proxies); I&#39;ll assume the latter.\n\nIf that&#39;s the case, I&#39;d recommend option #1 with\n   Cache-Control: public, must-revalidate, max-age=0\nThis allows a cache to keep a copy of the representation, but forces it  \nto validate each request on the origin server, thereby maintaining  \naccess control. (BTW, I would not recommend using no-cache, as some  \nimplementations may still incorrectly interpret this as having the  \nsemantics of no-store).\n\nA few years back, I did a deployment of an authenticated document  \ncaching system for Merrill Lynch using this technique with both open  \nsource and commercial proxy caches, and it worked flawlessly.\n\nA more efficient approach would be to cache the authentication state on  \nintermediaries, rather than just the representations; this would allow  \nthem to avoid the round-trip back to the origin server every time. I  \nwrote up an Internet-Draft [1] about this a while back, but the major  \ndrawback is that it won&#39;t work with Digest authentication. I don&#39;t know  \nof any implementations.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n1.  http://www.mnot.net/papers/draft-nottingham-http-auth-cache-00.txt\n\n\nOn Thursday, May 8, 2003, at 11:06 PM, Tyler Close wrote:\n\n&gt; On Thursday 08 May 2003 21:43, Seairth Jacobs wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Which would be the best way to ensure cachability of a resource where  \n&gt;&gt; a\n&gt;&gt; limited set of individuals require access, but cannot share a common  \n&gt;&gt; URI.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 1) Assign a user/pwd pair and a single URL.  In this case, the  \n&gt;&gt; user/pwd is\n&gt;&gt; little more than a nonce.\n&gt;&gt; 2) Generate a unique URL for each individual (likely by adding a  \n&gt;&gt; nonce to\n&gt;&gt; the end of the path), then use the &quot;Content-Location:&quot; header with a\n&gt;&gt; single, global URL value.\n&gt;&gt; 3) Other thoughts?\n&gt;\n&gt; If a resource is subject to access control, representations must\n&gt; be transferred over an encrypted communications channel, such as\n&gt; is provided by HTTPS. If HTTPS is used, there will be no shared\n&gt; cache. In this case, the only relevant cache is the client&#39;s\n&gt; personal cache. The client&#39;s personal cache can be keyed off the\n&gt; client&#39;s personal URI. This makes option 2 the best choice, with\n&gt; no need for setting a global &quot;Content-Location&quot; header.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tyler\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
