Joe Gregorio&#39;s articles on XML.com are still the \n&gt; *only* thing to date I&#39;ve seen that approaches practicality, and \n&gt; believe me I&#39;ve searched for practical examples. But maybe you&#39;ll say \n&gt; practicality isn&#39;t goal, but then what good is something that has no \n&gt; practical use (without getting philisophical, of\n&gt; course?)\n\nThis is just not so. I wrote an article for onlamp about REST and AJAX.\n\nI *know* that other people have written similarly good articles (Prescod&#39;s\nstuff is good, as previously stated). You&#39;re not looking hard enough.\n\nYou&#39;re point about implementation details is a good one - we need more and\nmore articles explaining how to do something (say content\nnegotiation) and why we do it RESTfully and why that&#39;s better than any other\nway.\n\n\nBut we&#39;re not going to get those articles by arguing about singular vs\nplural here.\n\nYou should pick singular or plural and then let somebody change your mind\nlater if they feel strongly about it.\n\n--\nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n\n"}}
