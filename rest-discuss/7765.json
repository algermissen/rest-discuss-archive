What could be the\nbehaviour =\r\nof the server ?\nHere is an excerpt of the HTTP rfc 2616 :\nIf none of the en=\r\ntity tags match, or if &quot;*&quot; is given and no current\nentity exists, the serve=\r\nr MUST NOT perform the requested method&quot;.\n\nIt could be understood in 2 ways=\r\n :\n - PUT the new representation because &quot;*&quot; has not been given\n - send 412=\r\n status because &quot;If none of the entity tags match&quot; may say\nthat effectively=\r\n the &quot;A&quot; entity tag has been matched.\n\nBest regards,\nThierry Boileau \n\n\n"}}
