YMMV.\n\nI&#39;ve found it&#39;s a valuable means to explain REST to people with an  \nRPC/Web services background: in a WS-* scenario, you have a fixed  \nnumber of &quot;endpoint&quot; URLs, a variable number of data formats, and a  \nvariable number of interfaces. In REST, you have n resource URLs, n  \ndata formats, and a fixed number (i.e., 1) interface. It just helps  \nto explain that there is nothing you can express using a WS/RPC  \napproach that you can&#39;t express with a RESTful architecture as well -  \nyou just vary two of three parameters in both cases.\n\nI&#39;m aware of the fact that it&#39;s not really correct (as resource URLs  \nare not supposed to identify &quot;command processors&quot;), but it serves its  \npurpose.\n\nStefan\n--\nStefan Tilkov, http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
