Consider the\nconcepts &#39;the 1st Amendment of the US Constitution&#39; and &#39;the 2nd Amendment\nof the US Constitution&#39;: it is likely that URIs like\n\n          \n          http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html#Am2\n\nwill be used as identifiers for them.\n\nI am wondering how to make use of the structure of the document\ncurrently living at http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html and\nto adhere to the Web principles at the same time.\n\nSuppose I am the authority that owns http://www.usconstitution.net and\nI want to publish names (URIs) for the (concepts of the) amendments of\nthe US constitution to enable users or semantc web technologies to\nmake statements about these concepts. Do you think it would be a good\nsolution to publish URIs such as\n\n          \n          http://www.usconstitution.net/constitution/amendments/1\n          http://www.usconstitution.net/constitution/amendments/2\n\nand to set up a system on the server that would use const.html and\nmaybe XSLT transformations to resolve these URIs to representations\nthat contain the corresponding sections extracted from the large HTML\ndocument?\n\nWhat about the idea to include links to /const.html#Am1 and /const.html#Am2\nin these representations to let humans view the amendment &#39;in context&#39;?\n\n\n\nWithin the Topic Maps community the whole issue of fragment identifiers\nand URIs that are indended as names isn&#39;t yet recognized and we (the community)\nare actually promoting this as some sort of &#39;best practice&#39; or &#39;this is\nhow you do it&#39;. (see for example [1]).\n\nI&#39;d really like to come up with a technical solution that enables URI publishing\nauthorities to use URIs without fragment identifiers but at the same time to\nuse the internal structure of their documents to return representations that\nlet humans understand what the published URIs are names for.\n\nAny thoughts about this are very welcome.\n\nJan\n\n\n[1] http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tm-pubsubj/\n[2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2003Jan/0148.html\n\n\n-- \nJan Algermissen                           http://www.topicmapping.com\nConsultant & Programmer\t                  http://www.gooseworks.org\n\n"}}
