There will be a gradual transition towards increasingly more\nsemantic-rich vocabularies.  \n\n2. At the present we are in the &quot;vanilla XML phase&quot;.  The emphasis today\nis on getting consensus within a community on what is the required data\nand how it should be organized.  Web services move away from exchanging\nHTML documents to exchanging XML documents.  \n\n   - THIS IS A HUGE LEAP FORWARD!  Do not underestimate the impact \n     of this change! It positions the Web for the next stage - \n     introducing semantics into the Web.\n\n2. Starting around 2005 you will start to see the introduction of\nnon-vanilla XML vocabularies.  These vocabularies will enable\ninferencing (e.g., discover that SLR is a camera), thus enabling dynamic\ndiscovery.  There will likewise be a shift in how Web services are\ndescribed - from a textual (HTML) description to a semantic-discoverable\ndescription.  The leading contender today is DAML-S. (During this phase\nI would expect to see implemented Seth&#39;s idea of blending human-readable\nWeb service descriptions with machine-readable descriptions)\n\n3. The full semantic Web kicks in around 2007.\n\n----\n\nPositioning for the future\n\nWant to get your company in a good position for the future?  Concentrate\non:\n   - getting consensus within your community on an XML vocabulary\n   - get your applications onto the Web\n   - get your applications to stop exchanging HTML documents and\n     start exchanging XML documents\n   - describe your Web services textually using HTML\n   - use standard search engines (Google, Yahoo, etc) to locate\n     services.\n\nIf you do these things then you are:\n   - working efficiently\n   - not wasting money (on things like SOAP, WSDL, UDDI; note in the\n     timeline no mention of these; when the dust settles on these\n     technologies superior technologies - DAML, DAML-S - will have\n     already superceded them)\n   - you are positioning your company for the next step\n\nThese time estimates are based upon my observation of the speed of W3\ntechnologies being developed and deployed on the Web.\n\nComments?  /Roger\n\n\n"}}
