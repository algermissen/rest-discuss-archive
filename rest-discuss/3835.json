An error response describes the specifics of the\nerror, leaving the client no way to proceed through the application,\nexcept to do a logical &quot;Back&quot;; as far as the state of the application is\nconcerned (which the client maintains), that interaction never happened.\n\n&gt; Also, in general, where did I get the impression that an application\n&gt; unsure about specific status codes can/should punt and use the x00\n&gt; in the appropriate category?  Doesn&#39;t seem to say that in 2616 for\n&gt; the 400 family.\n\nSec 6.1.1;\n\n&quot;HTTP status codes are extensible. HTTP applications are not required\n to understand the meaning of all registered status codes, though such\n understanding is obviously desirable. However, applications MUST\n understand the class of any status code, as indicated by the first\n digit, and treat any unrecognized response as being equivalent to the\n x00 status code of that class, with the exception that an\n unrecognized response MUST NOT be cached.&quot;\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
