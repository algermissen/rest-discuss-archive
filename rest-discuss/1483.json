The client knows what context they received that\n&gt; link in so most likely knows what it refers to but the server has lost that\n&gt; context (being stateless and all). Path information can really help the\n&gt; server out here while still not breaking the REST guidelines (I hope).\n\nI agree. I was defending your design.
