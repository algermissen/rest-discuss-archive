Alexander Jacobson wrote:\n\n&gt;cookie-based and HTTP auth are identical when the\n&gt;client is software.  The only difference is the\n&gt;name of the HTTP header in which the\n&gt;authentication token is passed.  But really the\n&gt;whole premise of HTTP auth is unreasonable for\n&gt;automated clients.  Clients just send a secret\n&gt;token.  They don&#39;t need a mnemonic separating\n&gt;usernames from passwords.\n&gt;\n&gt;For human users, the login form that comes in the\n&gt;401 response is as visible as you want.  In\n&gt;practice Mozilla appears to auto-fill most login\n&gt;forms I reach correctly and without issue which\n&gt;makes me think that visibility is a non-issue.\n&gt;\n&gt;-Alex-\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nHmmm.  I thought visibility was about the ability of \ncomponents/intermediaries to understand the meaning of the message.  \nI.e., a proxy can&#39;t tell whether or not a cookie contains auth info \nsince it doesnt know the syntax of what&#39;s been packed in the cookie.  \nHowever, it does know what the HTTP auth header means, and thus knows \nwhat it can or cant do with the message (and its response).  (This all \nmay be moot as far as auth headers and cookies go since I think many \nproxies wont cache things with cookies in them).\n\n--Chuck\n\n&gt;On Thu, 24 Jul 2003, Chuck Hinson wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Alex Jacobson wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;--On Wednesday, July 23, 2003 2:53 PM -0700 &quot;Roy T.
