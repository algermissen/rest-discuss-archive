Mike Dierken&quot; wrote:\n&gt; As I was thinking about whether long-lived transactions can be done \nwith\n&gt; HTTP or not - from that message with DonB&#39;s comments - I thought of \nsome\n&gt; ideas that may help communicate the ideas behind REST.\n\nMike, these are really interesting ideas.  Your ideas and mine are \ngetting much close to convergence.  I&#39;ll try some tweaks below and \nsee if we can do a complete mind meld.\n\n&gt; A business protocol - like sending and receiving purchase orders and\n&gt; invoices - looks like a really simple thing to do with HTTP. You \njust send\n&gt; the purchase order in a request and get the purchase order \nacknowledgement\n&gt; in the response. \n\nThe business protocol for purchase orders is Offer-Acceptance.\nSending and receiving is only the beginning of the business protocol.\nA purchase order is an offer to buy.  You do want to get a receipt \nacknowledgment, but the receipt acknowledgment may or may not \nconstitute formal acceptance.  Thus the discussions we&#39;ve had on this \nlist about acceptance as a separate-but-related possibly much later \ninteraction.\n\nWhen you send a PO in a request and get a receipt ack in the \nresponse, the PO resource is in the &quot;Offered&quot; state, but most likely \nnot yet in the &quot;Accepted&quot; state.\n\n&gt; The problem with this is that the idea that you are sending\n&gt; documents with HTTP is incorrect. A /messaging/ protocol would be\n&gt; appropriate to send documents with. For HTTP, what you are sending \nare\n&gt; messages /about a resource/.\n&gt; A business protocol is an abstract conceptual thing - with concepts \nlike\n&gt; purchase order, invoice, etc. \n\nThis is a really important insight.  \nA purchase order is an economic contract.\nEach purchase order line item represents two or more economic \ncommitments:  usually a commitment from one party to deliver some \ngoods or services, and a commitment from the other party to pay for \nthem.\n\nIn a negotiation situation, there could be several messages or \ndocuments-sent-over-the-wire involved in coming to agreement on those \ncommitments.  The resource would represent the current states of \nthose commitments - although the audit trail of documents sent over \nthe wire could also be saved as dependent resources.\n\n&gt; When you use HTTP to implement business protocols, the messages you \nsend\n&gt; will be about resources that you and your partners have agreed are \nnecessary\n&gt; in order to conduct business. The HTTP message will be /about/ a \npurchase\n&gt; order, it won&#39;t /be/ a purchase order.\n\nYes! Excellent!\nI think of each message as a speech act in a conversation about an \neconomic exchange.  The speech acts may change the states of \nresources involved in the exchange.\nThe economic exchange conversation has stages, for example:\n* agreeing on commitments - promises to deliver goods and services \nand to pay for them;\n* delivering the goods or services and payments and agreeing that the \ncommitments were fulfilled (or not).\n\n&gt; Rather than describe who sends what\n&gt; and when, an HTTP based business protocol would describe what \ndocuments (and\n&gt; other pieces) are resources and who is responsible for creating \nthem and\n&gt; what operations are legal at certain points in the transaction. \n\nI think the preceding statement needs some rewording, but the idea is \ncorrect.  &quot;Legality&quot; and &quot;certain points&quot; would best be defined in \nterms of states of resources involved in the economic exchange.\nFor example, don&#39;t deliver the goods if the order is in the Rejected \nstate.  Or, you can&#39;t cancel the order if the goods have been shipped.\n\n&gt; Anyway... just some thoughts.\n\nGood ones!  Thanks,\nBob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
