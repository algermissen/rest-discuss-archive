Rails=\r\n is currently busted from a REST viewpoint\n&gt; - it&#39;s conventions are at odds=\r\n with sound web design, and it&#39;s about\n&gt; time, frankly. I&#39;m not holding out=\r\n for retraction on that community&#39;s\n&gt; stance on technologies like GWA, but =\r\nyou never know.\n\nDitto.  Good to see.\n\nI&#39;m also mildy concerned about the u=\r\nse of &quot;CRUD&quot;, because as Jerome\nsays, the mapping to uniform operations isn=\r\n&#39;t one-to-one.  Labels have\na way of taking on a life of their own if you&#39;r=\r\ne not careful, so this\ncould come back to haunt the community.  But DHH see=\r\nms to understand\nthe difference so hopefully the Rails APIs don&#39;t misrepres=\r\nent the\nuniform interface.\n\nFWIW, CRUD was used a few years ago by Web serv=\r\nices proponents to\ndescribe REST interfaces and (from my POV) implicitly pu=\r\nt it down.\nSome of us pushed back and it seemed to die out though, but it w=\r\nas odd\nto see it make a comeback as a *pro*-REST label.\n\nMark.\n\n"}}
