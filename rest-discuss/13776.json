I know one may simply use some HTTP client and work  \nfrom there. However, I tend to see this practice as being quite  \ntedious. In the SOAP/WSDL world, for instance, there&#39;s code  \ngeneration. Though many of you would hate that (and it&#39;s  \nunderstandable why), perhaps in the REST world, there is one that  \nautomatically reads the proper hyperlinks we give them on some parts  \nof the resource representations provided in some URL. Of course, all  \nthis is done dynamically. Given one thing to do for instance, this  \nclient would go from some URL (perhaps &#39;/&#39; of the site), then follow  \nsome link from there and so on. Of course, should the server advice  \nthe client to cache the response, it would do so accordingly. Again,  \ndoing all these by hand may seem tedious.\n\nFYI though, from the server perspective, I see webmachine (http://bitbucket.org/justin/webmachine/ \n) as a pretty good example as to what I&#39;m looking for.\n\nJan Vincent Liwanag\njvliwanag@...\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
