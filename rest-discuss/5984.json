REST also proposes to solve this problem.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is the use of continuations to implement application flow RESTful?  Does \n&gt; it complement REST or detract from it?  Does it depend on how the \n&gt; continuations are represented?\n&gt;\n&gt; Is it more RESTful:\n&gt;\n&gt;     * To embed the entire continuation in the page, or just use a\n&gt;       continuation ID?\n&gt;     * To store the continuation on the client or the server?\n&gt;     * To put the continuation ID in the URL path, or in the query\n&gt;     part?\n\nI&#39;ve been meaning to write something about continuations for ages.\n\nNot only do I believe they are not RESTfull (because the resources\ndon&#39;t really represent anything) but I also believe they&#39;re a bad\nidea.\n\nUnless the continuation&#39;s state can be parcelled up with the\ncontinuation (and they&#39;re aren&#39;t many languages that support that -\neven LISPs can&#39;t the C bits of the stack) then you&#39;re going to need to\nscale with increasing hardware rather than multiple machines.\n\nIn other words the problem is how do you load balance continuations?\nThey&#39;re state so it&#39;s hard to do. Massive virtualization tools might\nhelp but people aren&#39;t focused on building those for languages that\nsupport continuations.\n\n\n\nIt&#39;s one of those things; it seems like a really good idea and that it\nsolves some problems but it only does so for simple use cases.\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
