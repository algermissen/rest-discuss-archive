How do I know that I can call PUT, DELETE, GET &gt;&gt;or POST on that one url?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Because it&#39;s an URL.\n&gt; \n&gt; So then, I am forced to make multiple requests to figure out what I can do? Because it&#39;s a URL, I hope that a PUT works.. and if it doesn&#39;t, I&#39;ve wasted a round trip to be told it doesn&#39;t accept a PUT? That seems really ass backwards to me to be honest.\n\nAsk yourself *why* you PUT in the first place. Surely not just to see if something happens - the media types involved will tell you the semantics of link targets (e.g. &quot;this is contact info&quot;). If your intention is to update contact info PUT is the natural thing to do because the HTTP spec tells you so. What other method would you use to update the contact info? DELETE? It makes no sense to specifiy the supported methods because they are not interchangeable.\n\n(HTML forms just do that because they are a single hypermedia control for two entirely different kinds of operations (indexing vs. data submission). Better would probably have been some kind of &lt;indexable href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;input ...&gt;&lt;/indexable&gt; and &lt;dataSink href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;input.../&gt;&lt;/dataSink&gt;.\n\nInstead of trying to read some fancy mechanisms into the hypermedia constraint, focus on proper media type design instead - that is hard enough already...\n\n\n&gt; Maybe it&#39;s the right way, but it sure seems silly that we have the capability to return a response that includes enough info in it to save the client side (and server side) from wasted round trips just because that&#39;s the way it&#39;s supposed to be.\n\nMaybe it helps if you sketch some interactions where you think you would need some @methods?\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; By this I mean.. why should a client waste another round trip hoping something &gt;&gt;works, when it might not.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;If you&#39;re looking for guarantees, stick to a LAN.  But even then...\n&gt; &gt;does including &quot;delete&quot; in @methods, and making that page cacheable\n&gt; &gt;for a day mean that all DELETE operations on that URL for the next day\n&gt; &gt;will never return anything other than 2xx?  Of course not.  Stuff\n&gt; &gt;changes, and you need to start writing code that can deal with that.\n&gt; \n&gt; Agreed.. and plan to.. but why not help reduce network load, server load, and wasting client time when we can provide the info that does all that?\n\nDoes *what*? Suppose you try to PUT and the server tells you that PUT is not supported? Do you think you would change the method and retry the request? What the server is really telling you is that your assumptions are broken and changing the method will not help that.\n\n\n&gt; I guess I am failing to understand who made up these rules that a client can just assume all HTTP methods will work... and oops.. if only we had been given a wee bit more info that a PUT was not acceptable on this URL before we made that call and got slapped on the wrist.\n\nHey - do you PUT to a resource because there is some information that tells you that the resourece accets PUT? Or do you also use other information about the resource?\n\nJan\n\n\n&gt; It seems silly to me that this is the way it must work or it&#39;s not REST. Or maybe I am misunderstanding something... but it sounds like Mark, you are saying, too bad, deal with it, code for it, that&#39;s the way it works.
