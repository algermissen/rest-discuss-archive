Why not copy?\n\n&gt; It is really a server operation, not a per-resource operation. I don&#39;t know\n&gt; the SSL+HTTP stuff, so it might be a lot more similar that I&#39;m thinking.\n\nI think that RFC 2817 bears study. I&#39;d almost use it as a template for a \nnew one.\n\n&gt; So what are the choices?\n&gt; a) Upgrade header\n&gt;  - what method(s) or resources would this apply to? (probably OPTIONS...)\n&gt;  - is it sufficiently like keep-alive that is applies to multiple requests?\n\nIt applies to the *socket*. You are switching protocols from HTTP to \n&quot;Reverse HTTP&quot; which happens to have identical syntax and semantics to \nHTTP except you never create a Reverse HTTP connection directly, you \nalways get one by reusing an ordinary HTTP socket.\n\n&gt;  - am I worrying over nothing regarding Upgrade and multiple\n&gt; resources/methods?\n&gt; \n&gt; b) CONNECT method\n&gt;  - how would this work?\n&gt;  - CONNECT seems to be per-host rather than per-resource (you couldn&#39;t have\n&gt; multiple resources, one per &#39;message queue&#39;- but this might simplify\n&gt; security/authority issues)\n&gt;  - what is CONNECT used for anyway? Is it for tunning a /different/ protocol\n&gt; over port 80 to a destination system?\n\nYes. Like HTTPS or &quot;Reverse HTTP&quot;.\n\n&gt; c) new method (TURN or something)\n\nI don&#39;t think that there is a need for it.\n\n  Paul Prescod\n\n\n"}}
