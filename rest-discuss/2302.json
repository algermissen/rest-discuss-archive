When you send a message concerning that future behavior, it \nwill be governed by the contractual commitment.\n\nSo the message that is governed by the contractual commitment may be \nclear in its own contents, but it is not independent of the \ncommitment in its business effect.\n\nTherefore should it reference the commitment, or include it inline?\n\n(Or something else?)\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n\n"}}
