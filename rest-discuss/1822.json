So yes,\n&gt;&gt; you do need a TURN/ETRN and it won&#39;t be backwards compatible. My\n&gt;&gt; instinct is to have the client open a socket and ask for a backchannel\n&gt;&gt; with a POST. The server creates a &quot;listener&quot; and returns the port number\n&gt;&gt; and maybe some authentication data. The client connects *not* using HTTP\n&gt;&gt; but using a &quot;reversible socket protocol&quot;. The client and server\n&gt;&gt; understand that on the reversed socket they have swapped roles.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes - this sounds good. REST by its nature has &#39;passive resources&#39; and\n&gt; &#39;active clients&#39; that initiate operations upon those resources - it\n&gt; inherently implies direction of messaging. To implement this in the real\n&gt; world - as with http - you naively open a connection to the resource - but\n&gt; if it is behind a firewall then you can&#39;t.\n\nYes definitely.\n\nQuick question - is the assumption of a friendly, non-firewalled / NAT&#39;d\nintermediary a problem?  If not, the simplest / most RESTful solution may\nsimply be to allow the party behind the firewall to run a regular HTTP\nserver, allow that &quot;blocked&quot; party to establish a tunnel (HTTP, presumably)\nto the third party, and subsequently adopt all of the port 80 traffic to\nthat intermediary or, better, by engaging in a RESTful protocol *adopt* a\nportion of the intermediary&#39;s HTTP namespace.  Requests to the intermediary\nare then funneled down the backchannel to the client, where they are locally\ndispatched onto the local HTTP server, and responses channeled back along\nthe reverse path.\n\nThis portion is a lot like mounting a filesystem from one server on another\nserver then subsequently mounting the filesystem from the second server on\nsome client for access --- except it deals directly with the directionality\nproblem of HTTP.\n\n&gt; Hence Paul&#39;s suggestion -\n&gt; separate who /initiates/ the networking from the /direction/ of messages. I\n&gt; don&#39;t have a problem with the protocol for behind-the-firewall access being\n&gt; non-HTTP or at least non-sanctioned HTTP clone.\n\nActually I do, but only in that I see it proliferating protocols and code\nwhere it&#39;s strictly speaking neither optimal or necessary.\n\nJb\n\n\n"}}
