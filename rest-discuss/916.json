You MUST look up the real names of these things. You MUST\nNOT presume that the file system namespace is consistent.\n\n&gt; &gt; Indirecting well-known\n&gt; &gt; paths through something like an environment variable or registry setting\n&gt; &gt; or hypertext document has *nothing to do* with whether installation goes\n&gt; &gt; into a single directory. You&#39;re just trying to tar the idea through\n&gt; &gt; proximity to bad ideas.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sigh.  Paul, you&#39;re getting the independent threads of this conversation tangled --- not suprising,\n&gt; given your Webby proclivities.  ;-)  The point I was making re: the registry is that some\n&gt; installation mechanisms dispense with this indirection entirely, creating self-contained\n&gt; installations / configurations rather than interacting with settings in the registry / environment /\n&gt; what-have-you.  This isn&#39;t a bad idea, it&#39;s a good idea --- and it&#39;s one of the motivating ideas\n&gt; behind .NET, behind the ROX desktop, behind some aspects of how NeXT / OS X package software, etc.\n\nYou&#39;re going to have to provide some evidence for that statement. For\ninstance how does .NET in any way remove a level of indirection from the\nfilesystem?\n\n&gt; &gt; Let&#39;s put it this way. Opaque names and non-opaque names can both be\n&gt; &gt; redirected and relocated equally easily. *BUT* if the authoritative,\n&gt; &gt; official way to navigate from one name to another is through name\n&gt; &gt; similarlity relationships rather than through hypertext relationships\n&gt; &gt; then it becomes impossible for two related names to be directly served\n&gt; &gt; off of unrelated servers in a domain-name based system.\n&gt; \n&gt; Not at all --- this appears to be an overgeneralization.  In order for this to make sense, you need\n&gt; to describe specifically what the relationship between the two names is and why this relationship\n&gt; prevents being served from unrelated servers.\n\nI have a resource that represents a user and one that represents a\nuser&#39;s bio. I could use the namespace: /users/paul/bio or I could use\nhypertext /users/paul#xptr(document(@bio)). In the latter case, the\nthing referenced by @bio can live anywhere on the Web, even at a\ngnutella:// URI. In the former case I need to set up a redirect from\n/users/paul/bio to the real location.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
