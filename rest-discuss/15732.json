And either\n&gt; classification wouldn&#39;t be fact even if many physicists, our\n&gt; commonsense, and wikipedia conclude it&#39;s a solid. \n&gt;\n\nWell, Wikipedia is hardly a normative reference for anything... but\neven Wikipedia recognizes that a true solid has crystalline structure,\nclassifies glass as an &#39;amorphous solid&#39;, and recognizes that &quot;glass\ncrystal&quot; is a common misnomer.  Wikipedia also states that glass is\nmade by heating SiO2 until it melts -- it&#39;s hard to conceive of a solid\nsubstance melting into another solid substance.\n\nWhether you want to call glass a liquid or an amorphous solid, the fact\nremains that it has no crystalline structure, doesn&#39;t cool back into\ncrystalline SiO2, and therefore cannot be classified as a true solid,\nwhich is why it must be classified with the term &quot;amorphous&quot; when it&#39;s\ncalled a solid -- the definition of amorphous means that it can&#39;t be\ndefinitively classified a solid.\n\nIf there&#39;s a flaw in my analogy, it&#39;s that I fudged and claimed glass\nto be a liquid, when I should have asserted simply that it isn&#39;t a true\nsolid.  But in lay terms, non-solids are liquids or gasses, and no\ndistinction is made between amorphous vs. true solids.  So the argument\nis one of precision terminology.\n\nWhich leads us back to REST.  The claim that a representation is a\nresource is wrong, of course.  The common advice to treat variants as\nresources in their own right, should really be &quot;treat variants also as\nrepresentations of another resource&quot; but that&#39;s more confusing to say.\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n"}}
