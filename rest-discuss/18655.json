If you have components that do not pl=\r\nay by the rules, you loose what the rules were intended for, and thus the q=\r\nuality of service suffers. If the service is good or bad, well used or not,=\r\n that impacts the system somehow. So, a misbehaving client should be taken =\r\nseriously into account, even if it doesn&#39;t take your badge away. \n\nTo me, t=\r\nhe REST certificate is useless beyond marketing and selling points. It will=\r\n not give much if the architecture is not controlled and governed as it sho=\r\nuld.\n\nFinally, and to be fair that is my line of thinking &quot;out of the bun&quot;,=\r\n I have a presentation of a talk I gave at the SOA and Cloud Symposium, Bra=\r\nzil, where I explained why a RESTful service may come with a little of impe=\r\ndance mismatch, and as such is not suitable for many business cases. In tha=\r\nt sense, the service may have its implementation in perfect REST, with a pe=\r\nrfect client, and still the quality may be poor.\n\nMaybe the main point here=\r\n is not the badge thing, but agreeing that there are concerns that are deep=\r\ner and far more important that the actual badge itself. What do you think?\n=\r\n\nWilliam.\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Juan Lanus &lt;juan.lanus@...&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;A client not obeying the rules does not necessarily remove a=\r\nll benefits\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; REST for the server, though it can if it is the ONLY c=\r\nlient.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t get this. For example, if I had a fully RESTful server=\r\n publishing a\n&gt; public service consumed by one and only one fully REST-comp=\r\nliant client,\n&gt; and somebody created another client which is not REST-compl=\r\niant, then what?\n&gt; Would the service be deprived of it&#39;s badge?\n&gt; Of course=\r\n it won&#39;t!\n&gt; \n&gt; IMO this thread is so lengthy because it started with a &quot;RE=\r\nSTful system&quot;\n&gt; idea which IMO is a wild horse, the RESTful certificate is =\r\nonly for\n&gt; services (the server) and clients can leverage RESTfulness or no=\r\nt, at will,\n&gt; without affecting the service&#39;s quality.\n&gt; \n&gt; The client can&#39;=\r\nt be RESTful, as it does not communicate with its (human\n&gt; client) user thr=\r\nough HTTP.\n&gt; --\n&gt; JL\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
