Have the user observe some property of the system to determine\n&gt;&gt; whether to retry themselves. [...]\n&gt;\n&gt; [...]\n&gt; A technique I&#39;ve used once was to have the client send an HTTP header\n&gt; in the POST request which played a role sort of like a client-side\n&gt; etag with respect to the request body.  The server, upon receiving the\n&gt; message and updating the state of the resource, would return another\n&gt; header containing a hash of the last days worth of tags (which wasn&#39;t\n&gt; many) on GET requests to that resource so that it could check if *its*\n&gt; update was applied.\n\nYes, I was thinking about taking the POST-and-GET-to-check route instead\nof a special interaction pattern. In the case of APP this would be  \neven simpler,\nas all I&#39;d need to be looking for as a client is the existence of the  \nPOSTed entry\nin the collection (though I&#39;ll have to do some more evaluation of how  \nto actually\ncheck for identity[1]..ETag, Atom ID,...)\n\nOne problem of this I see is laency. When could the client expect  \nthat its POST\ndid not came through if it does not see the intended effect? What if  \nthe POST response\n(the one id did not receive) was 202 as opposed to 201?\n\nJan\n\n[1] Mark, how did you ensure Client-ETag uniqueness across clients?\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Interesting post...\n&gt;\n&gt; Mark.\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Mark Baker.
