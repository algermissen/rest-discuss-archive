Specifically:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. What form would the representation of service composition take?\n\nA pipeline.\n\n&gt; 2. How to handle dynamic binding of multiple services within a \n&gt; session, given that REST is a stateless and asynchronous model?\n\nWhy is a session required?\n\n&gt; 3. How to automate service discovery, invocation (possibly using \n&gt; ontology-aware agents?), and execution completion notification, with \n&gt; provision for graceful recovery from a failed composite service \n&gt; execution?\n\nWhoa, slow down there.  &quot;service discovery&quot; is what you do when you\nfind a URI in some manner.  &quot;invocation&quot; is just the passage of a\nmessage (GET, POST, whatever) through a set of intermediaries in\nsome order.  &quot;execution completion notification&quot; seems to be\nsuggesting that a &quot;session&quot; exists.  No such beast is required.\nThe message is entirely self-describing.\n\n&gt; In a simple composition model, a client (or possibly a coordinator \n&gt; service) would be responsible for obtaining URLs of the service \n&gt; providers, invoking them in some order, and converting responses from \n&gt; one provider into a parameter that would go into the request message \n&gt; to the other providers.\n\nRight, hence the use of data-flow style composition in REST, which is\nmuch much simpler because all components have a uniform interface.\nThis is much more amenable to decentralization too.  I know because\nour platform supports fully decentralized routing as well as hub-and-\nspoke if so desired.\n\n&gt;  Some way of specifiying  how to tranform \n&gt; between representations would be necessary.  Also, this means that \n&gt; the client (or coordinator) would be responsible for monitoring the \n&gt; state of the service composition process.   \n\nSessions = bad.\n\n&gt; What are the kinds of compositions that would work best under REST? \n\nMessage pipelining is an obvious one.  I think there are others.\nKnowNow found one with the symmetry between GET responses and POST\nrequests.  It&#39;s still a pipeline, but it&#39;s different than with\nintermediaries since it&#39;s not a message pipeline, but a message *body*\npipeline.  I&#39;m still trying to figure out the difference.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
