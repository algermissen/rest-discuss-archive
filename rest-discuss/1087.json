I\n&gt; began implementing those ideas, but abandoned them as the code began\n&gt; to get more and more repetitive.  Writing a REST application seems\n&gt; naturally suited to a code generator.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, what description format should this code generator take?\n&gt; Paul uses a WSDL example in his latest xml.com article, but observes\n&gt; that WSDL doesn&#39;t support links.  I also noticed that the WSDL note\n&gt; only mentions HTTP GET/POST, and for a code generator you&#39;d want to\n&gt; say what other HTTP operations (DEL, PUT, &c) are supported on a\n&gt; resource.  Also, the authors of the note are all from large companies\n&gt; that have embraced SOAP, making me pessimistic about the likelihood of\n&gt; improving the WSDL HTTP binding.\n&gt;\n&gt; The other option is Paul&#39;s WRDL, but its current state of completion\n&gt; isn&#39;t clear, though the TODO list does seem to be mostly second-order\n&gt; things.\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyone have suggestions on which format would be the best choice?\n&gt;\n&gt; --amk\n(www.amk.ca)\n&gt; &quot;Symbols have *power*, Netley...
