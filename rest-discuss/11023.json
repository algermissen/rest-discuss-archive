When I  \n&gt; looked at the time, searching various articles and email lists led  \n&gt; me to the belief that this was, in fact, required behavior.  Sadly,  \n&gt; I did not maintain any bookmarks to the documents that (at the time)  \n&gt; led me to that conclusion.\n&gt;\n&gt; Digging a bit further, it looks like this is (at least for Squid 2  \n&gt; or later) simply the *default* behavior, and you can configure Squid  \n&gt; to cache such responses if you want to -- [2] includes one example  \n&gt; of how to cache things with request parameters as long as expiry  \n&gt; information was included.  However, it still seems doubtful to me  \n&gt; that one could count on this unless it is on a cache that you  \n&gt; control the configuration of (such as a cache in front of your  \n&gt; search application to reduce the load when there are many equivalent  \n&gt; queries).  Based on that, I&#39;d still select the former format if I  \n&gt; thought caching would matter for my app (in addition to other  \n&gt; reasons, like an aesthetic preference for including the complete  \n&gt; resource identifier in the URL itself, and using request parameters  \n&gt; for other purposes).\n\nThat&#39;s an interesting conclusion to come to. By that conclusion, most  \nof cache hits on the web will be negative - i.e., http://mystore.com, http://mystore.com/product?id=1 \n  and http://mystore.com/product?id=2 will all be treated equivalent  \nby caches. It would be a confusing web indeed ;)\n\nI am not a squid expert, but the link [http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/StoreUrlRewrite \n] does not have anything to do with ignoring query strings from URIs.  \nThe only thing relevant I notice is the DENY setting for URIs  \ncontaining cgi-bin. This setting is still questionable, but there may  \nbe some historical reasons for that.\n\nSubbu\n\n"}}
