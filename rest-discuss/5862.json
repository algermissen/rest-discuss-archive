Restrict yourself to the HTTP methods as the verbs for your \n&gt; webservice, eg:\n&gt;\n&gt; GET     get the resource\n&gt; POST    create a new resource\n&gt; PUT     edit the resource\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThis is good advice, and the above seems to be what one would generally \nexpect, more or less. Depending on the application, POST may have \nalternate semantics and, assuming the client knows where things are \nsupposed to go or owns the URI space (e.g. operations within a users own \naccount area), PUT may be used for resource creation.\n\n&gt; DELETE  move the resource\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nWhat? That&#39;s just crazy. How did DELETE suddenly become MOVE? Would you \nthen need to use POST for DELETE? Seems not so good to me, but if you \naren&#39;t willing to support WebDAV methods for namespace operations than \nthis might be acceptable, if slightly unorthodox.\n\nThis has been, to some extent, a personal crusade of mine -- to get \npeople to realize that REST is more than GET, PUT, POST and DELETE. \nThere are other methods available whendeveloping REST applications \nwithin the framework of the Web; MOVE,  COPY and MKCOL for namespace \noperations, PROPPATCH and PROPFIND for working with resource metadata, \nLOCK and UNLOCK for managing access to resources, etc.\n\n&gt; HEAD    brief overview of the resource\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nWell, in as much as the HTTP headers returned on a GET provide an \noverview of a resource... Some systems will maintain &#39;summary resources&#39; \nthat have their own URI. Obviously the approach taken depends on the \nspecifics of your particular application.\n\n\nCheers,\nElias\n\nP.S.
