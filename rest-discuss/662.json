You\n&gt; could argue that requiring subscribers to be servers is a bad idea for\n&gt; security reasons or whatever, but it isn&#39;t in conflict with HTTP!\n\nNo, the conflict is philosophical.  HTTP says that\na client makes a request for information and the\nserver delivers it.  Defining a new protocol that\nworks by requesting information and getting it\ndelivered over another connection later is not in\nthe spirit of HTTP.\n\n&gt; If we really decide that the &quot;right thing&quot; is a TCP connection from\n&gt; subscriber to publisher then we would have to invent a non-HTTP\n&gt; protocol. I can see various practical limits including:\n&gt;\n&gt;  * limits on numbers of TCP connctions on particular machines\n&gt;  * timeouts\n&gt;  * firewalls\n&gt;  * security admins freaking out about the number of open connections\n\nAgain, I refer you to the discussion from before.\nLimits on the numbers of TCP connections is\nentirely artificial.  Mike and Jeff both referred\nto implementations with 50k connections per\nmachine.\n\nTimeouts are handled by periodic reconnects.\nFirewalls are BETTER handled by using GET.\n\nSecurity admins freaking is just part of life.\nThe typical client is not going to have that many\nconnections open.  Since users are already using\nIM I am not sure this is really an issue.\n\n&gt; Think about Google subscribing to notifications from every news site in\n&gt; the world. I can&#39;t imagine it keeping TCP connections open to tens of\n&gt; thousands of them at a time. You&#39;re going to run into some serious OS\n&gt; limitations.\n\nThese OS limitations are entirely spurious.  There\nis no reason why socket information cannot be\nstored in virtual memory (on disk).  I don&#39;t think\nyour scaling argument is good here.\n\nMore to the point, I don&#39;t think you can make a\nsolid argument that the load from notification\nback and forth is really higher than maintaining\nopen GET connections.  I think GET Events is\nactually much MORE scalable than notification!\n\n-Alex-\n\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
