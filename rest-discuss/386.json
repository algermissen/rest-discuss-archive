Far from it.  I have said *nothing* of the\nkind.  And I wish you would work through the implications correctly before\nattacking implications I have not made.\n\nAll existing ideas on how to do callbacks have centered on a callback URI.\nThere&#39;s a source that has an event to post, to make that happen it sends some\nbytes to the sink callback URI; the sink is running a server on the callback\nIP:port.  This is exactly the same in PSP as in full scale HTTP 1.1.   In fact,\nneither can pass through the firewall.\n\nFirewalls are a completely separate conversation.  PSP is merely and only a\nmeans of implementing callbacks without introducing new security problems.\n\n(Uh, actually there&#39;s one tiny difference between UDP and TCP servers for the\npurposes of breaking into the firewall -- UDP can sometimes pass through NATs.\nThat&#39;s a trivial difference that isn&#39;t consistently enough available to care\nabout, which is why I didn&#39;t mention it.)\n\n\n"}}
