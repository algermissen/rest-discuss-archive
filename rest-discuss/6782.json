I suggested that\nthe simplest solution was simply polling. My colleague stated that it\nwouldn&#39;t work because of scalablity concerns.\n\nThe thing about a REST app is that scalability of polling is really,\nreally good. A RESTfull poll is probably just a conditional GET, eg:\n\n   GET /someeventstatus\n   If-modified-since: LASTDATEOFCHANGE\n\nconditional GETs are mostly _really_ cheap to implement.\n\n-- \nNic Ferrier\nhttp://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk   for all your tapsell ferrier needs\n\n"}}
