And as\n&gt; I tend to be a lot more technically advanced than the average person, even\n&gt; more reason to argue against XSLT for mainstream use.\n&gt; \n\nThat you were technically advanced may well have contributed to your \ndifficulties. XSLT was designed to be easier to use for web developers \nand other non-traditional programmers. I&#39;ve mostly taught XSLT to \nprogrammers myself, but my friends who&#39;ve taught it to non-programmers \nas well report that the non-programmers actually &quot;get it&quot; faster than \nthe programmers do. Non-programmers perhaps don&#39;t have some of the same \npreconceptions we programmers do. Lord knows I had to unlearn enough \nthings when I was first learning XSLT. It really is a different sort of \nlanguage.\n\nYou may well have been happier with XQuery than XSLT, though practically \nthat wasn&#39;t an option until the last year or two. XQuery was explicitly \ndesigned to be more familiar and comfortable than XSLT to programmers \nexperienced in traditional imperative languages like Java and C.\n\n-- \nElliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nJava I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n\n"}}
