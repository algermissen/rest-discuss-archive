Webhooks are a way of doing callba=\r\ncks between components that are accessible on the Web (have a HTTP URI), wh=\r\nich are server components. However, the Web is still a client-server model =\r\nwhere clients are not exposed on the Web. \n\nUsing the PubSubHubBub protocol=\r\n as an example, the entity subscribing to a Hub must pass an URI that will =\r\nbe used by the Hub to notify it of new posts. Entities on the Web having UR=\r\nIs are server components, so PSHB itself can&#39;t be used to push notification=\r\ns to client components, but only to servers which then must transfer the no=\r\ntification to the client (somehow). If the Web was p2p, a client could be a=\r\n PSHB subscriber as it would (be able to) have a (HTTP) URI.\n\nDoes this mak=\r\ne sense?\n\nIvan\n\n--- In rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com, Mike Kelly &lt;mike@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Do WebHooks make for a p2p web?\n&gt; \n&gt; If so; I guess a (registere=\r\nd?!) media type and/or some link relations\n&gt; would be required to make it R=\r\nESTful?\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, Oct 15, 2010 at 6:37 PM, izuzak=\r\n &lt;izuzak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi Nathan,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A p2p REST style, and consequen=\r\ntly a p2p Web, is definitely not rambling -- what it *is* is the focus of m=\r\ny ph.d. research :).
