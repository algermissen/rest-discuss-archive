I think of my\n&gt; bank statement as my bank statement and I think most people do.\n\nNo, there are three resources.  One is your generic bank statement.\nSecond is your bank statement in PDF.  Third is your bank statement\nin HTML.  Three distinct resources calls for three distinct URIs,\neven if one of them is just a negotiation point for the rest.\n\n&gt; Resources should not be tied to representations.  The reason for this\n&gt; is that the resource that identifies my bank statement should always\n&gt; be the same. When I&#39;m seventy (if I still have the same bank account\n&gt; which is pretty unlikely I have to say) I&#39;d expect my bank statement\n&gt; URI to be the same.\n\nThat is true for some interactions, but not all.  Authoring, for\nexample, should always be performed on a specific URI that is\ndependent on the format, since that allows you to author many\ndifferent representations for the more generic URI at the same\ntime without having to rely on server gymnastics to understand\nwhat resource is being authored.\n\n&gt; Ok. So it comes down to whether you accept that Cool URIs Don&#39;t\n&gt; Change is part of REST. I can&#39;t remember if there&#39;s anything in Roy&#39;s\n&gt; original paper about this. But since this stuff is quite clear in the\n&gt; HTTP spec I believe that cool URIs don&#39;t change. /8-&gt;\n\nThose are orthogonal issues.  The fact that you have one URI that\nis generic does not in any way limit the number of less generic\nURIs that are also used and available within an application.\nAll URIs are important.\n\nREST is designed so that URI references don&#39;t need to change,\nwhich is the principle behind Tim&#39;s &quot;cool URIs don&#39;t change&quot;\ncomments.  That is the final bit of\n\n    This abstract definition of a resource enables key features\n    of the Web architecture. First, it provides generality by\n    encompassing many sources of information without artificially\n    distinguishing them by type or implementation. Second, it\n    allows late binding of the reference to a representation,\n    enabling content negotiation to take place based on\n    characteristics of the request. Finally, it allows an author\n    to reference the concept rather than some singular\n    representation of that concept, thus removing the need to\n    change all existing links whenever the representation\n    changes (assuming the author used the right identifier).\n\nUsing the right identifier requires that identifiers be available\nfor everything one might want to identify, including each individual\nresource that makes up the value set of some &quot;cool URI&quot; resource.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
