So thank you.\n\nBut now let me get this straight. I hope you&#39;ll forgive my naive questions.\n\nOn Sun, May 4, 2008 at 2:39 AM, Sebastien Lambla &lt;seb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  &gt; than HTML forms are; it&#39;s just another media type. It&#39;s not &quot;specific\n&gt;  &gt; to my service&quot; because, once again, it&#39;s a (hypothetical) standard\n&gt;  &gt; media type.\n&gt;\n&gt;  You may well be right in the sense that you rely on an informational\n&gt;  resource to tell you how to construct a url. That said, I fail to see how\n&gt;  [...]\n\nI&#39;ll hook up here, and try to go back to my original example.\n\nSo I think I understand (and like) the principle of discoverability,\nin the sense that the client should not be held responsible to come up\nwith urls. Instead it should somehow be told about them by the server.\nThe client remains responsible for is the _why_ a given url is needed,\nbut the _how_ is told by the server. Good.\n\nSo, back to my image repository example: let&#39;s assume that the\npreferred representation is Json and that the client wants to make use\nof a url identifying a given set of images. Gary proposed an approach\nmaking use of a &quot;text/html-with-javascript-links&quot; media type, with the\nrepresentation being some html containing a javascript code snippet.\nMy first question: can I safely translate that proposal to my example\nby rewriting that code snippet as the following Json data structure?\n{\n  imageSetUrlBuilder: &quot;function(ids) { return &#39;/resources/&#39; + ids.join(&#39;,&#39;); }&quot;\n}\n\nThe client application, of course, should know how to deal with such\ninformation, just like it should know about the\ntext/html-with-javascript-links media type, or anything else. I&#39;d say,\nit actually _expects_ it, rather than just knowing how to deal with\nit.\n\nNow my second question: which part of my url space is better suited\nfor containing this piece of Json?\nIf I think about it, it seems like some sort of application global\n&quot;information&quot;. It&#39;s a piece of functionality (in the form of a\njavascript code snippet) that the client app needs to fetch right at\nthe beginning in order to be fully functional. So, I&#39;d say, the root\nurl (/) is the best place, together with all the other stuff I might\nlike to include in the root url, i.e. the one representing my\napplication in general, including other urls. For example:\n{\n  imageSetUrlBuilder: &quot;function(ids) { return &#39;/resources/&#39; + ids.join(&#39;,&#39;); }&quot;,\n  allImagesUrl: &quot;/images&quot;,\n  title: &quot;My fancy application&quot;\n}\n\nWhat do you think? Am I beginning to see more RESTy? :)\n\nThanks\nStefano\n\n"}}
