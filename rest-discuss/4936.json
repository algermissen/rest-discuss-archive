You POST based on information you\n&gt; previously received in an HTML form. Mark Baker proposed RDF Forms\n&gt; http://www.markbaker.ca/2003/05/RDF-Forms/ and that is one way you \n&gt; could\n&gt; promote similar discovery in machine-to-machine processing. The RDF \n&gt; form\n&gt; tells the invoker the media type(s) to POST.\n\nExactly.  The same mechanism that tells the client what URI to use\nis going to define either a specific media type to use in the POST\nor a range of media types based on whatever application is defined\nby that mechanism.  Usually, that mechanism is described within the\nclient&#39;s current application state in the forms of a prior media\ntype (hypertext), but it could also be defined externally via an IDL\nor even a command-line interface.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n"}}
