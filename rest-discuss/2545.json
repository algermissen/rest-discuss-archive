When\n&gt; the client PUTs a resource they have no way of actually knowing\n&gt; whether they&#39;re simply updating a resource or creating a brand new\n&gt; resource. These are two very different things and you should force\n&gt; the client to acknowledge the distinction using POST.\nWhy? If I only ever POST to uri1 to update the resource, isn&#39;t that the same\nas PUT to uri1, only obscured?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) Because of the principle of URI opacity, it&#39;s in poor taste to\n&gt; let the client assign URIs to new resources.\nI don&#39;t understand that reasoning. Opacity to me means that you can&#39;t\nexaming a portion of a URI to infer its meaning or usage - there has to be\nsome other out-of-band communication to do that. I don&#39;t see how it is\nrelated to which side generates the URI.\n\n&gt; Only the server should know about URI construction.\nI strongly disagree.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 3) 90%+ of the time when a new resource is created (eg a purchase\n&gt; order, user, document, order) you rely on the database to assign a\n&gt; unique ID of the resource.\nNot in my systems. I tend to go for longevity and scalability rather than\ntrivially relying on database ids.\nIf you need to map external ids to storage ids, then add a column for the\n&#39;public identifier&#39;. That&#39;s why email addresses aren&#39;t numbers and haven&#39;t\nbeen since CompuServe went out of business.\n\n&gt; Then, the URL you assign to that resource\n&gt; includes the ID or a hash of the id (eg /purchase-\n&gt; orders/po321343, /users/hash(social-security-#), /orders/332-43-\n&gt; 43523) etc. If you use PUT you rarely can enforce this interface.\nAnd when you blow out your database and re-created it, all the IDs are\nregenerated... hmm...\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 4) Load balancing. When new resources are created you might want to\n&gt; spread them out among many different servers particularly if these\n&gt; are temporary resources. If you use PUT you can&#39;t do this because\n&gt; the client decides which machine will contain the resource (or at\n&gt; least process the creation request). This is often a bad idea.\nThere are lots of ways to coordinate the client and server addressing to\nachieve this.\nYou could just randomly respond with a redirect to a different machine and\nthe client should re-try the request at the new location.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 5) It is very easy to enforce security when POST is used against a\n&gt; single URI for resource creation.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 6) I think the RFC is just being flexible. AFAIK, POST as always\n&gt; meant APPEND TO DOCUMENT/PROCESS DOCUMENT and PUT as always meant\n&gt; WRITE.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; So, for hopefully the last time, I&#39;d say use POST to mean resource\n&gt; creation and PUT to mean update.\nAhh... you aren&#39;t saying /never/ use PUT, just use it for only updates...\n\n\n\n"}}
