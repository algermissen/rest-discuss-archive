I have written down some ideas I had a while back.\n&gt; While writing it down, I tried to keep REST (as I understood it at the\ntime)\n&gt; in mind during some of the design process.  I would be curious to see what\n&gt; others thought about how RESTful this is or is not and what would improve\n&gt; it&#39;s RESTfulness.  If nothing else, this may allow me to better understand\n&gt; REST principles at work by looking at something in a context I am familiar\n&gt; with (that isn&#39;t HTTP).  Note that this is a draft document (and all that\n&gt; goes with it).\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.seairth.com/web/rpc/gtp.html\n&gt;\nCool.\n\n&gt;&gt; &quot;In data manipulation, there are five basic possible actions: ADD, EDIT,\nDELETE, GET, and PUT&quot;\nComing up with basic actions for data manipulation is a great start. I&#39;ve\nhad problems with the particular ones from HTTP, as well as the ones from\nSQL.\nWith ADD, what are you adding data to? Why isn&#39;t there a remove?\n\nInteresting...\nI&#39;ll have to take some time with this paper. Thanks.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
