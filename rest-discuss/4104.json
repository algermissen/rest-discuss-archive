If I do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; challenge/response, the user gets this scary popup dialog, without \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; important links for creating a new account and recovering your \n&gt; &gt; password.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But if I don&#39;t use that scary dialog, I have to use a cookie for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; authentication.  Neither option is good.\n&gt; &gt; [...]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; if tour only problem is to have some links to creation and recovery, \n&gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt; can put them in the 403 error page, since the user need them only if \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; login fails.\n&gt; \n&gt; This confounds user expectations.  Users without an account shouldn&#39;t \n&gt; be asked for their password unless they do something to indicate they \n&gt; have one.  A page with options for  ((1) logging in (2) recovering \n&gt; password (3) creating an account) matches user expectations, a \n&gt; challenge dialog with an option for entering your valid password \n&gt; doesn&#39;t.  I don&#39;t mean it matches expectations because it&#39;s the \n&gt; standard, although that&#39;s the truth.  I mean that it matches \n&gt; expectations because it matches the reality of a user&#39;s potential \n&gt; states.\n\nyou can still create a default page with the 3 links, and add the\nrecovering link to the error page. That is not an architectural problem,\nit&#39;s just GUI design\n\n&gt; Another reason is that challenge-response is fixed in the hierarchy of \n&gt; a web site.  You can&#39;t hit the challenge at /account and have the info \n&gt; still visible at /history.  However, with cookies you can login at \n&gt; /account and still have the authentication info visible at /history.  \n&gt; This is a common application requirement -- a web app frequently needs \n&gt; to handle a request differently depending on whether the user is logged \n&gt; in or whether the login account has write privs.\n\nthe virtual hierarchy implied by the uris deosn&#39;t have to be a real\nfolder/file hierarchy. For ex., your service root can be a cgi,\nmod_(php/perl/python) script, etc. taking its arguments from the rest of\nthe url...\n\nall the authentication process (whereever you are in the hierarchy) is\nmanaged by the service, which can decide wether the access can be\ngranted or not. as an example, imagine a webmail/news service.\nthe service is at / and it require a passwd for /mail but not for /news\n/mail/&lt;user&gt;/&lt;box&gt; return the content of the box, but the folder doesn&#39;t\nexist as a subfolder of /mail (the script can query a imap server,\nforwarding the user/password)\nAs long as the client sends the authentication headers, the\nauthentication is visible from everywhere...\n\n\n\n\n&gt; - Lucas\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
