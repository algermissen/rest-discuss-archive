My company has a REST web service that accepts POSTed\n&gt; data to it.  We wanted to return a 400 response code in cases where the data\n&gt; being sent is invalid for some reason ( invalid XML, invalid business rules,\n&gt; etc.. ) .  We also wanted to return specific validation messages as part of\n&gt; the response body.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, we&#39;re running into problems with some java clients because\n&gt; apparently the HttpUrlConnection class in the JDK swallows the response\n&gt; bodies when a 400 or higher return code is sent back:\n\nno, its worse than that. Historically, it&#39;s choice of action depended\non the extension of the remote URL. .html extensions tended to include\nthe test, but .jsp pages didnt.\n\nOne word: httpclient\n\n-steve\n\n"}}
