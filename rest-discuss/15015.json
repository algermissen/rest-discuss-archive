I think,\n&gt; &gt; perhaps, you&#39;re misi=\r\nnterpreting Roy&#39;s comment, &quot;A REST API should\n&gt; &gt; be entered with no prior =\r\nknowledge beyond the initial URI\n&gt; &gt; (bookmark)...&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, this is the =\r\nconstraint I am working with.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; This applies to the client&#39;s interacti=\r\non with the system.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes. But in this setup we have two clients. One cl=\r\nient is our\n&gt; front-end consuming the back-end API. Another client is the\n&gt;=\r\n web-browser consuming our front-end. Both consumers should behave\n&gt; RESTfu=\r\nl and have as little apriori knowledge as possible of the REST\n&gt; system it =\r\nconsumes.\n&gt; \n\nOK, I can see where you&#39;re going wrong.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Whereas, in a =\r\ndecoupled system, the back-end URI allocation can\n&gt; &gt; change and the front-=\r\nend only needs to be reconfigured.\n&gt; \n&gt; Stop. You said &quot;front-end needs to =\r\nbe reconfigured&quot;. This means you\n&gt; have a static coupling between your fron=\r\nt-end and your backend REST\n&gt; API. This is what I am trying to avoid. Every=\r\nbody says &quot;Thou shall\n&gt; not have static couplings to the REST API you consu=\r\nme&quot;.\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;m not interested in what everybody says; everybody gets REST wro=\r\nng.\nI&#39;m interested in what Roy says, which in this case would be along the\n=\r\nlines of, &quot;REST doesn&#39;t eliminate the need for a clue.&quot;  The wiski.org\n/dat=\r\ne service will eventually have an Xforms interface to describe the\nAPI -- a=\r\n URI template won&#39;t do, because the number of days in February\nis algorithm=\r\nic.  But, that doesn&#39;t mean a client of the API is required\nto be an Xforms=\r\n client, or otherwise consume that form.\n\nThe client connector of my proxy =\r\ncomponent (charger) isn&#39;t required to\ncode itself, nor is it required to be=\r\n some sort of AI driving a\nhypertext form.  Just as a Web page requires a u=\r\nser to make a choice.\nAll I need to know to write a simple proxy, is {YYYY-=\r\nMM-DD}.  My proxy\nisn&#39;t required to discover that URI template by itself.  =\r\nIt&#39;s still a\nREST client, and hypertext is still the engine of application =\r\nstate.\n\nREST is interested in the communication between charger and wiski.o=\r\nrg,\nand from the perspective of the protocol going across the wire, how\ncha=\r\nrger knows what resource to request from wiski.org remains opaque\nbehind th=\r\ne interface.  The communication meets every REST constraint, I\nassure you.\n=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now, imagine the mess updating the /date backend would cause, if al=\r\nl\n&gt; &gt; requests looked something like this:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://charger.bisonsyst=\r\nems.net/date?url=3Dhttp://en.wiski.org/date?iso=3D\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; See how, by tryi=\r\nng to pass the back-end URIs around inside the\n&gt; &gt; front-end URIs, the syst=\r\nem becomes coupled due to the requirement\n&gt; &gt; that the client must &quot;see&quot; be=\r\nyond the server it&#39;s interacting with\n&gt; \n&gt; But URLs are opaque - right? The=\r\n client, a web-browser, can ignore\n&gt; anything thats contained in &quot;?url=3D..=\r\n.&quot;. The stuff in the dots is just\n&gt; an opqaue identifier to the client. It =\r\ncould be anything. The fact\n&gt; that it is a URL is irrelevant to the client.=\r\n Some blogging system\n&gt; even has complete URLs as their ATOM identifiers.\n&gt;=\r\n \n\nHow does the client, making a request to charger, know the URI for\nen.wi=\r\nski.org?  If it&#39;s getting this URI from wiski.org, then asking\ncharger to t=\r\nranslate it, then the layered-system constraint is broken\nand the system is=\r\n coupled rather tightly.\n\nIf the client knows the en.wiski.org URI because =\r\ncharger told it so,\nthen charger obviously already knows wiski.org&#39;s API.  =\r\nFor charger to\npass this on to the client, would be to induce the coupling =\r\nincurred by\nbreaking the layered-system constraint.\n\nRegardless of how the =\r\nclient is instructed of this URI-within-a-URI,\nall bookmarks to charger bre=\r\nak if wiski.org changes its URI template,\nright?  Different naming authorit=\r\nies -- why make charger responsible\nfor changes to wiski.org?  You&#39;d have t=\r\no 301-redirect all old charger\nURIs to their current equivalents, as well a=\r\ns have charger start\nminting new URIs reflecting wiski.org&#39;s new URI templa=\r\nte.\n\nPlease tell me you see how this is coupling, and a bad thing.  If\nchar=\r\nger obeys the layered-system constraint, as it does now, then none\nof the U=\r\nRIs minted by charger in the past break, if wiski.org changes\nits URI templ=\r\nate.  The client is only interacting with charger, so\ncharger shouldn&#39;t be =\r\nexposing the URIs of another layer.\n\nIt doesn&#39;t really matter if the fronte=\r\nnd or the backend or some other\nsystem is generating those URIs.  If a chan=\r\nge to a backend URI format\ncauses frontend URIs to break, it&#39;s rather damni=\r\nng evidence of failure\nto apply the layered-system constraint.\n\nGranted, th=\r\ne URIs are opaque to the client, in that the client doesn&#39;t\nrecognize the w=\r\niski.org URIs as such, but the URIs still _break_ don&#39;t\nthey?  You can&#39;t si=\r\ndestep this coupling by declaring broken URIs opaque.\n\nNo REST constraint i=\r\ns being broken by having charger proxy wiski.org,\nthis is a common solution=\r\n to common problems of Web development.  Don&#39;t\nbelieve any argument that le=\r\nads you to conclude that setting up simple\nforwarding or proxying of URIs i=\r\ns forbidden by REST.  That just isn&#39;t\nthe case.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
