So I&#39;m planning =\r\nto set  \nup a simple vocabulary training program ...\n\nI imagine a central r=\r\nessource called &quot;trainer&quot; who&#39;s picking  \nexercises randomly. A request to =\r\nthe trainer would mean: &quot;give me the  \nnext exercise you want me to complet=\r\ne&quot;. The trainer responds with one  \nof many exercises most of the time. Aft=\r\ner having completed a certain  \nnumber of exercises the trainee would be di=\r\nrected to some kind of  \nsummary or statistics.\n\nHow should I model this?\n\n=\r\nAs the response of the trainer ressource is meant to change randomly  \nfor =\r\neach request, should I POST to this ressource? Or should I GET it  \nand red=\r\nirect the client through a location header? Or do something  \nelse that I&#39;m=\r\n missing?\n\nThis question could probably be reduced to &quot;How do I RESTfully t=\r\nhrow  \na dice?&quot;\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\n-- \nsven fuchs\t\t\tfon:  +49 (58 45) 98=\r\n 89 58\nartweb design\t\t\tfax:  +49 (58 45) 98 89 57\nbreite stra=DFe 65\t\twww: =\r\nhttp://www.artweb-design.de\nde-29468 bergen\t\tmail: svenfuchs@artweb-design.=\r\nde\n\n\n\n"}}
