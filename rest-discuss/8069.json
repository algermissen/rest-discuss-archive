Which I think\n&gt; is getting complicated and EPRish.\n\nActually, I&#39;ve been assuming seperation of concerns and that URI Templates\nwould continue down their current path, i.e. that URI Templates would not\nconstrain or dictate where the values come from to populate the template\nthus allowing potentially different solutions to supply those values for\nmany different contexts. As one such context I can envision a format\ndesigned to be used as the hypermedia component of REST, or even be a third\ncomponent that the hypermedia component leverages.\n\n&gt; The last time this got interesting was when Jon Udell\n&gt; started integrating libraries and amazon by scraping\n&gt; ISBNs out of Amazon URLs. I never head of anybody\n&gt; directly criticizing what he was doing; maybe it was\n&gt; because it was an insanely useful integration, despite\n&gt; the means.\n\nI actually read a lot of bitching about it (though I can&#39;t quickly dig up\nthe links), but the bitching seemed to be about principle while offering no\ntagible alternative solution, and ignoring the pragmatism of Jon&#39;s design\nand more importantly the minimal downsides if it broke. On that latter it\nseems to me the magnitude of problem created by violating URI Opacity is\nproportional to the amount of deployed code that utilizies the violation. In\nJon&#39;s Amazon scrape it was in one place on his server, which he could\nquickly fix assuming Amazon did not eliminate the ISBN from the URL, and he\ncould probably devise a creative fix even if they did eliminate the ISBN\nfrom the URL.\n\nURI Templates combined with a standard for providing the metadata needed to\ncompose URLs seems to provide what would be needed to keep peace with the\nspirit of URI Opacity and also be able to implement more advanced solutions.\nFYI, I&#39;m planning to do some research in that area for a project I&#39;m\ncurrently working on.\n\n-- \n-Mike Schinkel\nhttp://www.mikeschinkel.com/blogs/\nhttp://www.welldesignedurls.org\nhttp://atlanta-web.org - http://t.oolicio.us\n&quot;It never ceases to amaze how many people will proactively debate away\nattempts to improve the web...&quot;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
