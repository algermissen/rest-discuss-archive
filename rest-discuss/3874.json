I&#39;m not sure they&#39;re \nideal or optimal (how would we know?).\n\n\n&gt; It&#39;s fine for HTTP&#39;s interface to be used in a manner which is more\n&gt; specific than HTTP defines, if the two parties agree.  But when Roy\n&gt; talks about the difficulty of extension, what I think he means is that\n&gt; on the wilds of the Web, private agreements like that are problematic\n&gt; because they&#39;re not visible and require out-of-band agreement.  To be\n&gt; RESTful requires ensuring messages are self-descriptive and therefore\n&gt; declare any &quot;extended intentions&quot; (but unfortunately, HTTP 1.1 doesn&#39;t\n&gt; support doing that).\n\nIn work we call these &#39;bilateral exchanges&#39;. They have immediate \nutility and are attractive for that, but the costs rise as more \nparties want to communicate, yada yada.\n\nThe hardest part is getting the first three parties to agree to \nuniformity. The fourth party always thinks it&#39;s a no-brainer.\n\nI suspect the problem Alex really wants to fix is pinning down \ncontent models for exchanges of representations and not HTTP \nmethods, which are fine. That&#39;s work that can be tackled outside \nHTTP entirely, I&#39;m not sure about REST. It&#39;s also a main beef of \nmine with SOAP/WSDL. All that effort and we&#39;re not really any closer \nto having solid content models - I wish FIPA would get some \nmarketing dollars behind it :)\n\nBill de h�ra\n\n\n"}}
