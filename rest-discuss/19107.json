These\n&gt; instructions are made avail=\r\nable, say, as &quot;text/html&quot; (written\n&gt; description of what to do), &quot;applicati=\r\non/pdf&quot; (step-by-step instructions\n&gt; in illustrations) and &quot;application/mp4=\r\n&quot; (video showing what needs to be\n&gt; done).\n&gt;\n&gt; All the things basically rep=\r\nresent the same resource, the same content,\n&gt; in just different representat=\r\nions. There&#39;s two things that make me think:\n&gt;\n&gt; - As far as I understood c=\r\nontent negotiation by now, this is sort of a\n&gt; client-driven procedure: Cli=\r\nent provides a more or less lengthy weighted\n&gt; Accept: header, server deliv=\r\ners the kind of representation content type\n&gt; that seems to suit the client=\r\n best, based upon Accept:, language, and of\n&gt; course the kind of stuff the =\r\nserver is capable of providing, after all.\n&gt; While this is neat when making=\r\n client and server quietly make up whether\n&gt; to transfer and render image/g=\r\nif or image/png, it seems to fall short in\n&gt; a case as the one outlined bef=\r\nore. Here, I would kind of expect a\n&gt; standards based approach allowing for=\r\n the client to determine which kind\n&gt; of representations a server is capabl=\r\ne to provide, to by then know\n&gt; &quot;there&#39;s text, there&#39;s a pdf, and there&#39;s a=\r\n video clip of the same\n&gt; content, too&quot;. What is the best way of dealing wi=\r\nth such a requirement,\n&gt; both in terms of interoperability and in terms of =\r\n&quot;clean-ness of design&quot;?\n&gt;\n&gt; - Right now, I make use of Atom &lt;entry&gt;&#39;s and r=\r\nel=3D&quot;alternate&quot; links to\n&gt; keep such things together. Apart from at least =\r\n_feeling_ a bit strange\n&gt; (now the different &quot;representations&quot; of the same =\r\nthing are linked as\n&gt; &quot;alternate&quot; from an Atom &lt;entry&gt; which does not repre=\r\nsent but just\n&gt; describe that actual resource) I am left with another quest=\r\nion: Right\n&gt; now, with this approach, I easily can provide a client system =\r\nwith the\n&gt; information which media type representations are available for t=\r\nhat very\n&gt; resource. However this just (obviously) works whenever accessing=\r\n the\n&gt; &lt;entry&gt; resource first, to by then see a structure like\n&gt;\n&gt; http://.=\r\n../documentation/how-to-build-that-table&lt;UrlBlockedError.aspx&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; having l=\r\nink rel=3D&quot;alternate&quot; to\n&gt;\n&gt; http://.../documentation/how-to-build-that-tab=\r\nle/file.mp4&lt;UrlBlockedError.aspx&gt;\n&gt; http://.../documentation/how-to-build-t=\r\nhat-table/file.pdf&lt;UrlBlockedError.aspx&gt;\n&gt; http://.../documentation/how-to-=\r\nbuild-that-table/file.txt&lt;UrlBlockedError.aspx&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; which works. However, i=\r\nn such a situation, to tell which alternate\n&gt; representations are there, I =\r\nalways will have to access the\n&gt;\n&gt; http://.../documentation/how-to-build-th=\r\nat-table&lt;UrlBlockedError.aspx&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; resource first, which means that I have =\r\nto know this one. I so far\n&gt; haven&#39;t figured out an obvious, portable way h=\r\now to, in example starting\n&gt; out with the &quot;application/pdf&quot; representation,=\r\n tell that there are\n&gt; alternative media type representations available, as=\r\n well.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hmm. Maybe I am missing something essential / fundamental / triv=\r\nial\n&gt; about that, or I made a fundamental mistake in thinking about my\n&gt; re=\r\nsource design. Inspirations / thoughts, anyone?\n&gt;\n&gt; TIA and all the best,\n&gt;=\r\n Kristian\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
