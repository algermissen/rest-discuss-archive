You mention that\n&gt; &gt; they &#39;tend to be applications&#39; ... do you mean flash games and the\n&gt; &gt; like?\n&gt;\n&gt; No. I don&#39;t mean that. Though that would be another example.\n&gt;\n&gt; I mean applications that don&#39;t conform at all to REST. There are quite\n&gt; a few. Hotmail for example? It&#39;s not very RESTfull is it?\n\nor gMail, or Yahoo! mail ...\n\nVirtually every e-commerce site ...\n\nIt&#39;s probably easier to list the RESTful ones!\n\n&gt;\n&gt; There are a lot of examples of non-RESTfull webapps, or at least\n&gt; webapps that are only dimly RESTfull. These examples tend to be apps\n&gt; that are trying to mimick a desktop app.\n\nNot necessarily. It is relatively easy for a simple app to be (nearly\n/ accidentally) RESTful (think twitter) but without deliberate effort,\nthe more complexity ... the less RESTfulness.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Seems like a good time to point out a(nother) oft-neglected constraint\n&gt; &gt; of REST, Code-On-Demand:\n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_1_7&gt;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes. Quite right. I&#39;ve been advocating it here for quite a while.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t think this excuses pushing architectural behaviour into such\n&gt; code though. I may be mistaken but I don&#39;t think you&#39;d find Roy\n&gt; advocating that either.\n\nLet&#39;s not forget that this is stipulated as an optional constraint:\n\n&quot;However, it also reduces visibility, and thus is only an optional\nconstraint within REST.&quot;\n\n&gt;\n&gt; What javascript and flash *are* useful for is user experience (AJAX\n&gt; driven apps etc...) and also things that the browser absolutely can&#39;t\n&gt; do such as reading from a camera.\n&gt;\n\nAgreed, but I fear that there is much injudicious use of AJAX. If you\nare Google, you can afford the overhead of maintaining gMail, but I\ncan see many AJAX-driven sites becoming swiftly unmaintainable.\n\nI think that del.icio.us balances well between RESTfulness and AJAX usage.\n\nRegards,\nAlan Dean\nhttp://thoughtpad.net/alan-dean\n\n"}}
