In both cases you’re\n&gt;    A&gt; exchanging personalised messages.\n&gt;\n&gt;As I understand the spec, you can cache authenticated responses, if the\n&gt;public directive is set. Which isn&#39;t useful for the page itself, but\n&gt;might be for parts of the page that are loaded dynamically.\n&gt;\n\nI always thought of this as useful for users authenticated site-wide, \naccessing static, public pages on a site.  With an Authentication header \nin the request, caching must be explicit, otherwise each user will get \ntheir own individual copy of non-personalized pages, since the default \ncache behavior is for all content requested with Authentication headers \nto be treated as &quot;Cache-Control: private&quot;.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;But the point was more directed at cookies: if cookies are present, the\n&gt;response isn&#39;t cacheable.\n&gt;\n\nYou can send a &quot;Cache-Control: no-cache=Set-Cookie&quot; header to allow \ncaching of a page, but not its Set-Cookie header.  I think I read that in \nreality, that&#39;s how most caches behave anyway -- stripping the Set-Cookie \nheader regardless, while otherwise caching the response (unless no-cache \nis set).\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n\n"}}
