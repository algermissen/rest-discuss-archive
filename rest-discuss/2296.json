Resource orientation might be the\nname of that method.\n\nJackson problem frames are useful for selecting a method based\non the type of problem.  For those not familiar, the Information\nFrame is about content-management, the Static Information Frame\nis about read-only resources.  REST and resource orientation seem\nwell fitted to both.\n\nThe Control Frame is about making\nsomething meet its specification, and I interpret Roy to say in\nthe dissertation that REST is less applicable to control problems\nthan information problems.  I think REST is also quite applicable\nto Workpieces Frame problems, in which we are attempting to build\nan electronic artifact such as a specification or a contract or\nan order or a piece of electronic art.\n\nWalden\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Sam Hunting [mailto:shunting@...]\n&gt; Sent: Friday, August 30, 2002 12:57 PM\n&gt; To: Jeffrey Winter\n&gt; Cc: Mark Baker; bhaugen32; rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [rest-discuss] When REST should and should not be used Was:\n&gt; Evidence\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, 30 Aug 2002, Jeffrey Winter wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; P.S. I think a lot of the current discussion focuses on \n&gt; &quot;how to do \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; RPC in REST&quot; rather than &quot;use cases for which REST is a clear \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; advantage&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yep.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think this mischaracterisizes the original discussion a \n&gt; &gt; bit.  The underlying issue was more along the lines of how \n&gt; &gt; to *avoid doing* RPC in REST.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If there are &quot;use cases for which REST is a clear advantage,&quot; this \n&gt; &gt; would imply that there are cases where it isn&#39;t.  What are those\n&gt; &gt; cases?\n&gt; \n&gt; Well? What are some use cases where REST should not be used? Since I&#39;m\n&gt; advocating a RESTful implementation of Linda tuple spaces, I&#39;d like to\n&gt; know if my use cases falls into this category!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Understanding what those boundaries are (and I can&#39;t think of any) \n&gt; &gt; would be very illuminating.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hmmm... No cases where REST should not be used? This sounds \n&gt; like religious\n&gt; enthusiasm to me....\n&gt; \n&gt; Sam Hunting\n&gt; eTopicality, Inc.\n&gt; \n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; -------------\n&gt; &quot;Turn your searching experience into a finding experience.&quot;(tm)\n&gt; \n&gt; Topic map consulting and training: www.etopicality.com\n&gt; Free open source topic map tools:  www.goose-works.org\n&gt; \n&gt; XML Topic Maps: Creating and Using Topic Maps for the Web.\n&gt; Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-74960-2.\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; -------------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
