If the URI referenced the soap service itself, then that particular\n&gt; URI wouldn&#39;t need to be part of the soap message. Any data needed for the\n&gt; operation would already be bundled in the message, but then we get into the\n&gt; whole non-addressable data issue.\n\nRight. I think that we&#39;re in violent agreement. You can use any URI to\ntalk to a SOAP service but unless your SOAP toolkit can extract\ninformation from the URI the way an HTTP toolkit can, then you haven&#39;t\nsolved the addressability problem. You still need to encode the\naddressing data in the SOAP message in some service-specific fashion.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
