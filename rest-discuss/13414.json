Th=\r\ne output of REST-* is not meant to be an\n&gt; academic exercise. We want to cr=\r\neate specifications that can be\n&gt; implemented and solve specific problems. =\r\nWhile our goal is to be\n&gt; architecturally pure, software, in general, is ve=\r\nry rarely\n&gt; architecturely pure when in its final form. As a result, initia=\r\nl\n&gt; iterations (and even final ones) maybe a mix of both HTTP and\n&gt; REST-ce=\r\nntric designs. Remember, WE JUST STARTED!\n&gt;\n&gt; This, IMO, does not mean we s=\r\nhould change the name of the site or to\n&gt; coin a new buzzword. The goal we =\r\nare striving for is to be RESTful.\n&gt; REST is our ideal.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think what we=\r\n can do is to make it clear what parts of each\n&gt; specification aren&#39;t restf=\r\nul and more HTTP-centric. Maybe even a\n&gt; specific very visible link &quot;What&#39;s=\r\n RESTful, What&#39;s just HTTP?&quot; for each\n&gt; specification would be warranted. T=\r\nhis link is where the spec designers\n&gt; could state what they think is restf=\r\nul or not, and where people could\n&gt; post links to blogs and articles that d=\r\niscuss what is and isn&#39;t restful\n&gt; about our specifications.\n&gt;\n\n=A0In your =\r\nown words, you are expecting that &quot;even final ones maybe a\nmix of both HTTP=\r\n and REST-centric designs&quot; and you&#39;ll &quot;make it clear\nwhat parts of each spe=\r\ncification aren&#39;t restfull&quot; by even put in a\n&quot;very visible link &quot;What&#39;s RES=\r\nTful, What&#39;s just HTTP?&quot;&quot;\n\nSo it seems clear to you that the intention of y=\r\nour effort is about to\ncreate something that will be a mix(!) of REST and n=\r\non-REST HTTP\nspecifications to some kind of midleware architecture design(!=\r\n).\n\nSo why do you insist in a name like REST-* ??? You know of course that\n=\r\nin IT jargon, the &quot;*&quot; is interpreted as &quot;everything&quot;\n[http://www.googleguid=\r\ne.com/wildcard_operator.html] so your name will\nappear to mean something li=\r\nke &quot;Everything REST&quot;, which is, in the\nlight of your own words, misleading =\r\nif not fraudulent, as you know\nthat at the very best you aim to try to spec=\r\nify something\n&quot;Restish+Httpish&quot;.\n\nREST-* is without a doubt a marketing buz=\r\nzword, created as that, and\nwhere you (not you personally, I mean, but the =\r\nauthors of the project)\nwill try to squeeze everything that fits your purpo=\r\nse of creating some\n&quot;standards&quot; that could put RedHat as a market lead in a=\r\n area where\nyour products fit, and you don&#39;t care if it&#39;s REST or just HTTP=\r\nish as\nlong it is perceived as &quot;Everything REST&quot;.\n\nWhy don&#39;t you reflect in=\r\n the name that dual personality of REST +\nHTTP-centric designs that you cle=\r\narly assume it is? Coin a new\nbuzzword if you have to, at least you won&#39;t b=\r\ne misleading.\n\nOr call REST-- meaning REST-less-less.\n\n"}}
