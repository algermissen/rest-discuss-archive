Especially I am\n&gt; wondering wheth=\r\ner it is enough for the user agent to say\n&gt; \n&gt;   Accept: application/atom+x=\r\nml;type=3Dfeed\n&gt; \n&gt; or whether the Accept header should include the user ag=\r\nent\ncapabilities\n&gt; regarding the individual order entries, e.g.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Acce=\r\npt: application/orderlist\n\nI consider media types as syntax, not semantics.=\r\n If\napplication/orderlist really has different syntax than\napplication/atom=\r\n+xml, then, OK I guess. But it probably shouldn&#39;t.\nInstead, the semantics o=\r\nf the resource are described by the @rel\nattribute the user-agent discovere=\r\nd and followed (in combination with\ndata and its arrangement in the respons=\r\ne, including further links in the\nresponse). Your resource could just as ea=\r\nsily return &quot;text/html&quot; with\nthe same semantics and, if the client understo=\r\nod HTML, could be\nprocessed meaningfully, in which case the client would em=\r\nit &quot;Accept:\napplication/atom+xml, text/html&quot;.\n\nIn other words, the Accept h=\r\neader says, &quot;these are the representation\nformats I am prepared to parse fo=\r\nr a resource of the &#39;new-orders&#39;\nrelation&quot;. A media type of &quot;application/or=\r\nderlist&quot; *can* be used in that\nway, but couples too tightly, IMO. There are=\r\n plenty of &quot;list-y&quot; media\ntypes out there already--does a list of orders re=\r\nally differ\nsignificantly in structure (not just differ in @rel&#39;s) from a l=\r\nist of,\nsay, sale items? Atom has succeeded, IMO, because it is specific in=\r\n\nsyntax (&quot;feed&quot; =3D list of items in order, with some fixed fields) and\ngen=\r\neric in semantics (doesn&#39;t matter what you&#39;re listing). I wrote Shoji\n[1] b=\r\necause I wanted to hit that sweet spot for a &quot;catalog&quot; syntax\n(entities and=\r\n overlapping lists of entity URI&#39;s) that was independent of\nthe semantic--I=\r\n wrote it for Etsy procurement, but it could equally be\nused for representi=\r\nng scientific lab work. If the syntax fits, wear it.\n\n\nRobert Brewer\nfumanc=\r\nhu@...\n\n[1] http://www.aminus.org/rbre/shoji/shoji-draft-01.txt\n\n"}}
