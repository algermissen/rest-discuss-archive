I think Mike is\n&gt; overestimating, but that is another mail.\n\nGo do some homework re: scalability considerations on network servers of various\nkinds.  The constraining factor for our buddies at KN is how many open sockets and\nhow much data can reasonably be handled by / pumped through various OS kernels,\netc.  It&#39;s network protocol stack considerations.  A Web-based service has the\nsame *fundamental* constraints as any other TCP-based service;  the problem is\ncompounded by various factors, but scalability in terms of users / machine is\ngoing to be same-order for a Web-based solution and any other TCP-based solution,\nall other things being equal.  (UDP offers some advantages, but just as many\ndisadvantages.  Our event notification protocol at Activerse was a sort of\nmucked-up HTTP-alike over UDP, and its a design decision I&#39;ve regretted ever since\nthen.)\n\n&gt; Even if Mike is correct, you are looking at at\n&gt; least an order of magnitude difference in\n&gt; deployment costs between the two systems.\n\nNo offense, but this just isn&#39;t true.  Any differences are functions of the\nvarious HTTP implementations, not anything having to do with HTTP itself.  Any\nTCP-based solution is going to hit roughly the same limits on the same hardware.\n\n&gt; !!!!What is most of the recent discussion about!?\n\nHow to *use HTTP* --- not how to fill in the holes.  It&#39;s a subtle point.  You&#39;ll\nget it eventually.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; For the basic terrorist_or_not.com, HTTP is a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; great protocol, but, as we have seen, REST\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is not.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You want to run that through by me again?  REST is the overall architectural\n&gt; &gt; style of HTTP.  I don&#39;t see how you distinguish the two.\n&gt;\n&gt; Terrorist_or_not.com uses RPC to deliver the\n&gt; queries.  The target of the POST is a function not\n&gt; a resource.\n\n(a) The point is that REST is not a protocol, HTTP is a protocol\n(b) REST is the architectural style of HTTP + URI\n(c) If HTTP is a great protocol, then REST is a great style ;-)\n(d) If you&#39;re using HTTP to do RPCs, you aren&#39;t using HTTP\n(e) Instead, you&#39;re tunneling some other protocol *through* HTTP\n(f) If you&#39;re tunneling other protocols through HTTP, you just don&#39;t get HTTP\n(g) If you don&#39;t get HTTP, you can&#39;t understand REST\n\n&gt; I think the format of the POST should me\n&gt; multipart/form-data.  XML-RPC folks prefer XML-RPC\n&gt; and SOAP people prefer SOAP envelopes.\n&gt; These are all RPC.\n\nI think Mark&#39;s perspective --- certainly my own perspective --- is that the\nXML-RPC and SOAP communities and the RPC-oriented &quot;web services&quot; efforts that we\nsee all over the place today --- largely represent the same kind of sadly futile\ntail-chasing that lots of *very smart people* in our industry are prone to getting\ninto every few years with new technology.  DCE.  CORBA.  PUSH.  All of these\nthings are interesting, but they&#39;ve all ended up in a kind of complexity death\nspiral that absolutely limits their proliferation.  The Web, by contrast, is all\nabout maximum proliferation.  Given the Web as an existance proof, we should look\nat it to learn what characteristics it has that influence adoption, scalability,\netc.\n\n&gt; If you do, explain how to make\n&gt; terrorist_or_not.com non-RPC and why it would be\n&gt; better that way.\n\nI&#39;ll take that challenge.  Next message.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
