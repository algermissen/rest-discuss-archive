Suddenly you impose having an xml parser and\n&gt; other semantics in a container format and get dragged into\n&gt; wrapping your content-types within yet another content-type to\n&gt; manage.\n\nSure. All I’m saying is that people *will* misuse it and trying\nto ward that off is not going to achieve anything.\n\n&gt; The so-called reuse of content-types that atom provides is an\n&gt; illusion as  your entities will still need to exist in a format\n&gt; you have to define.\n\nI wasn’t referring to that. The same thing that applies to HTTP\nmessages applies to Atom Entries: to maximise serendipity the\ncontent needs to be in a commonly understood format, not an\napplication-specific one. AtomPub changes nothing about this.\n\n&gt; Saying the complexity is being absorbed by the frameworks is\n&gt; like saying  transactions will magically all scale because we\n&gt; have WS-AtomicTransactions. It&#39;s not true, it requires more and\n&gt; more layers of tools and toolkits and increase the price you\n&gt; pay for your first shot.\n\nJust to be clear, I never said any of that. I like AtomPub\nbecause it’s a nice protocol to directly code against, without\nany abstraction layers.\n\n&gt; Be it in flash, XHR or plain Html forms, atom is not supported,\n&gt; and it  should probably never be.\n\nI wouldn’t be so quick to make that judgement…\n\n&gt; If you want to pass atom because the format makes sense and the\n&gt; client negotiated, that is quite fine. If you pass everything\n&gt; wrapped in ATOM saying that somehow putting an entity in an xml\n&gt; feed is fine, in the name of so-called commoditization of\n&gt; frameworks (something that companies that have been known to\n&gt; *create* the WS-* mess are now pushing very hardly for), and\n&gt; not even providing other alternate content types that make\n&gt; sense, is going against the simplicity and capability discovery\n&gt; that REST support out of the box.\n\nPeople have been abusing HTTP in that exact fashion for a very\nlong time. It’s harmful, but to the perpetrators more than the\nwider web as a whole.\n\n&gt; Would you wrap a jpeg file in an atom entry and base64 it? So\n&gt; why do it with anything else but namespaced composable xml\n&gt; languages, of which very few are actually composeable?\n\nNo, of course not. AtomPub is explicitly designed to allow using\nany Content-Type, not just Atom.\n\nThat’s not at all how I meant my remark anyway.\n\nWhat I meant is that it’s RESTful systems work better when\nrepresentations are of generic media types, even when the generic\nmedia type is not an exact fit for the application and may be\nmore complex than the application’s immediate needs demand. Just\nin the same way, having fewer application protocols is better\neven when the protocol in question may not be an exact fit for\neach application and might be more complex than the application’s\nimmediate needs require.\n\nOf course, this doesn’t mean that application/octet-stream is the\nbest choice of media type. So too does having fewer protocols not\nmean that using a single one for every last thing is a good idea.\n\nBoth absence and abundance of diversity are harmful.\n\nAs for Assaf’s comparison to WS-*, the fact is that it is both\npractical to write code directly against AtomPub (which was never\neven a consideration in the design of WS-*) *and* likely to\nachieve very good interoperability on the first try. (The interop\nmeetups of early implementers demonstrated that very clearly; the\nmajor pain point was HTTP Auth, not AtomPub per se.) Comparing\nAtomPub to the WS-* stack is therefore a mere rhetorical device;\nin absolute terms, there is a vast chasm in complexity between\nthe two.\n\nAnd I think AtomPub hits a sweetspot in that respect. It is\ncomplex enough to be useful for *a LOT* of use cases (a lot more\nthan a simple application/x-www-url-encoded protocol would be),\nbut it still doesn’t try cover them *all*, and in this way it\ndoes – IMO anyway – avoid being prohibitively complex for the\nsimple cases, while offering them the advantages of conformity.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
