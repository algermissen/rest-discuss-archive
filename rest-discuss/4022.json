(I wonder, though, how\n&gt; &gt; much this really has to do with REST.)\n\nIt&#39;s good news that irony is not dead!\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Did you realize that you used the word &quot;hat&quot; where you probably\n&gt; &gt; meant to use the word &quot;what&quot;?\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, I meant &quot;what&quot; sorry about that.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What did you mean to identify with that word (or should I say &quot;hat\n&gt; &gt; were you trying to identify...&quot;?).  Does the context of that sentence\n&gt; &gt; affect the *architecture* of the English language?\n&gt; \n&gt; I tried, but I admit that I don&#39;t get what you are up to. Is this an\n&gt; analogy I don&#39;t get?\n\nI guess I don&#39;t see the relation between a &quot;typo&quot; (&quot;hat&quot; for &quot;what&quot;) and\nquestioning what Roy meant by the word &quot;author&quot; is in a sentence.\n\nThat is, by &quot;author&quot; do we mean the &quot;coiner&quot; of the URI, who inserts that\ndata into a document, or the &quot;issuing authority&quot; of the URI, that serves\nup a representation of the resource identified by that the URI (in\ncontext). Both? Some third meanning?\n\nWalden, are you saying the question is meaningless and cannot be asked, at\nleast within the context of a REST architectural discussion?\n\nThat the word &quot;author&quot; is a typo for some other correct word?\n\n(Thanks to all for a very enlightening discussion.)\n\n&gt; &gt; : &quot;Roy T. Fielding&quot; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; :\n&gt; &gt; : &gt; We have no way of knowing whether the URI, as used by the author,\n&gt; &gt; : &gt; is intended to identify the person, their home page, or some other\n&gt; &gt; : &gt; aspect of past responses that the author simply had no other URI\n&gt; &gt; : &gt; to reference.  That&#39;s why it is useful to look at the text inside\n&gt; &gt; : &gt; the anchor, both here and in other authors&#39; use of the URI, and\n&gt; &gt; : &gt; any other metadata that might be laying about.\n&gt; &gt; :\n&gt; &gt; :\n&gt; &gt; : Roy, hat is the meaning of &#39;author&#39; in what you write? Is it\n&gt; &gt; :\n&gt; &gt; : - the person that &#39;issued&#39; the URI in the first place (&quot;naming authority&quot;)\n&gt; &gt; :\n&gt; &gt; :\n&gt; &gt; : - or the person that used the URI as the value of the href attribute?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSam Hunting\neTopicality, Inc.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCo-editor:  ISO Reference Model for Topic Maps \n  Topic map consulting and training: www.etopicality.com\nFree open source topic map tools:  www.gooseworks.org\n  XML Topic Maps: Creating and Using Topic Maps for the Web.\nAddison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-74960-2.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}}
