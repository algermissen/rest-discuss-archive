Here&#39;s the link to the workshop report:\n\n http://www.w3.org/2007/04/wsec_report\n\nAs the organizer of the Workshop, my goal was to find out what more, if anything, could be done to standardize enterprise software. My interest in this topic dates to 1990 and the Multivendor Integration Architecture project sponsored by NTT.  The ideas is that if enterprise software could achieve a comparable level of standardization as the Web, the benefits to business, industry, and society would be even more significant than what&#39;s been achieved with the Web.  In retrospect, this may have been a slightly exaggerated view, since the Web has been shown to significantly benefit society beyond the simple economic equations involved in reducing the cost of email, publishing, and information sharing.\n\nIt started during a W3C Advisory Committee meeting when I participated in a panel discussion on where should W3C be in 2010 ( this was Dec. &#39;05).  I was trying to make the case for increased investment in Web services, since my company (IONA at the time) had joined the W3C in early 2000 specifically for the purpose of supporting the standardization of SOAP.  I had also served as an editor of the W3C Web Services Architecture specification, and in that context participated in the intense &quot;HTTP vs SOAP&quot; discussions.\n\nI made sure to invite as many REST proponents to the Workshop as Web services proponents, since the REST proponents were (and still are of course) making strong arguments that WS-* is unnecessary.  \n\nThe result was a few recommendations to improve the Web services standardization process (adopting a JMS mapping, which has happened, and initiating a core WS working group, which I think still hasn&#39;t), and a general feeling that the worlds of REST and Web services were very distinct and separate.  \n\nSome of the presenters, most notably Noah Mendelsohn, described co-existence strategies.  It was also noted that WS-Addressing had features that broke REST, and that WSDL 2 and SOAP 1.2 had included features that were more REST-friendly.  But no vendors seemed interested in implementing them.\n\nThis is where I would suggest Red Hat/JBoss start if they are truly interested in REST.  Implement the RESTful capabilities of WSDL 2 and SOAP 1.2.  That will bring Web services closer to REST.\n\nThe other suggestion, i.e., to add WS-* style specifications to REST was debated also, but there was not strong interest in this. The feeling was more that these capabilities have a place in the overall scheme of things, but on the other side of the RESTful interfaces. They are not things to be added to HTTP for example. \n\nPersonally I tend to look at the world of IT as distinguished between &quot;scale up&quot; or mainframe style application architectures, and &quot;scale out&quot; or HTTP based (RESTful more or less) architectures.  I believe the IT world will eventually move to the HTTP scale out architectures, but existing systems will need to be redesigned, and this will take a long time.  Meanwhile, WS-* seem to provide value in this environment, as several Web services users confirmed during the workshop.\n\nFinally, as someone who helped get Web services started, I have to say their adoption has been somewhat lacking, in particular the document-oriented style has not been widely implemented, and the result of vendor adoption has been to design annotations and attributes embedded in .NET languages and Java, so developers don&#39;t have to use XML directly.  This seems a result of vendors continuing to focus on competing with each other over for developer hearts and minds rather than focusing on delivering the benefits of a new, and potentially breaking approach to distributed computing.  \n\nAt least two standards bodies already exist for dealing with extensions to HTTP and proposal for new specifications, and they have not done so. I don&#39;t see the need for a new organization in this area, and I don&#39;t see industry consensus around the need for adding Web services style spec to REST.  \n\nI also sympathize with Roy and others who have worked so diligently to promote and educate the industry to think differently about distributed computing - this should be supported rather than diluted.\n\nEric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\nFrom: johnzabroski &lt;johnzabroski@...&gt;\nTo: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Sunday, September 20, 2009 2:44:19 AM\nSubject: [rest-discuss] Re: We&#39;re listening:  REST-* changes\n\n  \n--- In rest-discuss@ yahoogroups. com, Bill Burke &lt;bburke@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Imagine if the same tact was taken with the coined phrase \n&gt; Object-Oriented- Programming?

Again, Roy&#39;s comparison to IBM web services is spot-on.\n\nAnyway, I doubt very much this crap matters at the bits and bytes level, and what most businesses would benefit from is an open source, free/libre service bus that competes with billion-dollar stalwarts like Progress.  I just don&#39;t see your middleware standard being a huge deal, certainly not important enough to earn the name REST-*.  At least the Amazon folks are like &quot;REST-DB&quot;.
