In a similar vein, this was my\nsuggested solution to a Meta-Query header conversation over in the\ndistributed-registry list.  My only fear would be that using URIs in fields\nlike Accept and Content-Type would break many existing applications.  One\nway we could maintain backwards compatibility would be to add another MIME\ntype like &quot;alt/uri&quot;.  When this type was present, it would tell the\napplication to look for another header or headers.  The name of the\nheader(s) would be specific to the protocol.  For instance, in HTTP, the\nMIME type might indicate the presence of a header called &quot;Content-Type-URI:&quot;\nor some such.\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\nFrom: &quot;Vincent D Murphy&quot; &lt;vdm@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Friday, February 28, 2003, at 01:32 AM, S.
