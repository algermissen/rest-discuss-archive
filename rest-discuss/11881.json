The correct name now is &quot;Internet media type&quot;,\nafter the media type system was detached from MIME with RFC 4288.\nThere&#39;s a relevant historical note in it;\n\n      The media type registration process was initially defined for\n      registering media types for use in the context of the asynchronous\n      Internet mail environment.  In this mail environment there is a\n      need to limit the number of possible media types, to increase the\n      likelihood of interoperability when the capabilities of the remote\n      mail system are not known.  As media types are used in new\n      environments in which the proliferation of media types is not a\n      hindrance to interoperability, the original procedure proved\n      excessively restrictive and had to be generalized.  This was\n      initially done in [RFC2048], but the procedure defined there was\n      still part of the MIME document set.  The media type specification\n      and registration procedure has now been moved to this separate\n      document, to make it clear that it is independent of MIME.\n\n      It may be desirable to restrict the use of media types to specific\n      environments or to prohibit their use in other environments.  This\n      revision attempts for the first time to incorporate such\n      restrictions into media type registrations in a systematic way.\n      See Section 4.9 for additional discussion.\n\nMark.\n\nOn Tue, Dec 23, 2008 at 8:20 AM, Steve Bjorg &lt;steveb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I did a cheat sheet summarizing my current understanding of MIME\n&gt; types.
