Originally, the client had a series of URIs that more or\nless\n&gt; mapped to several of the URIs above.  However, this was getting confusing,\n&gt; since I needed additional things like edit windows and\n&gt;\n&gt; /client?uri={uri}\n&gt;     Auth-GET returns the appropriate resource representation\n&gt;     {uri} must be one of the URIs in the second group above. The\n&gt;     &quot;/{id}/access&quot; URI would be the &quot;main&quot; URI, which would return\n&gt;     the entry page, main menu, etc.\n[snip]\n&gt; In general, the idea is that the appropriate screen according to the value\n&gt; of {uri} is returned.  For clarity, look at the following examples:\n&gt;\n&gt;     GET /client?uri={/{id}/access}\n&gt;         returns the main menu options\n[snip]\n\nWell, it occurs to me that there are a few  design problems here...\n\nFirst, suppose I had an RNA address of http://example.com/rna/seairth and\nthe client software was at http://example.com/rnaclient.  According to the\nabove stuff, the &#39;entry-point&#39; would be:\n\nhttp://example.com/rnaclient?uri=http://example.com/rna/seairth/access\n\nFrankly, this isn&#39;t very user-friendly.  First, the URL is way to long to\nhave to type in.  Second, it requires me to know/remember the URI of my\n&quot;access&quot; resource.  So what would be some solutions?  So far, I have thought\nof the following (along with their limitations):\n\n1) The client could have a &quot;default&quot; URI, but this would only be useful\nwhere a particular copy of the client was being used by one person only.\n\n2) Instead, one could use just the RNA Address\n(http://example.com/rna/seairth) and the client would auto-append the\n&quot;access&quot; bit.  If the server returned a 404, it could then try other\npossibilities, effectively hunting for the interface.  This solution is not\nvery flexible, since all it would take is a particular inplementation to\nchange the path slightly (e.g. &quot;client-access&quot;) in order for the client to\nfail discovery.\n\n3) If no uri is given, show a simple form requesting the appropriate access\nURI.  Once given, store as a cookie to auto-fill the textbox in future.\nProblems: not portable, still requires knowledge of access URI, etc.\n\n4) Double up the access URI and the RNA address.  Since the only purpose of\nthe access URI is to return an xml document, it would be possible to use\nconneg on a GET of the RNA Address.  This way, a user would only have to\nknow their own RNA Address (which they would anyhow).  This could be coupled\nwith #3 above, where the coookie bit would only be a convenience.  The down\nside is that I&#39;m not too crazy about overloading the RNA Address like this\n(purely from a technical POV; I think end-users would be oblivious and\ntherefore fine with it).\n\n5) Move the client to be under the RNA Address, effectively replacing the\n&quot;access URI&quot;.  Through conneg, it would still be possible to return the\noriginal XML document from the client URI so that &quot;thick&quot; clients could\nstill have access.  The main advantage here is that the URI would be\nmemorable (e.g. http://example.com/rna/seairth/client).  However, it seems\nsomewhat like overkill to pass entire URIs in the query string, esp. since\nit would be unlikely that you would use the client to access any RNA address\nother than the one it was under.  On the other hand, I could be wrong here.\nFor instance, this would allow one to customize the look-and-feel of the\nclient program, then access other RNA Addresses while continuing to keep\nthat look-and-feel.  When accessing another site, you would have to use\nsomething akin to the original syntax (e.g.\nhttp://example.com/rna/seairth/client?uri=http://example.com/rna/bob), but\nit&#39;s probably fine at that point.\n\n\n\nThe other problem is that the current approach would require a GET of the\n&quot;access URI&quot; resource for every request in order to determine what the\nactual uri parameter is pointing to.  For instance, in order to understand\nthe following:\n\n    GET /client/addform?uri=http://example.com/rna/seairth/agreements\n\nI would have to first do a GET on the &quot;access URI&quot;.  Now, given the above\nURI, the access URI isn&#39;t known (unless using solution #4 above).  It seems\nto me that there are two possible approaches (other than #4):\n\n1) To change the structure so that everything pointed to by the access URI\nwas under the access URI (e.g. /{id}/access/agreements,\n/{id}/access/settings, etc.), which doesn&#39;t seem to be a very good solution.\nWhile it may give access to the &quot;access URI&quot; (in a not-so-opaque manner), it\nstill means that an additional GET is required to understand the bits\nunderneath it.\n\n2) To go Chuck&#39;s way, sort of.  He suggested:\n\n&gt;    GET /client/menu?id={id}\n&gt;    GET /client/settingsviewer?id={id}\n&gt;    GET /client/settingseditor?id={id}\n&gt;    GET /client/agreementsviewer?id={id}\n&gt;    GET /client/agreementscreator?id={id}\n\nWhere I took {id} as I meant it in the original post ( &quot;something like\n&#39;seairth&#39; or &#39;bob&#39; or &#39;cmhinson&#39;&quot;). Instead, they could be:\n\n    GET /client/menu?id={uri}\n    GET /client/settingsviewer?id={uri}\n    GET /client/settingseditor?id={uri}\n    GET /client/agreementsviewer?id={uri}\n    GET /client/agreementscreator?id={uri}\n\nIn other words, when you get back the initial &quot;access URI&quot; list, they are\ntranslated into meaningful (to the client) URIs that would no longer require\nadditional accesses to the &quot;access URI&quot; list.  For instance, a request gets\nback the list of agreements:\n\n    http://example.com/rna/seairth/agreements/123\n    http://example.com/rna/seairth/agreements/456\n\nThis would be translated into client-specific URIs looking something like:\n\n\nhttp://example.com/rnaclient/agreementviewer?uri=http://example.com/rna/seairth/agreements/123\n\nhttp://example.com/rnaclient/agreementeditor?uri=http://example.com/rna/seairth/agreements/123\n\n\nhttp://example.com/rnaclient/agreementviewer?uri=http://example.com/rna/seairth/agreements/456\n\nhttp://example.com/rnaclient/agreementeditor?uri=http://example.com/rna/seairth/agreements/456\n\nThe uri is still intact (and totally opaque) and the client program still\nimplicitly knows what the resource at the other end of the URI is (though it\nshould probably validate anyhow).\n\n\nSo, for the second problem, I&#39;d be likely to go with option #2.  For the\nfirst problem, I am leanding towards #5, but am unsure.  Any thoughts?\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
