Alexander Jacobson&quot; &lt;alex@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I like your version of the format quite a lot.\n&gt; &gt; The only thing I&#39;d like to see in it that is\n&gt; &gt; missing is some way of finding out what\n&gt; &gt; content-types are available via\n&gt; &gt; content-negotiation.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s necessary, though.  A client should submit to the server\n&gt; the list of content-types that it understands (i.e. &quot;Accept&quot; header) and the\n&gt; server should choose from that list or return an appropriate error response.\n&gt; What value would it be for a client to get back a list of content-types that\n&gt; it didn&#39;t understand?\n&gt;\n&gt; Further, I should point out that the format I suggest does allow a server to\n&gt; return something like:\n&gt;\n&gt; GET accept: text/html, text/*, */*\n&gt; GET accept-encoding: compress, gzip\n&gt;\n&gt; Basically, just about any request header could be specified.  The example in\n&gt; my original post were just a sampling for demonstration and not the complete\n&gt; list of possibilities.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regarding the options header on GET, I like that\n&gt; &gt; as a concept, but the practice makes me nervous.\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d like to avoid a proliferation of file formats\n&gt; &gt; for this sort of thing.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t understand your concern here.  As it is OPTIONS is woefully\n&gt; underutilized.  It makes sense that in this emerging world of new metadata\n&gt; constructs, esp. wrt web services, the OPTIONS feature could fit the bill\n&gt; nicely (at least for some uses).  Regardless of the suggested header, anyone\n&gt; could return any response-entity of any content-type for OPTIONS right now.\n&gt; There is no way we can avoid that.  What the header does is allow a resource\n&gt; to indicate that metadata is available via OPTIONS in certain formats.  This\n&gt; is more an ability to actively inform the client of OPTIONS abilities than\n&gt; it is a method of proliferating multiple content-types when using OPTIONS.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt; Seairth Jacobs\n&gt; seairth@...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
