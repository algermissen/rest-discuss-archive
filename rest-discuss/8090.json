Obviously, a \nRESTful=\r\n system should not require a MOVE verb, and the \noperation can be carried o=\r\nut as follows (assume that the \nrepresentation already exists):\n\n--&gt;\nGET /f=\r\noo.txt\n\n&lt;--\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nETag: &quot;hash&quot;\nContent-Type: text/plain\nContent-L=\r\nength: 16\n\nthis is the body\n\n--&gt;\nPUT /bar.txt\nIf-None-Match: *\nContent-Type=\r\n: text/plain\nContent-Length: 16\n\nthis is the body\n\n&lt;--\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created=\r\n\n\n--&gt;\nDELETE /foo.txt\nIf-Match: &quot;hash&quot;\n\n&lt;--\nHTTP/1.1 204 No Content\n\n\nThat&#39;=\r\ns fine. The question I am wrestling with at the moment is &quot;how \ndoes the cl=\r\nient tell the server to redirect requests from /foo.txt \nto /bar.txt (eithe=\r\nr temporarily or permanently)?&quot;\n\nI had a look into the Atom Publishing Prot=\r\nocol to see if this is a \nmatter that they have thought about, but I can&#39;t =\r\nfind any reference.\n\nI had feedback that you might use the Location header =\r\n- but I don&#39;t \nmuch like the feel of that as it is a response header.\n\nWher=\r\ne my thinking is right now is that the server could support a PUT \nof Conte=\r\nnt-Type message/http, in the following manner:\n\n--&gt;\nPUT /foo.txt\nContent-Ty=\r\npe: message/http\nContent-Length: 49\n\nHTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently\nLocatio=\r\nn: /bar.txt\n\n&lt;--\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\n\n--&gt;\nGET /foo.txt\n\n&lt;--\nHTTP/1.1 301 M=\r\noved Permanently\nLocation: /bar.txt\n\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nRegards,\nAlan Dea=\r\nn\nhttp://thoughtpad.net/who/alan-dean/\n\n\n"}}
