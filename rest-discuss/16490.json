And if by &quot;standardized&quot;, you mean IANA\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; registration, =\r\nthat&#39;s a very narrow view of standards, given that\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; there are many sta=\r\nndards organizations in the world.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; IANA is not a standards =\r\nbody, it&#39;s a registry, which recognizes\n&gt; &gt;&gt; standards published by any ent=\r\nity that claims to be a standards body.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; On the Web, IANA registration =\r\nis absolutely a requirement -- how can\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you square your claim that it i=\r\nsn&#39;t with Roy&#39;s clear definition of the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; term?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Self-descript=\r\nive means that the type is registered and the registry\n&gt; &gt;&gt; points to a spe=\r\ncification and the specification explains how to process\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the data acco=\r\nrding to its intent.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Can that *be* any more clear? Is there some=\r\n alternate registry for the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Web that I&#39;m not aware of? If your media t=\r\nype isn&#39;t registered, and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you&#39;re sending it over the Web, you&#39;re not e=\r\nven _attempting_ to be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; RESTful.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; To the &quot;sufficient&quot; q=\r\nuestion: if I have a document that I return as\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; XML (application/xml),=\r\n what really matters to the consumer of that\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; document - can I associa=\r\nte a schema with the document?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; That doesn&#39;t make your messa=\r\nging self-descriptive, because you&#39;re\n&gt; &gt;&gt; requiring introspection to deter=\r\nmine the nature of the document. I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; need to know the nature of the data=\r\n by looking at the headers, not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (perhaps) unzipping your content and s=\r\nniffing it first -- application/\n&gt; &gt;&gt; xml is *not* self-descriptive, as has=\r\n been (correctly) pointed out on\n&gt; &gt;&gt; this list a hundred times...\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; If it isn&#39;t, even though the media type in use is well-defined and=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; registered with IANA, absent some form of schema (DTD, XML Schema,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt; RelaxNG), the client I wrote really cannot assume that the meanings\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; are the same.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; No, self-descriptiveness does not require=\r\n introspection of the content\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to determine its processing model, it&#39;s =\r\ndependent on registered media\n&gt; &gt;&gt; type identifiers. If I send XHTML as tex=\r\nt/plain, you need to treat it\n&gt; &gt;&gt; as text/plain, not introspect it and det=\r\nermine that its schema means it\n&gt; &gt;&gt; should be treated as XHTML -- that&#39;s s=\r\nniffing, and sniffing has nothing\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to do with REST.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; As=\r\n to the necessary question: Was the &quot;Atom&quot; specification any less\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; val=\r\nid and self-describing the day before it was registered with IANA\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; tha=\r\nn it was the day after? It was self-describing before and after.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; No, it was not. Identifiers that aren&#39;t listed in *any* registry can&#39;=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt;&gt; *possibly* meet Roy&#39;s definition of self-descriptiveness:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&quot;Self-descriptive means that the type is registered and the registry\n&gt; &gt;&gt; p=\r\noints to a specification and the specification explains how to process\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n the data according to its intent.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Before Atom&#39;s identifier was =\r\nregistered in IANA, it was registered...\n&gt; &gt;&gt; where? If the identifier isn&#39;=\r\nt in a registry, then it can&#39;t point to a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; specification, so it can&#39;t *=\r\npossibly* meet Roy&#39;s definition.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; The internet has few bake=\r\nd in central control points - DNS might be\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the only one, really - eve=\r\nn with respect to REST, we have a\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; combination of standards organizati=\r\nons including the IETF, W3C, IANA,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and OASIS that all contribute &quot;sta=\r\nndards&quot; to help the web form.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; None of which aren&#39;t recogniz=\r\ned by the IANA registry, which is a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; registry, not a standards body. Me=\r\nrely a means to point identifiers to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; descriptive documents, published =\r\nby *any* entity that claims to be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; releasing a &quot;standard&quot; by the entity=\r\n&#39;s own (and not IANA&#39;s) definition.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Could the bar *be* any lower?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; If China, with its hundreds of millions of internet users, dec=\r\nides\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; that it can&#39;t be bothered to register a media type with IANA, ye=\r\nt it\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; could easily be that *every* relevant Chinese client of that\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; media-type might readily understand it. That sounds like a feature\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n of the internet, not a bug.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I have no problem with that. H=\r\nowever, in _reality_ there is no\n&gt; &gt;&gt; alternate registry to IANA, not here,=\r\n not in China, not anywhere on the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; planet. So discussions about theore=\r\ntical alternatives to IANA are just\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that -- theoretical. On the Web, t=\r\noday, there exists only the IANA\n&gt; &gt;&gt; registry, therefore there is no other=\r\n means to meet Roy&#39;s requirement:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Self-descriptive means that th=\r\ne type is registered and the registry\n&gt; &gt;&gt; points to a specification and th=\r\ne specification explains how to process\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the data according to its inte=\r\nnt.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sure, if the Chinese alternative to IANA comes along, it wou=\r\nld be a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; legitimate registry for meeting the self-descriptiveness const=\r\nraint.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; But, here&#39;s a list of *actual* registries which *exist* today o=\r\nn the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Web:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; IANA\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sure, alternatives are possible, b=\r\nut pragmatically, that&#39;s _all_ there\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is. Even if there were some other=\r\n registry, the wording of RFC 2616\n&gt; &gt;&gt; would still &quot;discourage&quot; its use.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I also like to think that REST make sense to think about in=\r\n the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; context of enterprise software. So to me, the question is,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n &quot;self-describing, but for what scope?&quot; Maybe this is a small scope,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nsuch as the software my company writes, and all of our customers.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Yet=\r\n, my company can then get the benefits of following a RESTful\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; archite=\r\ncture.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If you&#39;re sending HTTP over the Internet, then poten=\r\ntial participants\n&gt; &gt;&gt; in the communication include folks beyond your or yo=\r\nur partners&#39;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; organizational boundary. If your identifier is opaque, th=\r\nen these\n&gt; &gt;&gt; intermediaries can&#39;t be participants, but merely dumb routers=\r\n, which is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the result we&#39;re presumably trying to avoid by using REST i=\r\nn the first\n&gt; &gt;&gt; place.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, can anyone come back with a =\r\nsolid, convincing argument that\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this is not the case?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt; Hopefully, the above did that.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Not even close. You&#39;ve =\r\nfailed to do anything but speculate that maybe\n&gt; &gt;&gt; some alternative regist=\r\nry will emerge. A valid point, but moot, since\n&gt; &gt;&gt; no such alternative _ha=\r\ns_ emerged. Therefore, in order to meet Roy&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;&gt; requirement for self-des=\r\ncriptiveness:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Self-descriptive means that the type is registered=\r\n and the registry\n&gt; &gt;&gt; points to a specification and the specification expl=\r\nains how to process\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the data according to its intent.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; There=\r\n exist, on the Web, exactly ZERO legitimate alternatives to the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; IANA r=\r\negistry, in practice. Where else are media type identifiers\n&gt; &gt;&gt; registered=\r\n for anyone to look up their associated standards? Nowhere,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; severely r=\r\nestricting the options for meeting the constraint, in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; practice.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; To that end, I see REST as an aspirational endpoint.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I say that myself, all the time. However:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not goi=\r\nng to deny fellow architects the label of &quot;REST&quot; if, for\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; example, the=\r\ny got everything right, but used a few non-standard-IANA-\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; registered =\r\nmedia-types for a few small portions of their application.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nIf there&#39;s no intent to standardize a type or register an identifier,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nthen there&#39;s no effort being made at self-descriptiveness. This isn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\njust a mismatch, this is actively thwarting the goals of REST. Using\n&gt; &gt;&gt; a=\r\nn unregistered identifier for an unstandardized type is only congruous\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n with REST if there is an intent to change that situation -- what I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\narguing against here is the refusal to admit there&#39;s even a problem.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Some pages have links to other pages, and some pages might be\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; endpoints (with merely incidental links, like &quot;back&quot;). I suggest\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nthat in a RESTful world, the pages that link to other pages should\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; st=\r\nrongly favor standardized (and registered) media types. When you\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; get =\r\nto the &quot;endpoint&quot; pages that don&#39;t contribute to the hypertext\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; state =\r\nof an application (PDF, Flash, video), then the media type is\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; much mo=\r\nre wide open, and it should be.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; No, REST says nothing about=\r\n self-descriptiveness being optional, or\n&gt; &gt;&gt; more important / less importa=\r\nnt based on resource type. Self-\n&gt; &gt;&gt; descriptive messaging is a constraint=\r\n, and those who choose to ignore\n&gt; &gt;&gt; this _fact_ simply are not following =\r\nthe REST style, and should not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; call their results REST. I am opposed t=\r\no attaching the REST label\n&gt; &gt;&gt; where no effort is being made to follow the=\r\n style.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Of course, any good developer should reuse what is=\r\n already available,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and appropriate. On the other hand, given a hamme=\r\nr, don&#39;t turn\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; everything into a nail. Figuring out when to make a new=\r\n media type,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and when to reuse an existing one might actually be an e=\r\nxtremely\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; difficult call.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 100% agreed. My argument is =\r\nagainst the cavalier usage of unregistered,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; unstandardized types witho=\r\nut any mention whatsoever, and outright\n&gt; &gt;&gt; denial of the existence, of an=\r\ny constraint issues or tradeoffs\n&gt; &gt;&gt; associated with the practice. The bar=\r\n to registering an identifier is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; purposefully low, yet folks act like =\r\nit&#39;s an insurmountable obstacle,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; then pretend it isn&#39;t required.

REST&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt;&gt; has a self-descriptive *messaging* constraint.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt;&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; IANA registration is neither necessary, nor su=\r\nfficient to be&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; self-describing.  And if by &quot;standardi=\r\nzed&quot;, you mean IANA&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; registration, that&#39;s a very n=\r\narrow view of standards, given that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; there are many standar=\r\nds organizations in the world.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n IANA is not a standards body, it&#39;s a registry, which recognizes&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt;&gt; standards published by any entity that claims to be a standards body=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On the Web, IANA registration is absolutely a requirement --=\r\n how can&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; you square your claim that it isn&#39;t with Roy&#39;=\r\ns clear definition of the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; term?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &qu=\r\not;Self-descriptive means that the type is registered and the registry&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; points to a specification and the specification explains how to pr=\r\nocess&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; the data according to its intent.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Can that *be* any more clear?  Is there some alternate registry =\r\nfor the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Web that I&#39;m not aware of?  If your media type isn=\r\n&#39;t registered, and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; you&#39;re sending it over the Web, you=\r\n&#39;re not even _attempting_ to be&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; RESTful.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; To the &quot;sufficient&quot; question: if =\r\nI have a document that I return as&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; XML (application/xml), =\r\nwhat really matters to the consumer of that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; document - can=\r\n I associate a schema with the document?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; That doesn&#39;t make your messaging self-descriptive, because y=\r\nou&#39;re&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; requiring introspection to determine the nature of t=\r\nhe document.  I&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; need to know the nature of the data by looking=\r\n at the headers, not&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (perhaps) unzipping your content and snif=\r\nfing it first -- application/&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; xml is *not* self-descriptive, a=\r\ns has been (correctly) pointed out on&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; this list a hundred time=\r\ns...&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; If it isn&#39;t, even=\r\n though the media type in use is well-defined and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; register=\r\ned with IANA, absent some form of schema (DTD, XML Schema,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n RelaxNG), the client I wrote really cannot assume that the meanings&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt;&gt;&gt; are the same.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; No, s=\r\nelf-descriptiveness does not require introspection of the content&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&=\r\ngt; to determine its processing model, it&#39;s dependent on registered med=\r\nia&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; type identifiers.  If I send XHTML as text/plain, you need =\r\nto treat it&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; as text/plain, not introspect it and determine tha=\r\nt its schema means it&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; should be treated as XHTML -- that&#39;s=\r\n sniffing, and sniffing has nothing&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; to do with REST.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; As to the necessary question:  Was =\r\nthe &quot;Atom&quot; specification any less&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; valid and self=\r\n-describing the day before it was registered with IANA&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; tha=\r\nn it was the day after?  It was self-describing before and after.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&=\r\ngt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; No, it was not.  Identifiers that aren&=\r\n#39;t listed in *any* registry can&#39;t&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *possibly* meet Roy&#=\r\n39;s definition of self-descriptiveness:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;S=\r\nelf-descriptive means that the type is registered and the registry&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; points to a specification and the specification explains how to proces=\r\ns&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; the data according to its intent.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt;&gt; Before Atom&#39;s identifier was registered in IANA, it was register=\r\ned...&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; where?  If the identifier isn&#39;t in a registry, then =\r\nit can&#39;t point to a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; specification, so it can&#39;t *possib=\r\nly* meet Roy&#39;s definition.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; The internet has few baked in central control points - DNS might be&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the only one, really - even with respect to REST, we have a&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; combination of standards organizations including the IETF,=\r\n W3C, IANA,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and OASIS that all contribute &quot;standards&=\r\nquot; to help the web form.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; No=\r\nne of which aren&#39;t recognized by the IANA registry, which is a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; registry, not a standards body.  Merely a means to point identifiers t=\r\no&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; descriptive documents, published by *any* entity that claims=\r\n to be&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; releasing a &quot;standard&quot; by the entity&#39;s ow=\r\nn (and not IANA&#39;s) definition.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Could the bar *be* any lowe=\r\nr?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; If China, with its hund=\r\nreds of millions of internet users, decides&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; that it can&#3=\r\n9;t be bothered to register a media type with IANA, yet it&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n could easily be that *every* relevant Chinese client of that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&=\r\ngt; media-type might readily understand it.  That sounds like a feature&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of the internet, not a bug.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I have no problem with that.  However, in _reality_ there is no=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; alternate registry to IANA, not here, not in China, not anywh=\r\nere on the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; planet.  So discussions about theoretical alternati=\r\nves to IANA are just&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; that -- theoretical.  On the Web, today, =\r\nthere exists only the IANA&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; registry, therefore there is no oth=\r\ner means to meet Roy&#39;s requirement:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Se=\r\nlf-descriptive means that the type is registered and the registry&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&=\r\ngt; points to a specification and the specification explains how to process=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; the data according to its intent.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n;&gt; Sure, if the Chinese alternative to IANA comes along, it would be a&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt;&gt; legitimate registry for meeting the self-descriptiveness constr=\r\naint.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But, here&#39;s a list of *actual* registries which *exi=\r\nst* today on the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Web:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; IANA&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sure, alternatives are possible, but pragmatically, that=\r\n&#39;s _all_ there&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; is.  Even if there were some other registry=\r\n, the wording of RFC 2616&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; would still &quot;discourage&quot; i=\r\nts use.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I also like to thi=\r\nnk that REST make sense to think about in the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; context of e=\r\nnterprise software.  So to me, the question is,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;self=\r\n-describing, but for what scope?&quot;  Maybe this is a small scope,&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt;&gt;&gt; such as the software my company writes, and all of our customers=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Yet, my company can then get the benefits of following a=\r\n RESTful&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; architecture.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; If you&#39;re sending HTTP over the Internet, then potential part=\r\nicipants&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; in the communication include folks beyond your or you=\r\nr partners&#39;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; organizational boundary.  If your identifier i=\r\ns opaque, then these&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; intermediaries can&#39;t be participants,=\r\n but merely dumb routers, which is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; the result we&#39;re presum=\r\nably trying to avoid by using REST in the first&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; place.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, can anyone come back wit=\r\nh a solid, convincing argument that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this is not the ca=\r\nse?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Hopefully, the=\r\n above did that.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Not even clos=\r\ne.  You&#39;ve failed to do anything but speculate that maybe&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nsome alternative registry will emerge.  A valid point, but moot, since&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; no such alternative _has_ emerged.  Therefore, in order to meet Ro=\r\ny&#39;s&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; requirement for self-descriptiveness:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Self-descriptive means that the type is registered and the=\r\n registry&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; points to a specification and the specification expl=\r\nains how to process&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; the data according to its intent.&quot;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There exist, on the Web, exactly ZERO legitimate a=\r\nlternatives to the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; IANA registry, in practice.  Where else are=\r\n media type identifiers&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; registered for anyone to look up their=\r\n associated standards?  Nowhere,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; severely restricting the opti=\r\nons for meeting the constraint, in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; practice.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; To that end, I see REST as an aspirational =\r\nendpoint.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I say that myself, a=\r\nll the time.  However:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#=\r\n39;m not going to deny fellow architects the label of &quot;REST&quot; if, =\r\nfor&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; example, they got everything right, but used a few non=\r\n-standard-IANA-&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; registered media-types for a few small por=\r\ntions of their application.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If=\r\n there&#39;s no intent to standardize a type or register an identifier,&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; then there&#39;s no effort being made at self-descriptiveness.  T=\r\nhis isn&#39;t&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; just a mismatch, this is actively thwarting the =\r\ngoals of REST.  Using&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; an unregistered identifier for an unstan=\r\ndardized type is only congruous&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; with REST if there is an inten=\r\nt to change that situation -- what I&#39;m&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; arguing against her=\r\ne is the refusal to admit there&#39;s even a problem.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n;&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Some pages have links to other pages, and some =\r\npages might be&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; endpoints (with merely incidental links, li=\r\nke &quot;back&quot;).  I suggest&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; that in a RESTful world, =\r\nthe pages that link to other pages should&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; strongly favor s=\r\ntandardized (and registered) media types.  When you&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; get to=\r\n the &quot;endpoint&quot; pages that don&#39;t contribute to the hypertext&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; state of an application (PDF, Flash, video), then the medi=\r\na type is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; much more wide open, and it should be.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&=\r\ngt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; No, REST says nothing about self-descri=\r\nptiveness being optional, or&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; more important / less important b=\r\nased on resource type.  Self-&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; descriptive messaging is a const=\r\nraint, and those who choose to ignore&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; this _fact_ simply are n=\r\not following the REST style, and should not&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; call their results=\r\n REST.  I am opposed to attaching the REST label&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; where no effo=\r\nrt is being made to follow the style.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt;&gt;&gt; Of course, any good developer should reuse what is already avai=\r\nlable,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and appropriate.  On the other hand, given a hammer=\r\n, don&#39;t turn&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; everything into a nail.  Figuring out whe=\r\nn to make a new media type,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and when to reuse an existing =\r\none might actually be an extremely&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; difficult call.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n;&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 100% agreed.  My argument is against =\r\nthe cavalier usage of unregistered,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; unstandardized types witho=\r\nut any mention whatsoever, and outright&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; denial of the existenc=\r\ne, of any constraint issues or tradeoffs&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; associated with the p=\r\nractice.  The bar to registering an identifier is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; purposefully=\r\n low, yet folks act like it&#39;s an insurmountable obstacle,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nthen pretend it isn&#39;t required.  NOT REST!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; -=\r\nEric&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; -----------------------------=\r\n-------&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
