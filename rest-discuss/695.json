That&#39;s what happens when you PUT.  But luckily this is\nalready accounted for in HTTP, since the Content-Location header\nprovides a means to identify representations as resources.\n\n&gt;  And the concepts are very different:\n&gt; resources are / can be state machines that generate a\n&gt; time-varying stream of representations (or at least they are a\n&gt; time-varying stream of representations, i.e. for static content\n&gt; that evolves over time) while representations are themselves\n&gt; immutable and potentially mobile data.  The net effect is that it\n&gt; is difficult to name, sort out, and reason about the semantics of\n&gt; representations vs. resources.\n\nThey are each just things with identity.  That&#39;s how I think about it.\nI haven&#39;t had any trouble with that.\n\n&gt; POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. operate directly on *resources* named by\n&gt; URI.  When I perform one of these operations, it interacts\n&gt; directly with the resource in question and yields an appropriate\n&gt; response / representation of the resource.\n&gt; \n&gt; GET, however, is more ambiguous.  In general, it operates on\n&gt; *representations* of a named resource.  This may or may not imply\n&gt; an interaction with said resource.  In general, GET\n&gt; http://foo.com/bar means &quot;get the first valid representation of\n&gt; the resource at foo.com/bar that&#39;s lurking in the proxy chain\n&gt; from here to the origin server for that resource.&quot;  I.e., GET is\n&gt; really an operation that&#39;s conceptually about retrieving\n&gt; representations rather than interacting with the resource in\n&gt; question.\n\nGET is special because it doesn&#39;t change state and therefore can have\nits function distributed about the network.  Think of it this way; the\n&quot;main resource&quot; extends its tentacles to all caches on the Web, but\ncontrols them in a sense by how it specifies cache behaviour.  If it\nknows it&#39;s going to change frequently, it will use short Expires times\nto tell the caches that they have to phone home more often.  But this\npolicy is most definitely an attribute of the resource, not of a\nrepresentation.\n\nAnother way to think about this, is that there&#39;s a difference between\n&quot;the resource&quot; (say, me), my representations (picture, HTML page,\nvCard), and the software that manages all of that.  AFAIK, there&#39;s no\nname for the software.  But I think you may be confusing the resource\nwith that software, by your suggestion that GET doesn&#39;t operate on\nthe resource.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, Chief Science Officer, Planetfred, Inc.\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.      mbaker@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca   http://www.planetfred.com\n\n"}}
