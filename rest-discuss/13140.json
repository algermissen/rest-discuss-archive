I can&#39;t agree that these are the same states from an application\n&gt; perspective because they are clearly distinguished by control data in\n&gt; the HTTP message (Accept/Content-Type in this specific case).\n\nI&#39;m going back to what I stated before. If you care about identifying\nseparate things, then they should be separate things. Conneged\nrepresentations are *not* separate things because they share the same\nidentifier.\n\nThe application state is dependent on you navigating between things, not\nbetween representation of those things. If the representations have a\nmeaningful distinction for the continuation of the state transitions, they\nshould have identifiers. The identifiers we have are URIs to resources. If\nrepresentations matter, then they should have their own identifiers, as such\nbe promoted to resources themselves.\n\nLet&#39;s put it another way. If your application state depends not only on the\nexisting identifier, but also in control state data, you have indeed created\na new identifier, aka (URI+Method+Accept headers). I fail to see what this\nbrings you, as opposed to simply identify representations as separate\nthings?\n\nClient-driven conneg can only work for resource representations that do not\ndiffer enough to be meaningful to either the UA or the application state,\nhence why there is no provision for the extra data required to identify\nthose.\n\nYou say it yourself in the next paragraph:\n\n&gt; &gt;     If a bookmark is not a stored reference to a given application\n&gt; &gt;     state, what is it?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In this context it is a stored reference to an application state + a\n&gt; &gt; preferred format.\n&gt; \n&gt; The array of representations for a given resource are not application\n&gt; states in their own right?\n&gt; \n&gt; How would you model negotiating these formats in a state machine,\n&gt; without treating them as separate states?\n\nIf they have any meaningful distinction, then you represent them as\nseparately identified resources. If they do not have meaningful distinction,\nthen you don&#39;t.\n\nThe required data for a state transition to occur is the current state of\nthe application. In the case of a bookmark for a new client, there is no\napplication state on the client.\n\nI&#39;ll also reply to your various questions from Thursday:\n\n&gt; I understand that a representation can be &#39;made a resource&#39;, although\n&gt; the phrase &#39;treated as if it were&#39; would be more appropriate.\n\nI&#39;m afraid we may just not be using the same terminology. I use the word\n&#39;identifier&#39; with the meaning of &#39;identifying a resource&#39;, and &#39;resource&#39; as\n&#39;the smallest unit i can deal with when doing state transitions in ReST&#39; and\nas &#39;the thing / conceptual mapping / awww:resource identified by an\nidentifier&#39;. As such, I object strongly to the idea that there would be such\na thing as &#39;treating a thing as a resource&#39;. If it&#39;s important enough for me\nto interact with, and if it&#39;s identified, it&#39;s a resource.\n\n&gt; It&#39;s slightly confusing when you state that an identifier to a resource\n&gt; is &#39;enough&#39;, and then immediately contradict this position by\n&gt; entertaining &#39;the case that you want to identify a specific\n&gt; representation&#39;.\n\nI apologize for introducing confusion. Let me attempt to reformulate better.\n\nIf you want to interact with a thing, it has to be a resource. If you want\nto interact with two things distinctively, they are then fundamentally, by\nthe ReST and HTTP requirement of resources having an identifier, two\ndistinct resources. If however you interact with a single resource, that has\nmultiple representations that you do not need to address specifically, then\nyou may use conneg and have only one thing.\n\nTo take a specific example, if the plain text representation of this email\nis available at localhost/2234, and I wanted to interact with the plain/text\nmedia type with that resource, I could do so by using it&#39;s identifier. I\ncould also endup using conneg so that I could receive the text in both UTF-8\nand UTF-16 variations. If, on the other hand, I was maintaining a French and\nan English version of that message, I would find it useful to update the\nFrench version without impacting the English version. While they may carry\nthe same meaning, the French and English versions are hardly the &quot;same&quot;\nthing, as the difference between the two languages will always trigger some\nslight variations in the meaning of the text.\n\nThose two language variations may well be &quot;the response Sebastien is giving\nto Mike&quot;, but the two messages are two distinct texts, that are distinct\nthings: &quot;the French response&quot; and &quot;the English response&quot;. And that&#39;s why\nthey&#39;d have two distinct identifiers and be two distinct resources.\n\n\n&gt; So it&#39;s hard, from that, to make sense of whether or not treating a\n&gt; representation as a resource &#39;ought to be enough&#39;. This is particularly\n&gt; apparent given, as I mentioned before, the only significant benefit\n&gt; from\n&gt; doing this is that you get *plain text* hyperlinks to your\n&gt; representations - the value of this is questionable if an identifier to\n&gt; a resource is &#39;enough&#39; in the first place.\n\nSo you suggest that identifying a resource and dereferencing identifiers by\nfollowing hyperlink controls is not enough to navigate application state?\n\nYou&#39;re either proposing a new identifier that includes http control data, or\nyou&#39;re not happy with how the web currently works. Either way, I&#39;m not so\nsure what you&#39;re suggesting is actually buying, to http, to ReST, or to the\nweb.\n\n&gt; &gt; The state transition is the result of dereferencing such identifier,\n&gt; and is\n&gt; &gt; dependent on the state of the application. As such, it is of course\n&gt; &gt; dependent on the current state the client has, if any, and the\n&gt; current state\n&gt; &gt; the server holds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; If it is possible for a hyperlink to include control data, then a\n&gt; hypermedia driven state transition is more than simply dereferencing an\n&gt; href URI.\n\nNo, hyperlink controls do not do that. Let&#39;s take an example of a well-known\ncontrol. &lt;form action=&quot;/&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot; enctype=&quot;multipart/form-data&quot; /&gt;\n\nThe URI in action is the identifier to the resource for which an operation\nwill execute. Everything else is a hint to the user-agent to let it\nunderstand the representation format it can send, and the http method being\nexpected from it.\n\nWhat this means is that the target resource is identified by its URI. The\nstate transition is helped by hinting to the UA how to process the\ntransition, aka how to build the representation that will be used in the\ntransition.\n\nAt no point is there a new identifier for (/ with POST with mediatype\nmultipart). That would be a new identifier entirely, and one I see very\nlittle value in. At no point either is there any assertion that the target\nresource only support the multipart/form-data media type, or that you can\nonly operate on it with the POST method.\n\nThat&#39;s why this data is part of a hypermedia link, and why this hypermedia\nlink contains both the identifier and the mean to interact with it.\n\nNothing prevents me from achieving the same result by using OPTIONS to\ndiscover the methods and the media types (using the Link: header) and\nachieve the same state transition.\n\nThat&#39;s why I said they were at different levels in the stack. Resources are\nthings, representations are what you use to manipulate things, and\nhypermedia controls are the hints that help the UA discover resources and\nbuild the representations to manipulate those things.\n\nThe core of your argument has been around conneg, but I think you&#39;re wanting\nto see more in conneg than what it was designed for, and I still do not\nunderstand why it is such an issue to identify distinct things distinctly.\n\nMaybe if you could provide some scenarios that you cannot achieve through\nthe current understanding of what resources and representations are in the\ncontext of ReST we could have a better substrate for conversation.\n\nSeb\n\n\n"}}
