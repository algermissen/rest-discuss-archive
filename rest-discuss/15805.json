If I want to create a new customer instance, I could POST a re=\r\npresentation of that customer to the collection resource. The server return=\r\ns a &quot;201 created&quot; and the URI of the new customer instance, maybe &#39;/custome=\r\nrs/1234&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now let&#39;s say I need to update this particular customer enti=\r\nty with new information. I could PUT the new description to the instance UR=\r\nI or I could POST it. Since &#39;/customers/1234&#39; is not a collection resource =\r\nthere is no ambiguity about what I want: Update this particular customer in=\r\nstance.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there a problem with that approach?
