It&#39;s just that it is brittle and, as you say yourself, requires r=\r\ne-configuration of the front-end when the back-end changes. It simply anoys=\r\n me: no one have ever told me to reconfigure my browser in order to lookup =\r\nan ordernumber at Amazon, just because they changed their internal implemen=\r\ntation and URL structure.\n\n&gt; Please tell me you see how this is coupling, a=\r\nnd a bad thing.\n\nYes, the idea of passing the URL to the web-browser is als=\r\no brittle as you point out, probably even more brittle. I totally agree wit=\r\nh that.\n\nSo neither solutions are perfect. What can we do instead?\n\n&gt; The w=\r\niski.org\n&gt; /date service will eventually have an Xforms interface to descri=\r\nbe the\n&gt; API -- a URI template won&#39;t do, because the number of days in Febr=\r\nuary\n&gt; is algorithmic.  But, that doesn&#39;t mean a client of the API is requi=\r\nred\n&gt; to be an Xforms client, or otherwise consume that form.\n\nYes. Publish=\r\ning search forms in the back-end solves most of the problems. Now my back-e=\r\nnd has a way to instruct the front-end how to fetch the ATOM resource refer=\r\nenced externally by the simple string &quot;peter&quot;. \n\nCompare it to my previous =\r\nAmazon ordernumber example: you, as a web-user, would never type the direct=\r\n URL to Amazons order-information-page if all you had was an ordernumber. S=\r\no instead you open the Amazon &quot;search for orders&quot; form and insert your orde=\r\nrnumber. Amazon can then redirect you to whatever internal URL they want.\n\n=\r\nThe same can be done programmatically in the front-end if just the back-end=\r\n has a machine-readable search form. This adds my required flexibility at t=\r\nhe cost of a bit more code in the front-end.\n\n&gt; No REST constraint is being=\r\n broken by having charger proxy wiski.org,\n&gt; this is a common solution to c=\r\nommon problems of Web development.  Don&#39;t\n&gt; believe any argument that leads=\r\n you to conclude that setting up simple\n&gt; forwarding or proxying of URIs is=\r\n forbidden by REST.  That just isn&#39;t\n&gt; the case.\n\nAgreed. It does not break=\r\n any REST principles.\n\n\nSo what I am missing now is a standard format for p=\r\nublishing &quot;these are the ways you should access items using the REST API&quot; -=\r\n in a way that can be parsed at runtime.\n\nHere is one suggestion:\n\n1) The o=\r\nfficial &quot;here can you find the specs&quot; kind of REST &quot;sitemap&quot;.\n\nA simple mic=\r\nroformat. Look for anchors of class &quot;rest.search&quot;. Requires only a shared k=\r\nnowledge of the identifiers &quot;mysite-orders&quot; and &quot;mysite-customers&quot;.\n\n&lt;html&gt;=\r\n\n  &lt;body&gt;\n\t&lt;p&gt;... human readable help and introduction ...&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n\t  =\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://mysite.com/ordersearch.html&quot; class=3D&quot;rest.search&quot; id=\r\n=3D&quot;mysite-orders&quot;&gt;Orders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n\t  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;...&quot; class=3D&quot;rest.sea=\r\nrch&quot; id=3D&quot;mysite-customers&quot;&gt;Orders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n=\r\n2) The &quot;mysite.orders&quot; search specification at http://mysite.com/ordersearc=\r\nh.html\n\nRequires only shared knowledge of the fact that there will be an &lt;i=\r\nnput&gt; element with the ID &quot;ordernumber&quot;.\n\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;form id=3D&quot;m=\r\nysite-orders&quot; action=3D&quot;...&quot; method=3D&quot;...&quot; enctype=3D&quot;...&quot;&gt;\n\t  &lt;input id=\r\n=3D&quot;ordernumber&quot; name=3D&quot;amazon-internal-ordernumber&quot;/&gt;\n\t  &lt;input type=3D&quot;s=\r\nubmit&quot;\n\t&lt;/form&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n\nAll of this information could be auto-gen=\r\nerated from a platform like OpenRasta. It should also be easy to create a l=\r\nibrary that consumes these documents at runtime (and caches them, so we don=\r\n&#39; have to fetch the search spec eveytime).\n\n\n/J=F8rn\n\n\n\n"}}
