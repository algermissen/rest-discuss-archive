Is the comment coming from developers\n&gt; using POD or using ReST architectures?\n&gt; \n&gt; We&#39;ve had many discussions with people around ReST here, and it seems that\n&gt; on the one side, people have been saying they prefer ReST when talking about\n&gt; POD RPCish services. On the other side, the feedback has been that we&#39;ve not\n&gt; been communicating in a pragmatic enough fashion the differences /\n&gt; advantages of various architectures, including DDDD, EDA etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; What would you reckon is the proportion of people that want to get ReST, as\n&gt; opposed to flat RPC-style POD apis?\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;ve never heard of the terms POD, DDDD, or EDA, but I think I \nunderstand your question.  I still think the vast majority don&#39;t know \nthe difference between RPCish stuff and REST.  Many think REST is \n&quot;pretty&quot; URLs.  Its what I thought a few years ago when I first started \nlooking at REST and I find it is a common perception.\n\nThis is why I think the most important step is to get people to conform \nto the uniform interface.  Stress the importance of conforming to it. \n From my own experience, once you start designing interfaces that \nconform to the uniform interface it starts making you think more \nRESTfully.  It starts pushing you to make RESTful decisions even if you \ndon&#39;t know what REST truly is.\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
