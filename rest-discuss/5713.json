We understand this to be an \naddress to a resource (conceptually, the &quot;site&quot;).  We know that when we \nget back an HTML document for the GET request, we are returned a \nrepresentation of that resource, constrained to content-type being \nreturned.  Similarly, if we were to receive back a response of type \n&quot;text/robots&quot;, it is also just a representation of the same resource \nconfined to the returned content-type.  Similarly, getting back a P3P \ndocument or a favicon, based on content-type, is still returning a \nrepresentation of the same resource (the &quot;site&quot;).  I would not consider \nthem to be meta-data, just more facets of the same resource.\n\nAlso, this is generally applicable, not just to the &quot;site root&quot;.  For \ninstance, suppose we were to request &quot;http://sample.com/path/item&quot;.  If \na text/robots response were returned, it could indicate the indexability \nof that resource (and/or possibly &quot;child&quot; resources).  Or you could get \nback a favicon just for that resource, or P3P info, etc.\n\nIf we want to think of this more theoretically, we could assume that \nevery resource has a potentially infinite amount of information.  \nDefining content-types like text/html, text/robots, text/p3p, \nimage/favicon, and so on is just a way of coming to agreement on how to \nprovide the representations of a resource.  It doesn&#39;t necessarily mean \nthat the resource didn&#39;t have the information before a representational \ncontent-type was defined for it.  However, I think that many people \nstart at the content-type and end up at the resource (robots.txt, \nfavicon.ico, etc.) instead of starting with the resource (the &quot;site&quot;) \nand ending up with the representations in various content-types.  This \n&quot;backwardness&quot; causes people to perceive these things as metadata, \nsomething separate from the resource itself.\n\nSo I say Down With Special-Purpose URIs, Up With Content Negotiation!\n\nSeairth\n\nMark Nottingham wrote:\n&gt; One way to do this a little more cleanly is to use OPTIONS *. The  \n&gt; problem is that most (all?) servers don&#39;t have any easy (i.e., not  \n&gt; writing a module) way to influence the response to OPTIONS.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On 2006/03/16, at 3:36 AM, Nic wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; David Powell &lt;djpowell@...&gt; writes:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Wednesday, March 15, 2006, 8:42:56 PM, Nic wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think content neg could contribute to solving this; eg: for\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; robots.txt:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; GET / HTTP/1.1\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Host: someplace.com\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Accept: robot/robot\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think that would work for p3p and most other meta data  \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; requirements\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as well.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         \n&gt;&gt;&gt; I think that the argument against this is that the robots.txt file or\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p3p policy, and the home page of the site are really very different\n&gt;&gt;&gt; resources.  What if someone wants to do an XSLT transform on the P3P\n&gt;&gt;&gt; policy - shouldn&#39;t it have its own URL.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt;&gt; Sure... but content neg can handle that as well. The point is a\n&gt;&gt; request for meta data can be made using content neg:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  GET / HTTP/1.1\n&gt;&gt;  Host: someplace.com\n&gt;&gt;  Accept: robot/robot\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The reply *could* be:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  HTTP/1.1 302 Ok\n&gt;&gt;  Location: /place/I/keep/robots.txt\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Same for the P3P stuff. It&#39;s the metadata querying that content neg is\n&gt;&gt; good for.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As for the favicon,  I never understood why that wasn&#39;t an HTML LINK\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; type.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         \n&gt;&gt;&gt; It is also an HTML LINK, with /favicon.ico as a fallback. I imagine\n&gt;&gt;&gt; that they thought people wouldn&#39;t want to change every single page on\n&gt;&gt;&gt; their site.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt;&gt; Hmmm... that is a good point. But it&#39;s not done for CSS files (where\n&gt;&gt; it would be similarly useful) so I don&#39;t see that it&#39;s necessary for\n&gt;&gt; favicon personally.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Nic\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
