I&#39;ve been toying with the idea of detailing\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; any method semantics against either the element itself or a\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;rel&quot; attribute.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes, I think so, too. Since the client understands the semantics\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of the transition it is taking anyway[1] there is usually no need\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to specify the method in the hypertext.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To make sure I understand correctly, are you suggesting that\n&gt; &gt; ideally link relations would specify (in the link registry) which\n&gt; &gt; method should be used to navigate to the target URI?\n\nYou can always *navigate* there with GET. If any other method achieves\nsome &#39;opration&#39; then that must be specified as part of the relations\nsemantics. (which are the semantics of the target resource in the\ngiven context)\n\n\n\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes. With GET being the default. The relation type describes the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; semantics of the link target and these semantics include what\n&gt; &gt;&gt; kind of domain goals the client can achive with requests to the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; target resource.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If you see &lt;link rel=&quot;cart&quot; href=&quot;./shopping-cart&quot;/&gt; and the type\n&gt; &gt;&gt; spec for &#39;cart&#39; tells you that a DELETE request on it empties the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; cart then you know that\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; DELETE ./shopping-cart achieves the domain goal of emptying the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; cart.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I started to describe that in http://www.nordsc.com/blog/?p=8\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;http://www.nordsc.com/blog/?p=8&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (last paragraph where it says: &quot;express the operations that are\n&gt; &gt;&gt; currently stated in the form of prose in hypermedia\n&gt; &gt;&gt; specifications in terms of the above predicate conjunctions and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; HTTP operations&quot;)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So perhaps a &quot;create&quot; relation could be registered that specifies\n&gt; &gt; &quot;POST&quot; as the method to use?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; No, link relations denote resource semantics, not actions. The\n&gt; &gt; resource\n&gt; &gt;&gt; semantics include what is achived by what requests on the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; resource.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; I am confused, I thought you were saying that a link relation would\n&gt; define what actions/verbs could be applied to the resource.\n\nThe desription of the relation defines the meaning of the target  \nresource,\nIWO: the end of the &#39;foo&#39; link is a &#39;bar&#39; resource. You achieve this and\nthat by PUTing to such &#39;bar&#39; resources.\n\n&gt; Would it\n&gt; be better if there was a &quot;collection&quot; relation that said that you\n&gt; could GET and POST to it?\n\nyes, exactly. In this sense, there is no difference between\n\n&lt;link rel=&quot;collection&quot; href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;\n\nand\n\n&lt;collection href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;\n\nWhich is why I called it &quot;(named) hypermedia context&quot; in the blog  \n[sorry, but I\njust had no better word for it]\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If you say\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;link rel=&quot;lock&quot; href=&quot;/445/lock&quot;/&gt; these semantics might be that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; PUT creates the lock and DELETE removes it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Would this be problematic for custom relations that the client may\n&gt; &gt; not be aware of the appropriate method for?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The cient needs to implement the semantics anyway. However, if\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the HTTP connector implementation you use does not support all\n&gt; &gt;&gt; methods, dump it and get a better one.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am not sure I understand. If a user agent gives user a selection\n&gt; between different links/relations to follow, they should still be able\n&gt; to follow the link without understanding the link relation definition,\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t they?\n\nWith GET yes, for other methods, they&#39;d better understand the effect the\nrequest will have, eh?\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Currently, the Atom link registry does not specify any defined\n&gt; &gt; methods for any of the existing relations that are registered.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If there is no such definition, no domain operations are\n&gt; &gt;&gt; involved. GET makes sense by default.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Even the &quot;edit&quot; relation doesn&#39;t specify a method, it is still just\n&gt; &gt; GETable resource that one can apply the uniform interface to.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; No. The semantics of edit and edit-media are defined in the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; AtomPub specs and there the effect of a PUT and DELETE to either\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of them is specified.\n&gt;\n&gt; The effects described by AtomPub are just reiterating the already\n&gt; prescribed effects defined by the uniform interface of the HTTP\n&gt; protocol, aren&#39;t they?\n\nNo, they do (a bit) more. See media entry aspects.\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t see anything here [1] that suggests\n&gt; that a target of the &quot;edit&quot; resource deviates from normal uniform\n&gt; interface behavior.\n\nI guess that is because the target resources do not have semantics  \noutside\nthe HTTP domain. AtomPub sort of re-specifies parts of what is already  \ninherent\nin HTTP - and also overspecifies things that contradict HTTP. For  \nexample,\na server cannot be constrained (from HTTP POV) as to what to return for\na request on a certain resource. AtomPub does that and thus limits\nserver evolvability because it couples it to a client expectation\nthat is not part of HTTP.\n(E.g. the spec says that requests to collection resource return Atom  \nfeed documents)\n\nJan\n\n&gt;\n&gt; http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/rfc5023.html#edit-via-PUT\n&gt; - --\n&gt; Kris Zyp\n&gt; SitePen\n&gt; (503) 806-1841\n&gt; http://sitepen.com\n&gt; -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\n&gt; Version: GnuPG v1.4.9 (MingW32)\n&gt; Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org/\n&gt;\n&gt; iEYEARECAAYFAktgrIgACgkQ9VpNnHc4zAwFlgCfX8v+iUHBqv1cJUZpcosLUxut\n&gt; rV0An3522rURI4Hbw4YpNko4PUeeMWPp\n&gt; =Jg5B\n&gt; -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n-----------------------------------\n  Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n\n  Mail: algermissen@...\n  Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n  Work: http://www.nordsc.com/\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n"}}
