In the case of jakarta struts, I don&#39;t know\n&gt; that the position is entirely indefensible. Would the developers get more\n&gt; payoff from refactoring struts to adhere to REST design principles, or\n&gt; from, I dunno, adding some new whizbang feature? Probably the latter, at\n&gt; least from the point of view of their employers.\n&gt;\nAnother thing to consider in the case of Struts is that it is meant more for\nweb-based user interface purposes than pure information access purposes. The\nexisting technology and needs of user interface apps make it hard to apply\nREST principles or gain the benefits that a pure information based app\ntypically gets.\nSo, I think there are some things Struts could do to make apps built with it\nmore capable, but I wouldn&#39;t push it too far since I believe the needs and\ngoals are different.\n\n"}}
