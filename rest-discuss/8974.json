Also, just because the toolmakers of the WS stack don&#39;t buy into\nWebArch, doesn&#39;t mean that their customers wouldn&#39;t like some of it\n... There are people out there with a more wholistic view, and we should try\nto help them&quot;\n\nSir Tim Berners-Lee&#39;s response immediately after\n&quot;TBL: We owe the world a statement about the loss of network effects from\nhaving a parallel web\n... People have the right to define independent information spaces, we can&#39;t\nstop them\n... We have some ideas about possible routes towards convergence, but the\nTAG can&#39;t make that happen\n... It&#39;s not a topic on which the TAG itself should spend much effort&quot;\n\nAnd so the TAG has effectively stopped looking at the REST vs WS-* separate\narchitectures.  One obvious follow on interpretation is that because the TAG\nhas said little agin WS-Transfer, the W3C may have nothing against\nWS-Transfer, and other follow-on specs.\n\nAgain, I was hoping for something from the customer or other non-vendor\nsides to bring back to the TAG and others, but that didn&#39;t happen.  And I\nremain surprised by that.\n\nCheers,\nDave\n \n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Alan Dean [mailto:alan.dean@...] \n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, June 12, 2007 3:34 PM\n&gt; To: orchard@...\n&gt; Cc: Steve Loughran; Rest List\n&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] Web of Services for Enterprise Computing\n&gt; \n&gt; On 6/12/07, Dave Orchard &lt;orchard@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; There were a lot of users and &quot;.com&quot;s in the room.

Even \n&gt; &gt; when I have different tools in the toolbox, sometimes they can have \n&gt; &gt; things in common to make it easier to use the essential \n&gt; parts of each \n&gt; &gt; tool.  Like having a metric to imperial conversion or tools \n&gt; with both units.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave,\n&gt; \n&gt; Are there any resources / write-ups about the kind of tools \n&gt; that you have in mind? It sounds like my impressions of what \n&gt; you mean is incorrect and that may be because there is no \n&gt; context on the referenced blog entry and the Meeting report \n&gt; does not elaborate on that aspect.\n&gt; \n&gt; The reason why I mentioned MS, Sun and IBM is that it is hard \n&gt; to imagine a significant delta to the WS-* spec stack without \n&gt; their buy-in, even if they weren&#39;t in the room - but if your \n&gt; comments do not imply any specification changes to WS-*, it \n&gt; isn&#39;t important.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have to admit that I wonder what the WS &lt;-&gt; REST interop \n&gt; requirement is. No obvious use cases come to mind - although \n&gt; that could simply be that it&#39;s nearly midnight here and I&#39;m \n&gt; knackered ;-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Alan\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
