Via expensive proprietary software.  Hyperlinks \n&gt; could turn at least the links into infrastructure.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are similar dependencies and ripple effects of change in many \n&gt; other domains, e.g. software development.\n&gt; \n&gt; There should be a terrific REST story rippling through these links.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Bob Haugen\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
