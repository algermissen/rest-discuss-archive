In a class and\ninstance based system, you could create a subscription that was interested\nin a &#39;type&#39; of instance being created (&#39;tell me when a new purchase order is\ncreated&#39;). In a purely instance based system (like the web) you typically\nuse containers to represent that (&#39;tell me when a new resource is added to\n&#39;pending purchase orders&#39;). The resource &#39;pending purchase orders&#39; might\nonly support events and not enumeration.\nWhen a resource is deleted, the uri is still valid and usable - a saving\ngrace of the web - so that isn&#39;t a problem. I&#39;ve worked with db systems that\nused referential integrity and &#39;referencing&#39; delete entities was a &#39;bit&#39; of\na problem.\n\n2b) More &#39;operation&#39; stuff\nIf there is a concept of &#39;add&#39; or &#39;added&#39;, then there is concept of\ncollection - another fuzzy area of the Web. I commonly use a model that\nsupports collections in a nice way - resources have named properties,\nproperties can be an atomic value or a collection. These named properties\n(atomic or collection) are subscribable (which implies referenceable), but\nnot directly addressable (retrievable?). The operations of &#39;add/remove&#39;\nwould apply to these collection properties, and &#39;update&#39; would apply to the\natomic properties. Subscriptions on the resource imply a subscription on all\nsub-properties as well. I&#39;ve also allowed a subscription to indicate\nmultiple operations, but on the Web I&#39;d be okay with one per subscription\n(otherwise you get into managing a collection of criteria... but maybe a\nsubscription uri with a &quot;;criteria&quot; parameter would work...).\n\nFor example:\n\nWATCH http://www.topiczero.com:8000/kn/who/prescod.net/paul;presence\nHTTP/1.1\nReplyTo: http://nomad.dierken.com/followme/instantmsg.cgi\nAccept: text/xml\n\nWATCH http://www.topiczero.com:8000/kn/who/dierken.com/mike;buddies HTTP/1.1\nReplyTo: http://nomad.dierken.com/followme/instantmsg.cgi\nAccept: text/xml\n\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;S.

I&#39;d like to see one for detailing &#39;best practices&#39; for &quot;202\n&gt; Accepted&quot; - but I just don&#39;t have the time right now...\n&gt;\n&gt; All in all this is a really wonderful wrap up of where we are at today!\n&gt; Who is ready to start coding? If you are Java friendly, I&#39;d like to\nsuggest\n&gt; starting with http://www.sourceforge.com/projects/destiny - I know it\ntalks\n&gt; about JMS, but it&#39;s more important that it is an HTTP messaging server.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Some comments:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1 &quot;The response to the Subscription MAY include a Location...&quot;\n&gt; Do you mean: &quot;The response to [creating] the subscription...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; 2 &quot;Event: (CHANGED|EXTENDED|DELETED|ADDED|(or application defined)) &quot;\n&gt; I strongly think these should be based on create, read, update, delete\n&gt; [operations on atomic information] and add and remove [operations on\n&gt; collections]. There should be a map to what HTTP methods typically would\n&gt; generate (as you&#39;ve indicated in the document). I&#39;ve spent a lot of time\n&gt; thinking about this one and would like to continue discussions on this\n&gt; point.\n&gt; I also believe &#39;user defined&#39; is to be avoided in the same way that new\n&gt; methods in http are to be avoided.\n&gt; If it comes to a problem with flexibility describing the change to the\n&gt; resource - I highly recommend using &#39;sub-properties&#39; in the same sense as\n&gt; pointed out by MarkB relating to the &quot;;&quot; in urls. This &#39;sub-property&#39; is\n&gt; controlled by the resource, but not necessarily independently addressable.\n&gt; If it were addressable, then it would be subscribable, and those\n&gt; subscriptions would receive the event.\n&gt; For example, listening to a users online status might be:\n&gt; Target-URI: http://www.topiczero.com:8000/kn/who/dierken.com/mike/\n&gt; Property: presence\n&gt; Operation: update\n&gt;\n&gt; 3 &quot;some form of &quot;difference&quot; may suffice &quot;\n&gt; Content negotiation is goodness. Personally, I&#39;d avoid &#39;delta&#39; events, due\n&gt; to problems with often needing guaranteed delivery and sequence. Sending\n&gt; temperature as &quot;up:3&quot; isn&#39;t as good as &quot;98&quot;. But I understand that\nsometimes\n&gt; deltas are okay.\n&gt;\n&gt; 4 &quot;the Event Sink may email notifications &quot;\n&gt; You will probably want user-agent metadata on the subscription (what\n&gt; user-agent, what content-type, and what form of content-type (like\ndifferent\n&gt; approaches to html mail)). Something for the future, but make sure there\nis\n&gt; room later.\n&gt;\n&gt; 5 &quot;may define a convention for using query parameters...&quot;\n&gt; Yay! I realize this is a short-term hack for backward compatibility - but\n&gt; you gotta do what you gotta do...\n&gt;\n&gt; 6 &quot;HTTP-equiv could also be used &quot;\n&gt; Nifty.\n&gt;\n&gt; 7 &quot;browser would ask the user&quot;\n&gt; This would probably (d)evolve into HTML in the same way that HTTP\n&gt; authentication evolved into custom HTML forms for logging in. Don&#39;t\n&gt; underestimate the power of the marketing side.\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
