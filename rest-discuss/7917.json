If REST is done right, then we shouldn&#39;t need to\n&gt; coordinate\n&gt; &gt; the two design efforts. The interfaces between the two should be\n&gt; limited\n&gt; &gt; to HTTP.\n&gt; I agree. Moreover, I also think you generally have different design\n&gt; goals with client and server APIs. For example performance is\n&gt; normally a lot more important for servers than clients. Also, a\n&gt; simple API might be more desirable on the client than on the server\n&gt; (again, because of performance). For these reasons it will likely do\n&gt; more harm than good to try to use server abstractions in a client API\n&gt; or vice-versa.\n\nI am of the opinion that it can be useful to share the same abstraction,\nthough it has to be fairly finely tuned and you may still have some\ntweaks on one side or the other.\n\nI believe I am credited with helping inspire J�r�me&#39;s writing of the\nrestlet framework, and I have developed a similar framework in-house for\nthe company I work fork. It started out as mostly an interface class for\ninteracting with a remote server, however we now also use it as part of\nthe mechanism to accept client requests. I combine it with a simplified\nroutes-like mechanism to locate an appropriate resource object which can\nthen have calls made upon it. Most of our software acts both as client\nto something and server another. This is enterprise-scale REST rather\nthan Web-scale.\n\nI admit it isn&#39;t perfect, but the opportunities to chain in extra\nauthentication mechansims and other features have proven useful. It has\nalso been easy to write little proxies to translate from one protcol to\nanother, for example from HTTP to our internal protocols. In short, I\nthink having a uniform interface in code has been a valuable way to\nbring the architectural constraints we are looking for closer to the\ndeveloper.\n\nBenjamin\n\n\n"}}
