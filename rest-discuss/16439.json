Anyway, I was just stating what I think, not stating anyone else is s=\r\naying the contrary, at least in this list.\n\n2. I said: &quot;REST, as I understa=\r\nnd, is a style. You can build it with whatever you want&quot; and you said: &quot;No,=\r\n you can&#39;t build whatever you want with REST.&quot;. Kind of different things, r=\r\night? Same words, different order, different meaning.\n\n3. You said: &quot;Where =\r\nREST is impractical, the advice here always\ncomes down to, &quot;then don&#39;t use =\r\nit.&quot;&quot;. Agree completely. If you read all my posts, I had never said the con=\r\ntrary.\n\n4. Disagree with several other things. \na. REST is not only for reu=\r\nse. If I don&#39;t care reuse, I can still have a case for REST.\nb. REST is NOT=\r\n about all the nodes out there, is about my application.\nc. I may be wrong,=\r\n but registering is not the only way of achieving self-descriptive language=\r\n. Again, maybe Roy can tell me why, if it is, REST only solution is registr=\r\nation.\nd. Non using IANA violates self-description? That is what all this d=\r\niscussion is all about.\ne. I have never said a &quot;style&quot; means freely ignores=\r\n constrains. That is not the definition of style. Style means you can use o=\r\nther things, following the same principles. It means do not force to use IA=\r\nNA and WEB for REST.\nf. I&#39;m not confused at all. I do promote the use of th=\r\ne right architectural style for the problem at hand. Read my posts. I have =\r\nno problem if you tell me my system is not REST. That is what I mean here.\n=\r\n\nHope we are clear!\n\nWilliam Martinez.\n\n\n\n"}}
