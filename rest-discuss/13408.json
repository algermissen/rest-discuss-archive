This could\nroughly take one of two forms:\n1. A set of specifications based on a range of technologies that focus on\nREST constraint compliance, or\n2. A more HTTP-centric set of specifications working on providing features\nnot available on the Web and probably not consistent with REST constraints\nsuch as pub/sub, transactions, reliable POST, etc.\n\nMethinks a little from column A, and a little from column B. The two seconds\nI have read reading descriptions on your site suggest more (2) than (1).\n\nWhile this is a good thing to be paying standards attention to, the first\nthing you will want to start to do is break the stateless constraint of\nREST. This will take what is potentially a major frustration for Roy in\nripping off the name of his architectural style to use as the codeword for a\nspecific non-web architecture and turn it into something much worse where\nthe so-called REST architecture actually doesn&#39;t comply with REST style. I\nreally would suggest a name like HTTP-* or Web-* rather than REST-* might go\na long way towards heading off a significant amount of angst.\n\nThat&#39;s a naming problem, and not a technical problem. Personally I am\nlooking for a forum where I can do exactly the kinds of things you seem to\nbe looking at: Focus on enterprise use of HTTP, and fill in gaps that can be\nfilled in at small scales in ways that are sympathetic to HTTP but don&#39;t\ncomply with REST architecture or are for some other reason not immediately\napplicable to the Web.
