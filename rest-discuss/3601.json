Is anyone working on a\n&gt; ReST Oriented Programming Environments?\n&gt;\n\nYes, Waterken Inc. is.\n\nThe web-calculus that we discussed a while back isn&#39;t just about\nproviding a security model. The web-calculus is a model for\nbuilding a REST interface to an application. I&#39;ve built a number\nof mappings of the web-calculus to local application models. The\none I&#39;m pushing the most at this time is the Waterken RDB Webizer.\nSee:\n\nhttp://www.waterken.com/dev/SQL/\n\nThere&#39;s a high level overview and a full developer tutorial linked\nto from that page.\n\nI am a little late getting to this thread because I was away at\nthe DOCsec 2003 conference when the thread started. At the\nconference, I presented the web-calculus and the Waterken RDB\nWebizer. The response was very enthusiastic. A number of people\nfound the union of REST and capability-based security to be a very\ncompelling model. This is especially interesting since DOCsec is\nan OMG sponsored conference. Most of the attendees are still\ncommitted to CORBA technology and find REST a foreign concept.\n\nThe DOCsec 2003 conference home page is:\n\nhttp://www.omg.org/news/meetings/docsec2003/index.htm\n\nMy presentation slides are at:\n\nhttp://www.waterken.com/dev/Web/DOCsec2003/\n\nBuilding a REST programming environment for relational databases\nis a very interesting first case. Since SQL doesn&#39;t come with any\nprocedural programming baggage, it&#39;s possible to build a\nprogramming environment in which the entire application is built\nin the REST mindset. You can build the entire application by just\ndefining the resource web, never being forced to switch gears and\nwrite procedural code.\n\nIf anyone on the list would like to use the Waterken RDB Webizer\non a current project, I would be willing to provide a free license\nin exchange for a product testimonial.\n\nTyler\n\n"}}
