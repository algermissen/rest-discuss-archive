It doesn=92t\n&gt; seem so to me =\r\n=96 So, why not use the query string?\nAristotle,\n\nYour right, it is not rea=\r\nlly an independent resource, but addressing  \ndependent resources is a comm=\r\non case, such as where\n\n\tGET /foo/person   returns XML for all information =\r\nabout a person and\n\tGET /foo/person/firstName returns just the person&#39;s fir=\r\nst name.\n\nIf &quot;size&quot; is a subordinate of the map, it should, I think,  be  \n=\r\naddressed with a path.\n\nSteve Bjorg says:\n\n&gt; In our REST framework for .Net=\r\n, we opted to use &#39;@&#39; as prefix for  \n&gt; built-in paths.  So, you would get:=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; GET /foo/map/@count\n\nHere the count is a path element, but how do you =\r\ndistinguish it from  \nthe key &quot;@count&quot;?\n\nURI encoding or some other escapin=\r\ng would certainly work, but that  \nis  a source of bugs when a caller forge=\r\nts to escape the &quot;@&quot;.  And,  \nit gives escaping or not escaping a semantic =\r\ncharacter, which feels  \nwrong to me.\n\nThe alternative, disallowing &quot;@&quot; as =\r\nthe first character in a key  \nwould be a fine solution for specific implem=\r\nentations, but I&#39;d like  \nto keep this model general, so restricting the se=\r\nt of valid  \ncharacters in a key is unpalatable.\n\nAlan Dean says:\n\n&gt; You co=\r\nuld drive it with content-negotiation:\n&gt;\n&gt; GET /foo/map\n&gt; Accept: applicati=\r\non/x-map-size\n\nAs with the query string solution, I much prefer that the si=\r\nze appear  \nas part of the URL. This use does not seem consistent with the =\r\nintent  \nof the Accept: header.\n\nAlan Dean also says:\n\n&gt; This won&#39;t work fo=\r\nr a browser UAs, so an alternative is:\n&gt;\n&gt; GET /foo/map.size\n\nThis is the s=\r\nolution that I&#39;d prefer, although perhaps with a  \ndifferent character: &quot;ma=\r\np$size&quot; or &quot;map!size&quot;. The delimiter  \ncharacter is very unusual inside pat=\r\nh elements in the REST and  \nRESTish interfaces I&#39;ve studied.  In this case=\r\n, the size is not  \nreally a path, but it does appear in the URI and the UR=\r\nI does address  \na resource that is logically connected to the map.\n\n\neric.=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
