I would put it differently.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; A language is mathematically defined as something like the following:\n&gt;&gt; a syntax + a semantics [1].\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;  A language is a grammar.  If by semantics, you mean the rules for  \n&gt; constructing valid sentences in the language (i.e. tree grammar,  \n&gt; regular grammar, etc.) then I agree, but if by semantics you mean  \n&gt; &quot;meaning,&quot; then we&#39;re heading into deep waters.  Languages don&#39;t  \n&gt; have meanings.  Constructs in a language MAY have a meaning.  So,  \n&gt; these two sets (all linguistically correct sentences and all  \n&gt; meaningful sentences)  have all different size and shouldn&#39;t be mixed.\n\nNo by semantics I do not meant the rules for constructing valid  \nsentences, and nor do most people. Constructing valid sentences  is  \nthe domain of syntax. Just read any book on mathematical logic.  \nSyntax deals with how you combine strings to form valid sentences.  \n From &quot;Introduction to Elementary Mathematical Logic&quot; by Abram  \nAronovich Stolyar (which I found on Google Books)\n\n[[\nSyntax studies the elements of the structure of a formalised language  \nwithout regard to what it expresses. Semantics studies the elements  \nand structure of a formalised language in connection with its  \nmeaningful interpretation (in connection with what it expresses in  \nextralinguistic reality).\n]]\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt; XML is original with respect to other language such as Java, JSON,\n&gt;&gt; etc, in that\n&gt;&gt; - it defines a syntax, without defining the semantics,\n&gt; This is wrong, regardless of the meaning of semantics used  \n&gt; previously.  Clearly XML has a grammar (referring to the first  \n&gt; meaning of &quot;semantics&quot;; the second meaning doesn&#39;t even apply).\n\nYou need to go back and look at what people mean by semantics.\n\n&gt;&gt; - it uses URIs as name space identifiers [2]\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; RDF/XML gives a semantics to subset of XML documents. The linking of\n&gt;&gt; RDF and XML is attractive, because RDF is a semantics without a\n&gt;&gt; syntax, and XML is a syntax without semantics, and both use URI\n&gt;&gt; identifiers. Whether RDF/XML is the best way to do this mapping or\n&gt;&gt; not is a good question. It works close to XML writers intuitions, but\n&gt;&gt; perhaps it is not close enough. There are other proposals on the\n&gt;&gt; table such as TRiX that make the syntax reflect more closely the\n&gt;&gt; semantics.\n&gt; I haven&#39;t checked out TRiX.\n&gt;\n&gt; BTW, does RDF support hypergraphs (i.e. edges that connect many  \n&gt; nodes)?  Mapping hypergraphs to graphs is a bit tedious.\n\nI have not played with hypergraphs, so I can&#39;t tell from experience,  \nthough theory says it is possible. But going from what wikipedia says  \nabout them, namely that &quot;While graph edges are pairs of nodes,  \nhyperedges are arbitrary sets of nodes, and can therefore contain an  \narbitrary number of nodes.&quot;\n\nThat&#39;s ok. You can have names for sets. Say you call the set of cats  \nand dogs &lt;http://eg.com/cd&gt; .\n\nYou can say\n\n:myCat a &lt;http://eg.com/cd&gt; .\n\nso the instanceof relation (abbreviated to a above) is a relation  \nthat relates things to arbitrary graphs.\n\nHenry\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Henry\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; PS.
