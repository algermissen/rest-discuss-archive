Jakob Nielsen talks about this topic here:\n&gt; :\n&gt; : http://www.useit.com/alertbox/990321.html\n&gt;\n&gt; Webarch [1] is pretty clear on the topic, though.  Agents should\n&gt; not infer properties from the URI, and &quot;agents&quot; means both people\n&gt; and machines.\n&gt;\nHmm. You&#39;re right that that document defines agents as both software  \nand people, but I suspect most web users haven&#39;t read that document  \nand may not know to not infer anything from URIs. My belief is that  \npeople do use the URI for clues as to information architecture, and  \ntherefore I think it is appropriate to design URIs with that in mind.\n\n&gt; [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#uri-opacity\n&gt;\n&gt; :\n&gt; : In observing my own behavior while using other people&#39;s web sites, I\n&gt; : noticed I occasionally find myself hacking off pieces of a URI in  \n&gt; the\n&gt; : hopes of finding something conceptually higher up in the hierarchy.\n&gt; : It usually didn&#39;t work, but I tried.

Why not improve the\n&gt; representations (i.e., linking) instead?\n&gt;\nMike can do that too, but all those things need to be at some URI  \neach, so why not select a canonical URI for each resource that may  \nhelp users figure out where they are in his information architecture.  \nUsers aren&#39;t depending on a URI meaning what they guess it means.  \nThey just try it and see if the representation matched their  \nexpectations. If it doesn&#39;t, they will quickly try something else. It  \nis the representation that they ultimately depend on.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nPresident\nArtima, Inc.\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n\n\n"}}
