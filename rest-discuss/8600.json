In the case of content-coding (which in practice often \nproves problematic in a few other ways) then the e-tag for the gzipped \nversion, the deflated version and the uncompressed version must not be \nthe same as each other (or for that matter, the same as for any other \nversion including historical version no longer available with the caveat \nthat if they are semantically the same as a historical version - to the \npoint that that historical version could be safely used in its place - \nthen they could share a weak but not a strong e-tag).\n\nIn the case of transfer-encoding this happens at a different conceptual \nlayer to the e-tag, and so they can be shared.\n\n\n"}}
