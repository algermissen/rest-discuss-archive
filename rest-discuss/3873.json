Its tragic flaw is that \n&gt; it did not standardize enough of the *semantics* of this interface to \n&gt; achieve the value it promised.\n\nIf it was any more specific, then the semantics wouldn&#39;t be uniform,\nand the ability for HTTP to be used with all resources would be\njeopardized; the &quot;universal information space&quot; that is the Web, wouldn&#39;t\nbe universal.\n\nIt&#39;s fine for HTTP&#39;s interface to be used in a manner which is more\nspecific than HTTP defines, if the two parties agree.  But when Roy\ntalks about the difficulty of extension, what I think he means is that\non the wilds of the Web, private agreements like that are problematic\nbecause they&#39;re not visible and require out-of-band agreement.  To be\nRESTful requires ensuring messages are self-descriptive and therefore\ndeclare any &quot;extended intentions&quot; (but unfortunately, HTTP 1.1 doesn&#39;t\nsupport doing that).\n\nMark.\n-- \nMark Baker.
