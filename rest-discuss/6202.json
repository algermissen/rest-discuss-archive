I was just having a conversation with my\n&gt; coworker (we run a big e-commerce site) about how torn we are about\n&gt; having to use cookies. It seems like a necessity. We used to do\n&gt; sessioning in the url but users would copy and paste their url to  \n&gt; their\n&gt; friends. Now their friends would jump into their session and  \n&gt; potentially\n&gt; be able to buy things on their credit card (yeay one click  \n&gt; shopping) and\n&gt; cause all kinds of problems. Does ReST address this?\n&gt;\nSession IDs in cookies can be hijacked via cross-site scripting  \nattacks, or just sniffed on the network if they are transmitted in  \nplain text. And even if you use HTTP digest authentication, people  \ncan steal usernames and passwords. Have you received any emails from  \nEBay, Amazon, PayPal, Wells Fargo, etc., lately asking you to update  \nyour account information? I expect that such phishing attacks  \nprobably work some small percentage of the time, and if they&#39;re  \nspamming millions of email addresses, usernames and passwords will  \nget stolen.\n\nSo for actions that you want more security on, you may want to use  \nother strategies on top of your primary means of authentication. For  \nexample, perhaps you could always make users type in the credit card  \nnumber. Even if a session gets hijacked, or a password stolen, the  \nblack hat wouldn&#39;t be able to use that person&#39;s credit cards unless  \nhe also stole those. Or if you have a few admin users who are allowed  \nto delete the entire database, or something drastic like that,  \nperhaps make them verify the action in an email. So if a session gets  \nhijacked, or a password stolen, the bandito would also have to steal  \nthe credentials for the email account to delete the database.\n\nBill\n----\nBill Venners\nEditor-in-Chief\nArtima Developer\nhttp://www.artima.com\n\n\n"}}
