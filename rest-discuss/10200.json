Probably just easier to make it explicit.\n\n&gt; also to lead the  \n&gt; user through an alternative flow for the initial setup?\n\nThe initial setup is something that has to be tightly controlled, just like \nthe issuance/signing of certificates.  You need to be able to assure yourself \nthat the user making the request for an authentication &quot;token&quot; (either a cert \nor the special cookie in my scenario) is who they say they are and are \nentitled to the credentials.  In this regard, I don&#39;t see that the setup \nscenario would be something that you would want to automagically redirect to.\nIt would be better for it to be something that was done more manually.  This \nwouldn&#39;t be a big deal since it would be an infrequent event and the user \npopulation size for the apps I&#39;m working on is measured in the dozens so \nvolume of requests isn&#39;t a biggie.\n\nBut back to the question at hand....is the &quot;cookie over SSL&quot; as an \nauthentication &quot;token&quot; secure or are there some holes I haven&#39;t thought of?\n\nThx!\n\n\nAndrzej Jan Taramina\nChaeron Corporation: Enterprise System Solutions\nhttp://www.chaeron.com\n\n\n"}}
