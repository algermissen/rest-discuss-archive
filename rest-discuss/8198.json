Location: /numbers/FOO/1\n&gt; --&gt; POST /numbers/FOO\n&gt; &lt;-- 201 Created. Location: /numbers/FOO/2\n&gt; --&gt; POST /numbers/BAR\n&gt; &lt;-- 201 Created. Location: /numbers/BAR/1\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Note that the &#39;next&#39; part of the request resource url is not used, just the namespace/collection\n\nPart of my concern about the POST-centric approach is that it is\nimplicit in all the proposals in favour that the POST request has no\nbody (please correct me if I am wrong).\n\nAccording to http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.5\n&quot;The POST method is used to request that the origin server accept the\nentity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource\nidentified by the Request-URI in the Request-Line.&quot;\n\nSo the spec (implicitly) expects a POST to carry a entity body. What\nshould the body be for the following example?\n\n--&gt; POST /numbers/FOO\n&lt;-- 201 Created. Location: /numbers/FOO/1\n\nPerhaps\n\nPOST /numbers/FOO\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\naction=new\n\nThe advantage of this is that it makes the operation explicit, the\ndisadvantage is that it smells awfully like &quot;tunnelling via POST&quot; (as\ndoes the &#39;empty POST&#39; approach but it is less obvious there).\n\nRegards,\nAlan Dean\nhttp://thoughtpad.net/who/alan-dean/\n\n"}}
