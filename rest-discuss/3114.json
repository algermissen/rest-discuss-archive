So far, I haven&#39;t seen a\nconvincing argument why PUT can&#39;t be symmetric to GET (setting specific\nrepresentations). However I agree that it&#39;s probably better to assign\ndistinct URIs to each variant (making authoring of them more\nstraightforward), but I fail to see where RFC2616 (as published!) requires\nthis.\n\nJulian\n\n\n[1] &lt;http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/2002Sep/0047.html&gt;\n\n--\n&lt;green/&gt;bytes GmbH -- http://www.greenbytes.de -- tel:+492512807760\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Walden Mathews [mailto:waldenm@...]\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, December 24, 2002 9:40 PM\n&gt; To: cmhinson@...\n&gt; Cc: rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] Future proof\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Chuck,\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for the reference to the Roy message.\n&gt;\n&gt; I see two issues here, worth separating.  There is the notion of\n&gt; a resource\n&gt; capable of delivering out a variety of different representations\n&gt; at a single\n&gt; point in time, that variety being the space in which content\n&gt; negotiation may\n&gt; take place.\n&gt;\n&gt; There is another issue, closer to &quot;equivalence&quot; (which causes trouble in\n&gt; other areas as well, it seems.  I PUT this representation to this URI, and\n&gt; it\n&gt; replaces any existing representations.  That means that upon the\n&gt; completion\n&gt; of PUT, that resource has but one representation.\n&gt;\n&gt; But when we say &quot;one representation&quot;, we&#39;re not also spelling out the\n&gt; rules for what would distinguish one from two.  If characters are present,\n&gt; does case matter?  ASCII or other?  If the representation consists of a\n&gt; &quot;bag&quot; of things, does literality force an unintended ordering on\n&gt; that?  And\n&gt; so on.\n&gt;\n&gt; When Roy says that 2616 &quot;PUT&quot; method specifies that PUT obliterates\n&gt; variance of representation, I believe the language of 2616 reasonably\n&gt; supports his assertion.  If he were asserting that 2616 PUT\n&gt; method specifies\n&gt; literality, I&#39;d have to say that my careful readings so far can&#39;t\n&gt; find that.\n&gt;\n&gt; There&#39;s another problem here, in that the great majority of web\n&gt; application\n&gt; developers don&#39;t have access to Roy to to his email conversations, and\n&gt; so those resources don&#39;t quality as part of the standard, unfortunately.\n&gt; We need to approach that problem with care, I think.\n&gt;\n&gt; Walden\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;Chuck Hinson&quot; &lt;cmhinson@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &quot;Walden Mathews&quot; &lt;waldenm@...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, December 24, 2002 11:35 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] Future proof\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Walden Mathews wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I remember reading on this list (if I&#39;m not mistaken), that\n&gt; PUT should\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;store the document as is, and you should be able to retrieve the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;unchanged document through a GET.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Reading that on this list doesn&#39;t make it true.  This is not\n&gt; clear in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;language of 2616, and so I question its status as &quot;standard&quot;.\n&gt; Generally,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;resources, according to REST, are functions that map time to values,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;and there are no constraints in REST saying that resource values may\n&gt; &gt; &gt;only be changed via the HTTP interface.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;If someone can find, somewhere in the body of standards, clear\n&gt; &gt; &gt;language to the effect that the resource implementation is expected to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;store a PUT value in bit-literal form, and that a subsequent GET on\n&gt; &gt; &gt;a resource that has suffered a PUT at some time in its life is required\n&gt; &gt; &gt;to serve out bit-literal representations...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s not quite that limiting strict.  The interpretation presented\n&gt; &gt; earlier on this list was that given no intervening operations between a\n&gt; &gt; PUT and a GET (and assuming no other mechanism changes the resource&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; state),  a GET should return the exact representation submitted by the\n&gt; &gt; immediately previous PUT.  Note, however,  that once a representation\n&gt; &gt; has been PUT, there&#39;s nothing that says the state of the resource can&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; be changed by some other means.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;If someone finds that, would they please give me a pointer?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; We can certainly argue about what the spec actually says vs what one or\n&gt; &gt; more of it&#39;s authors intended . However, Roy Fielding has made at least\n&gt; &gt; one statement[1] that I (and I believe others) interpret to mean what I\n&gt; &gt; stated above.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/2002Sep/0046.html\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --Chuck\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; rest-discuss-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
