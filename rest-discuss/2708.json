Coupling is reduced, but not because identity\nis removed from the connector interface - you still need to know the\nidentity of the &quot;bus&quot; 8-) - but because you don&#39;t need to know about\nthe identity of the publishers.\n\nAnyhow, think of it that way; the bus/channel/topic as a resource.\nThen visit http://developer.knownow.com. 8-)\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker, CTO, Idokorro Mobile (formerly Planetfred)\nOttawa, Ontario, CANADA.               distobj@...\nhttp://www.markbaker.ca        http://www.idokorro.com\n\n"}}
