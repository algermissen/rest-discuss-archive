(OK, they might need wrapp=\r\ning up in DTOs or projections to allow client/server to evolve differently,=\r\n but that&#39;s a different point).\n\nAnyway, my question is: can someone unpack=\r\n Roy&#39;s statement for me?  What is the difference between what Roy calls &quot;ap=\r\nplication state&quot; (which he says isn&#39;t a resource) vs use case state (which =\r\nmay here seem to consider is perfectly legit as a resource).\n\nthx\nDan\n\n[1] =\r\nhttp://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven#comme=\r\nnt-744\n\n\n"}}
