Originally, the client had a series of URIs that more or less\n&gt;mapped to several of the URIs above.  However, this was getting confusing,\n&gt;since I needed additional things like edit windows and\n&gt;\n&gt;/client?uri={uri}\n&gt;    Auth-GET returns the appropriate resource representation\n&gt;    {uri} must be one of the URIs in the second group above. The\n&gt;    &quot;/{id}/access&quot; URI would be the &quot;main&quot; URI, which would return\n&gt;    the entry page, main menu, etc.\n&gt;/client/addform?uri={uri}\n&gt;    Auth-GET returns the appropriate form\n&gt;    Auth-POST submits the form\n&gt;    {uri} must be one of the &quot;container&quot; URIs (e.g. &quot;/{id}/agreements&quot;)\n&gt;    mentioned above that accepts POST (client internally POSTs XML to the\n&gt;    target {uri}).\n&gt;/client/editform?ur={uri}\n&gt;    Auth-GET returns the appropriate form\n&gt;    Auth-POST submits the form\n&gt;    {uri} must be one of the individual resource URIs (e.g.\n&gt;    &quot;/{id}/agreements/{abc}&quot;) mentioned above that accepts PUT (client\n&gt;    internally updates using PUT to the target {uri}).\n&gt;/client/delete?uri={uri}\n&gt;\nDid you forget Auth_GET to get the form?\n\n&gt;    Auth-POST submits form\n&gt;    {uri} must be a parent URI of the URI that will be deleted (which is\n&gt;    passed in the form itself).  Response returns the equivalent of\n&gt;    &quot;GET /client?{uri}&quot; (minus the deleted resource).\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nThis looks more or less like the approach that I use as far as treating \nUI element as resources.  I&#39;d probably change the syntax of your URI \nnamespace, but that&#39;s just personal perference (i.e, I cant give a good \nreason why you shouldn&#39;t do it the way you are).\n\n&gt;In general, the idea is that the appropriate screen according to the value\n&gt;of {uri} is returned.  For clarity, look at the following examples:\n&gt;\n&gt;    GET /client?uri={/{id}/access}\n&gt;        returns the main menu options\n&gt;    GET /client?uri={/{id}/settings}\n&gt;        returns a static view of the current settings.\n&gt;    GET /client/editform?uri={/{id}/settings}\n&gt;        returns a form for editing changes.\n&gt;    GET /client?uri={/{id}/agreements}\n&gt;        returns a static list of the agreements.\n&gt;    GET /client/addform?uri={/{id}/agreements}\n&gt;        returns form to add an agreement.\n&gt;    etc.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nThese seem fine, although I personally would change the structure of the \nURIs to something like\n   GET /client/menu?id={id}\n   GET /client/settingsviewer?id={id}\n   GET /client/settingseditor?id={id}\n   GET /client/agreementsviewer?id={id}\n   GET /client/agreementscreator?id={id}\n\nAgain, this is just a reflection of the way I&#39;m doing things now - I \ncan&#39;t give any justification for doing it one way or the other (other \nthan it makes more sense to me).  (It also assumes that I haven&#39;t \nmisinterpreted the intent of the examples you gave.)\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n\n"}}
