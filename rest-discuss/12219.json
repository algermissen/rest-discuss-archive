The server must track multiple operations\n&gt; before responding to the client, and do this reliably in case of\n&gt; interruption; both issues are cleanly avoided in a REST request, where\n&gt; the contents of the request entity never contain protocol-level\n&gt; instructions for the server to carry out.\n\nState within one operation may exist, but it&#39;s internal to the server and\nit&#39;s implementation. One server will often keep state around while it goes\nand create multiple new resources on a simple action invoked through a POST\nand I don&#39;t hear anyone complain about it.\n\nIf a resource creation can engender many other resources being created, why\nwould the deletion of one resource ending up in many resources being deleted\nbe an issue?\n\n\n\n\n"}}
