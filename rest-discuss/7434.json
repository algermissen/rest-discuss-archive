It\nis perhaps peculiar that resources don&#39;t always exist within the server.\nSometimes they are implemented as objects in their own right, but other\ntimes a single object might offer many resources or vice versa.\nResources themselves exist between clients and servers as a shared\ninterface concept.\n\nThese different resources all _demarcate_ related _application state_ on\nthe server side. Each resource selects a piece of state (ie information)\nin the server that might be part of a single object, might be a whole\nobject, or might be parts of several different objects. If we were\ntalking about databases a resource might demarcate a subset of rows\nacross multiple tables.\n\nWhen we GET a resource, we retrieve a _representation_ of that resource.\nThis representation is a document that contains the information\ndemarcated by the resource. The same resource might choose to return its\nstate in several formats, providing several different representations of\nits state. Different representations may offer different levels of\nsemantic fidelity. For example, atom data could be returned in a simple\ncsv or text file... but then the information couldn&#39;t be used in a news\nreader client application.\n\nBenjamin.\n\n\n"}}
