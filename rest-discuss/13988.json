I thought you were talking about not looking\n&gt; inside the body for performance reasons.  HTTP is designed so that\n&gt; an intermediary doesn&#39;t have to look inside the body (for performance\n&gt; reasons), but that is not a constraint of REST and thus it is common\n&gt; to have intermediaries that do want to look inside the body.\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n\nI think there is an additional benefit, beyond performance gains, \nderived from requiring a system&#39;s intermediary/connector controls to be \nrepresented as protocol-level metadata (i.e. HTTP headers) - since this \nremoves a system specific burden (of self-descriptiveness) on media \ntypes, and therefore promotes flexibility in terms of how resources can \nbe represented over time.\n\nSuch as system would not necessarily prevent duplication of this \ninformation within specific media types, if required - although there \nwould be some cost associated with ensuring this enveloped information \nwithin the body is consistent with the &#39;authoritative&#39; information in \nthe accompanying headers.\n\n\n- Mike\n\n"}}
