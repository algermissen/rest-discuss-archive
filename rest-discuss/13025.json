Not the only solution, though.\n\n- Mike\n\nAntï¿½nio Mota wrote:\n&gt; Mike Kelly wrote:\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; The uniformity of DELETE is essentially that it is non-safe and \n&gt;&gt; idempotent\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; From the spec: &quot;The client cannot be guaranteed that the operation has \n&gt;&gt; been carried out, even if the status code returned from the origin \n&gt;&gt; server indicates that the action has been completed successfully&quot;. The \n&gt;&gt; spec  mentions 202 (Accepted) as an acceptable response; which would \n&gt;&gt; result in a situation where a &#39;successful&#39; (2xx) DELETE will not \n&gt;&gt; necessarily result in a subsequent GET returning 404.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; With your proposed &#39;uniform&#39; DELETE pattern there is also a real \n&gt;&gt; possibility that some other agent somewhere will &#39;reinstate&#39; the \n&gt;&gt; resource in between the time it takes you to receive the DELETE \n&gt;&gt; response and reissue the subsequent GET - which, from the client&#39;s \n&gt;&gt; perspective, results in the exact same behavior as the &#39;hack&#39; anyway. \n&gt;&gt; This is the reason I don&#39;t think that interpretation of DELETE gains \n&gt;&gt; you anything.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Mike\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; Bill and Sam were discussing what I was trying to say about the DELETE, \n&gt; maybe I couldn&#39;t make myself clear probably because I&#39;m far for being a \n&gt; good english speaker.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bill Burke wrote:\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; Sam Johnston wrote:\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Bill,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; As a matter of interest, are the individual entries available (e.g. \n&gt;&gt;&gt; at /cache/123 or /cache/data/123)? I don&#39;t really grok/like this \n&gt;&gt;&gt; /cache/data idea - /cache is the resource and cache entries should be \n&gt;&gt;&gt; subordinates (which you can retrieve, delete, etc. individually).\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Say this &quot;cache&quot; is a queue (for a real world example of a similar \n&gt;&gt;&gt; problem), and you can create as many queues as you want (e.g. \n&gt;&gt;&gt; /queue/123)... there is now a need to be able to permanently delete \n&gt;&gt;&gt; the queue such that attempting to submit messages fails. If we&#39;ve \n&gt;&gt;&gt; already used DELETE for flushing then we&#39;re in trouble. Plus, if \n&gt;&gt;&gt; there&#39;s parameters (e.g. capacity) then recreation after a DELETE \n&gt;&gt;&gt; should reset those. In that case &quot;curl -X POST \n&gt;&gt;&gt; http://example.com/queue/123/_flush \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;http://example.com/queue/123/_flush&gt;&quot; seems appropriate to me.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Compaction&gt;: \n&gt;&gt;&gt; http://example.com/my_db/_compact &lt;http://example.com/my_db/_compact&gt;.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt;&gt; I see what you&#39;re saying.  There&#39;s a possibility of having the need to \n&gt;&gt; overload DELETE, so don&#39;t use DELETE.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     \n\n\n"}}
