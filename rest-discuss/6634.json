The last paragraph in\nparticular, seems out of place with the rest.\n\nAll of your answers have helped to clarify this all to me greatly,\nhowever I still have a few vague points.\n\nLets say I a collection resource at /vehicles/fleet1 that I&#39;ve created\nby doing a POST to /vehicles, and a vehicle resource\nat /vehicles/fleet1/vehicle1 which I&#39;ve created by doing a POST\nto /vehicles/fleet1. Now if I want to change a property of fleet1\n(something in its content), then I should do a PUT to /vechicles/fleet1,\ncorrect? Does this affect vehicle1? Should it?\n\n(Sorry for the double post Mark.)\nOn Tue, 2006-10-03 at 22:42 -0400, Mark Baker wrote:\n&gt; Since this is a FAQ, perhaps pointing to the RESTwiki&#39;s RestFaq page\n&gt; would be in order;\n&gt; \n&gt; http://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?RestFaq#nid1UP\n&gt; \n&gt; I recommend Elliotte&#39;s explanation, linked there.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mark.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n\n\n"}}
