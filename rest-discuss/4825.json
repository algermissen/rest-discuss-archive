This fundamentally subverts the reason for having different\n&gt;  HTTP methods in the first place...\n&gt;\n&gt;  REST as realized by the Web is (thankfully) about more than GET and\n&gt;  POST.\n\nThese resources would *only* be used by crippled HTML browsers. \nProgrammatic access by developers not using a browser could use the \nappropriate HTTP methods on the actual resources.\n\nSandeep said that he &quot;interpreted&quot; POST-s to these &quot;browser specific \nresources&quot; as PUT-s to the actual resources. In fact, theres&#39; no reason \nwhy you can&#39;t actually implement code that does an actual PUT or DELETE \nor whatever to the &quot;real&quot; resource when a POST is made to one of the \n&quot;fake&quot; resources.\n\nThis isn&#39;t a limitation of the REST architectural style but a limitation \nof some of the tools we have to deal with (I&#39;m considering the browser a \ntool).\n\n-- Jason\n\n"}}
