So there are variations for things like\n&gt; apache muse and other SOAP-based services.\n&gt; \n&gt; But, the little JSP page doesnt set the cache expiry info. So while it\n&gt; works well for dev systems on the local net, if you go live with\n&gt; something beyond the firewall, or if you are trying to do interop\n&gt; tests against remote systems, checking for happyaxis only shows you if\n&gt; the proxy server has, at some point in the past, been publishing a\n&gt; status page.\n\nNot even remote. I&#39;ve been bitten by the same kind of problem in production:\n\n  - when someone set an admin page for Servlet timer to stop/start using \nGET (once it didn&#39;t start at all resulting an a very awkward meeting; \nanother time it didn&#39;t stop, so two timers ended up running after a \n&#39;restart&#39;  screwing up the internal app state).\n\n  - when someone set a batch job control using an .asp page to be \nstarted using GET (the browser returned from cache, never got to the \norigin server).\n\n  - when the Tomcat team thinks you should manage webapp lifecycles \nusing links. Tomcat is the Servlets *RI* for heaven&#39;s sake.\n\nI was listening to drunkandretired 93 a few nights ago. It seems the \nRails crowd still think GWA is evil broken software, and the Rails use \nof GET links is fine (this months after the &quot;world of resources&quot; shift). \nI said last week how could people not understand REST until now, that I \nthought it was willful disregard by the technical community due to \ncommercial &#39;on message&#39; pressures; and now those are fading, people can \nout safely.  But I wonder.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
