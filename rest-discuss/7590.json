Yes, they may have mostly the same\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; content but they have different breadcrumbs which mean one can&#39;t be\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; cached and served for the other.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Just because you navigated to a location circuitously doesn&#39;t\n&gt;  &gt; mean you&#39;d want to see that path reflected in your\n&gt;  &gt; breadcrumbs. You probably want canonicalized breadcrumbs. You\n&gt;  &gt; have a back button if you want to retrace your steps; you\n&gt;  &gt; have breadcrumbs to navigate the site.\n&gt; \n&gt; To paraphrase Dan Connolly, I think you and I are on different planets.\n\nActually, that&#39;s not unreasonable from a usability/accessibility \nperspective. There&#39;s no need to have your site walk reflected in the \nbreadcrumb, and there is something to be said for &#39;static&#39; breadcrumbs \nthat indicate the site&#39;s IA. This is more important today, as many \npeople are dropped straight into a site via a search engine.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
