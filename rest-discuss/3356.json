To require modifying the URI to get the metadata could modify the se=\r\nrvice, or even select a different service.  So, given only the service&#39;s UR=\r\nL, you can either hit the service, and discard all the response except some=\r\n header like MetaData-URI: /some-resource/metadata, which would seem an unn=\r\necessarily wasteful invocation of the service just to get that URI.  Or, yo=\r\nu can pass some parameter in the request (as a header) specifying that you =\r\ndon&#39;t want to invoke the service, but only want to get its metadata (or, as=\r\n you suggest, a reference to the metadata).\n\nI can&#39;t think of any other way=\r\n to get to the metadata given only the service&#39;s URI and without altering i=\r\nt.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Jeffrey Winter [mailto:JeffreyWinter@c=\r\nrd.com] \nSent: Friday, February 14, 2003 6:04 AM\nTo: Zylstra, Jay; rest-dis=\r\ncuss@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [rest-discuss] Re: REST Resource Discover=\r\ny\n\n\n&gt; Why not access all of the various functionality of a service \n&gt; by sp=\r\necifying different ACCEPT values on the request? \n\nThere are two basic issu=\r\nes, the most fundamental of which\nis that the metadata should be a standalo=\r\nne resource with\nit&#39;s own URI so that all normal HTTP methods can be \nappli=\r\ned to it.\n\nThe other issue, which is sort of a by-product of the first,\nis =\r\nthat the scheme that you&#39;ve outlined wouldn&#39;t allow any\nnatural way to disc=\r\nover the meta-metadata (the metadata of \nthe metdata) and on up the potenti=\r\nal chain of descriptive \nresources.\n\nI agree though with the notion of usin=\r\ng the Accept: header\nto obtain the type of metadata of interest, but only \n=\r\nonce the URI of the metadata has been determined [1], a la:\n\n    GET /some-=\r\nresource/metadata HTTP/1.1\n    Host: someplace\n    Accept: application/rdf+=\r\nxml\n    \n    HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n    Content-Type: application/rdf+xml\n    Cont=\r\nent-Location: /some-resource/metadata/rdf\n\n[1]  http://www.xfront.com/dist-=\r\nreg/distributed-registry.html\n    \n\n"}}
