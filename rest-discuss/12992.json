What is worth a URI without representation? What does it \nidentifies?\n\nAlso, if you have in the same application a DELETE that deletes a \nresource and not the URI and other DELETE that deletes both, then DELETE \nisn&#39;t uniform any more.\n\nSo basically I wouldn&#39;t use a DELETE that deletes resources and not it&#39;s \nassociated URI&#39;s, for that I would use PUT&lt;empty&gt;, meaning I&#39;m not \nactually deleting the resource but simply emptying, or flushing it. But \nI&#39;m not saying using it is &quot;wrong&quot;...\n\nMike Kelly wrote:\n&gt; Ant�nio Mota wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Putting it in other words that seems to imply that a GET after a \n&gt;&gt; DELETE should always return 404, not a 200 (providing the DELETE was \n&gt;&gt; successful).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; It definitely doesn&#39;t say that in the spec!\n&gt;\n&gt; Besides, how could that client be aware of whether a given removed URI \n&gt; was not reinstated immediately by another agent somewhere?\n\n\n"}}
