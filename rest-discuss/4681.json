Amazon have since adopted the term themselves although their own\ndocumentation still says that SOAP is more powerful, though with no\njustification given for this.\n\nSince then the fact that the non-SOAP interface is both more popular and\napparently more efficient has been cited several times as evidence that REST\nis superior than SOAP (I&#39;m pretty certain this claim first appeared on one\nof the O&#39;Reilly-hosted blogs).\n\nI started an examination of just how RESTful Amazon&#39;s web services are on\nthe wiki once a long time ago when I (unusually) had some free time on my\nhands, but I haven&#39;t gotten around to adding to it. I did manage to examine\nAmazon&#39;s service as far as it goes for providing information to users (the\nGET stuff) and I think I managed to show both that it wasn&#39;t RESTful, and\nthat using a RESTful service instead would have practical advantages (which\nwould seem to mean that SOAP didn&#39;t just suck compared to a RESTful service,\nbut sucked compared to something that sucked compared to a RESTful\nservice...).\n\nSo Amazon aren&#39;t so much co-opting the term, as being told they were doing\nREST and saying, &quot;uh, ok, cool&quot;.\n\nRegards,\nJon Hanna\nWork: &lt;http://www.selkieweb.com/&gt;\nPlay: &lt;http://www.hackcraft.net/&gt;\nChat: &lt;irc://irc.freenode.net/selkie&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
