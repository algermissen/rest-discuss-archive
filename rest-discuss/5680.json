I work on middleware at IBM. Suppose I\n&gt; used REST as my =\r\nprotocol for accessing data stored in a database.\n&gt;\n\nThis isn&#39;t really nitp=\r\nicking, honest: REST is an architectural style.\nHTTP is an application prot=\r\nocol. Good HTTP apps are usually RESTful.\n\nMost of your questions below see=\r\nm most related to HTTP.\n\n\n&gt; On the surface, looks like a good match but how=\r\n do I use REST to make\n&gt; multiple updates in a single atomic operation?\n\ns/=\r\nREST/HTTP/. You have to determine what a &quot;resource&quot; is in your\nmodel. For u=\r\npdating  resources you&#39;d normally use PUT, but if they\nmust update atomical=\r\nly you can use POST with some custom xml.\n\n&gt;I can see how I&#39;d pull\n&gt; the en=\r\ntry for bnewport from a cache, but what about all the records\n&gt; whose age i=\r\ns &gt; 37?\n&gt;\n\nWell it&#39;s up to you whether you want to build a system that defi=\r\nnes\nURIs ending in a query string.\n\n\n&gt; What about pulling bnewport and jack=\r\nwilson, for example, in one RPC?\n&gt; Looks like the REST stuff cannot deal wi=\r\nth multiple records per server\n&gt; interaction\n\nTry not to think of it as RPC=\r\n. You just GET, PUT, POST, DELETE\nresources. Google returns you multiple re=\r\ncords all the time, right?\n\n&gt; and if performance doesn&#39;t matter than I coul=\r\nd solve it\n&gt; using multiple RPCs but alas, thats rarely the case.\n&gt;\n\n I thi=\r\nnk you meant &quot;round trips&quot;, and yeah, it&#39;s worth spending some\ntime elimina=\r\nting round trips.\n\n&gt; There&#39;s also the atomic multiple update issue. I see l=\r\nots of\n&gt; advantages for using REST as a data-client -&gt; data server protocol=\r\n.\n&gt; How do I do transactions using REST? begin, updates, commit?\n&gt;\n\nAgain, =\r\nHTTP. There&#39;s really not a built in mechanism to do\ntransactions in HTTP. I=\r\n can imagine POSTing some form with URIs I want\nto modify, to create a tran=\r\nsaction resource, the returned entity\ntelling me URLs I can use to do the u=\r\npdates. Then maybe when I&#39;m done\nchanging them, PUT the tx resource back wi=\r\nth a flag saying &quot;commit&quot;,\nor maybe DELETE it.  I&#39;m not saying this is a go=\r\nod idea. But that&#39;s a\nkind of RESTful approach.\n\n\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt;\n\nA lot of the =\r\nquestions you are raising are being addressed by the\nAtompub working group:=\r\n\n\nhttp://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/FrontPage\n\n\n\n--\nHugh Winkler\nWellsto=\r\nrm Development\n\nhttp://www.wellstorm.com/\n+1 512 694 4795 mobile (preferred=\r\n)\n+1 512 264 3998 office\n\n"}}
