I hope it&#39;s still relevant\n-- I encounter the use case every day.\n\nSebastien is right that we should develop an understanding around\nreturn 202 from GET. Subbu said &quot;The behavior of 202 is defined for\nPOST and DELETE only&quot;, but actually, 2616 does not mention any\nparticular methods 202 should apply to.\n\nI think the spec on 202 is kind of muddy.\n\nI had remarked in a blog  [1] that 202 is a good response to the GET\nthe user agent performs on the Location header from a previous 303.\nCurrent user agents just treat that 202 like a 2xx and display the\nentity, so no harm done. Savvy client code, however, can interpret the\n202 as an instruction to try again later.\n\nWidespread interpretation of 202 for GET this way would be dang\nuseful, does anyone else think so, or object ?\n\nHugh\n\n\n[1] http://hughw.blogspot.com/2008/06/asynchronous-http-post.html\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Sep 9, 2008 at 4:40 PM, Sebastien Lambla &lt;seb@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; [...]\n&gt; &gt; (a) overloading 202 in an unspecified manner, and\n&gt; &gt; (b) merging an auxiliary resource with the actual resource. The later\n&gt; &gt; could be confusing to client application developers.\n&gt;\n&gt; I agree with (a) to a certain extent as it does extend ever so slightly the\n&gt; current definition. B however would seem to work fine: a 202&#39;s entity may\n&gt; contain a body with a representation that is not the representation\n&gt; retrieved from the resource identified by the uri, specifically because\n&gt; that&#39;s what the rfc defines the entity body as being. I agree however that\n&gt; such confusion would need to be cleared.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; For instance, take a purchase order that needs to go through some\n&gt; &gt; backend processing (may be even manual) to get created completely.\n&gt; &gt; This could be modeled as a regular 200 OK but keep changing relevant\n&gt; &gt; parts of the representation to reflect its current status. There is no\n&gt; &gt; need for a 202 here.\n&gt;\n&gt; I completely agree and it depends on the semantics of the resource. An order\n&gt; resource certainly gets created when you start adding items to it. The\n&gt; interesting case of a backup in that sense is that the backup may or may not\n&gt; be created successfully. You could simply split those two entities, with the\n&gt; backup entry and the backup data being two different resources, with the\n&gt; backup entry being created on demand and the backup data being eventually\n&gt; created later, updating the backup entry. But in that case, the backup data\n&gt; will only get assigned, and as such only exist for the client, if and when\n&gt; the process has been completed.\n&gt;\n&gt; As I highlighted in the other thread, the issue here is not about creating\n&gt; the backup entry resource itself, that problem is easily solved. The\n&gt; question simply bogs down to the following question: Can you assign a URI\n&gt; for a resource that has not been realised yet and may not be.\n&gt;\n&gt; If a sidekick resource always needs to be created to support giving progress\n&gt; on a long-running realisation of a resource, maybe it is the case that an\n&gt; acknowledgement that such resource exists but is in an undefined state, with\n&gt; an entity being returned to define when it may become available (or be\n&gt; processed), is a good candidate for reuse at the http, rather than the app,\n&gt; level. And 202 seems to be fitting well enough. But of course it could be\n&gt; solved with Link headers and a custom definition of the rel, with\n&gt; human-readable or machine-readable content returned on the original 202 and\n&gt; the sidekick resource, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure they&#39;re more or less rest however. If a client has only\n&gt; knowledge of http, the 202 solution will work because no polling would be\n&gt; automatic and the various requests would still function. The solution still\n&gt; requires to process the entity body (or the link header) to discover the\n&gt; link from the initial 202 response, which you would have to understand\n&gt; anyway. The further 202 on GET for a client not aware would essentially\n&gt; display the entity saying &quot;Estimated finish time in 5 minutes&quot;. Using a 200\n&gt; on GET on the sidekick resource would do exactly the same thing. The main\n&gt; difference here would be that the status resource would eventually have to\n&gt; let you know where the resource can be found, and because the resource exist\n&gt; as a whole, it should have this in the entity being returned. Then comes the\n&gt; question of the value of keeping around a second resource to describe the\n&gt; status when the process has completed. Because you gave that first uri,\n&gt; you&#39;ll have to define when you expire it, and probably keep it around for as\n&gt; long as the resource itself exists.\n&gt;\n&gt; Seb\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
