My \nthesis is base=\r\nd on a mapping framework transforming XML Web Services (both SOAP \nand POX)=\r\n to RESTful HTTP format. This framework has two stages: a) a \nconfiguration=\r\n stage that sets up a mapping file and b) a run-time adapter that \ntransfor=\r\nms the messages based on the mapping file. \n\n    The advantages are that th=\r\nis framework enables the Web architecture (POST \ncan be replaced with GET i=\r\nn certain situations); the framework helps with \ngradual migration from SOA=\r\nP/POX to RESTful HTTP WS. It has constraints of \ncourse, principally: URI l=\r\nimits for GET/DELETE and SOAP/POX POSTs which map \nlogically to multiple RE=\r\nSTful URI&#39;s are left untouched (i.e. as a POST).\n    Where the Semantic Web=\r\n comes into it is in the mapping file that informs the \nrun-time adapter. T=\r\nhe first version had a manual setup where the user matched  \nthe XML WS ope=\r\nrations to RESTful HTTP verbs. The second/current version uses the \nSemanti=\r\nc Web to automate this process. Currently, I use SAWSDL for the XML WS \nsid=\r\ne and hRESTS/MicroWSMO on the RESTful WS side. A tool called Core Dashboard=\r\n \nenables me to annotate both services [1]. Both sides point to the &quot;concep=\r\ntually&quot; \nhigher semantic ontology layer (WSMO-Lite is the standard I use fo=\r\nr this layer). \n\n    In my thesis I will have to cover the alternatives and=\r\n originally SA-REST \nappeared to be that. However, the W3C submission is di=\r\nfferent to earlier \npublications. My information is that it is a microforma=\r\nt (hRESTS/MicroWSMO) \nversus RDFa (RDFa/SA-REST) option. So if that is the =\r\ncase is my logic below \ncorrect:\n\n\t1. It would appear that SA-REST is equiv=\r\nalent to (hRESTS + MicroWSMO). It has a \nservice model similar to hRESTS an=\r\nd using the SA-REST properties (domain-rel, \nsem-rel and sem-class) can poi=\r\nnt to the semantic layer (as MicroWSMO does).\n\t2. Then using RDFa, SA-REST =\r\nhas the ability to be serialised from XHTML as  \nRDF.\nThanks again,\nSean.\n\n=\r\nPS A lifting is an XSLT transformation that maps e.g. a SOAP message to the=\r\n \n&quot;conceptually higher&quot; semantic layer (an RDF file); a lowering is the opp=\r\nosite. \n\n\n[1] Core Dashboard, http://coconut.tie.nl:8080/dashboard/#1304670=\r\n463179\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n From: Eric J.

Since I don&#39;t see the point of an  IDL when=\r\n using the\nhypertext constraint, I don&#39;t see the point of IDL-as-microforma=\r\nt,\neither.  I&#39;ve also never seen the point of a machine-readable service\ndo=\r\ncument as an endpoint user-agents need to consult before taking\naction -- w=\r\nhat results is some other architectural style (where the\nsemantics of the U=\r\nRI mappings vary based on some hash table at an\n&quot;entry point&quot; URI, instead =\r\nof remaining RESTfully static).\n\nSo I can&#39;t answer your questions, since I =\r\ndon&#39;t know how this &quot;fits in&quot;\nwith REST, either.  What hRESTS/SA-REST look =\r\nlike to me, is kludged-in\ntooling support to more efficiently produce the H=\r\nTTP APIs most folks\n*call* REST APIs these days.  Remember, I don&#39;t judge A=\r\nPIs by whether\nthey&#39;re RESTful, only how well they&#39;re suited to their purpo=\r\nses, so I&#39;m\nnot scorning any project which may result in better APIs -- my =\r\n*opinion*\nis that this approach may even lead some people _to_ REST&#39;s  hype=\r\nrtext\nconstraint, so it&#39;s probably a good thing, just mis-labeled.\n\nWe&#39;ve a=\r\nlso discussed machine-readability many times; there are those\nwho prefer ma=\r\nchine-targeted data types, and those who prefer RDFa.  I\nsee RDFa as a supe=\r\nrior solution to microformats, for any purpose, and\nhRESTS is another examp=\r\nle of why -- instead of a general-purpose parsing\nmodel, each microformat h=\r\nas its own unique parsing model, usually\ndefined as XSLT -- as is the case =\r\nwith hRESTS/SA-REST, which GRDDL-maps\nits microformat to RDF, begging the q=\r\nuestion &quot;why not just use RDFa?&quot;\n\nInteroperability is a concern; modular XH=\r\nTML encompasses Xforms, which\ngives the ability to &quot;describe&quot; more HTTP-met=\r\nhod-rich APIs, but those\ntokens collide with hRESTS -- which really shouldn=\r\n&#39;t use class=3D&#39;label&#39;\nbecause that collides with &lt;label&gt;, as well.  The re=\r\nason it&#39;s easier to\ncreate RDF vocabularies than it is to create markup  la=\r\nnguages (or even\nmicroformats), is the vocabulary author doesn&#39;t have to wo=\r\nrry about if\nbrowsers&#39; javascript forms-modules reserve &#39;label&#39; as a keywor=\r\nd, etc.\n\nIn a nutshell, I don&#39;t see how using hRESTS/SA-REST would result i=\r\nn the\nRESTful APIs I&#39;ve done using Xforms/RDFa; although by solving what I\n=\r\nwho doesn&#39;t use tooling for API development considers a non-problem, I\ncan =\r\nsee how I could&#39;ve produced functionally-equivalent HTTP APIs in a\nfraction=\r\n of the time.  Which seems to be the problem with any effort to\nmass-produc=\r\ne RESTful APIs, what&#39;s lost in translation is all the design-\nfor-longevity=\r\n goodness which distinguishes REST APIs from HTTP APIs.\n\nThe hRESTS/SA-REST=\r\n approach intrigues me from an HTTP tinkerer\nperspective, supporting server=\r\n-parsed server-configuration-on-the-fly.\nOn one hand, this would philosophi=\r\ncally violate separation of concerns;\nOTOH, long-term maintenance of Web sy=\r\nstems based on  static files may\nbenefit from having fewer files to edit.\n\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. Where does SA-REST fit in? The service model [1] looks very\n&gt; simila=\r\nr to the service model of hRESTS [2]. According to the diagram\n&gt; at the sta=\r\nrt of  [2], SA-REST sits on top of hRESTS - why then does\n&gt; SA-REST  define=\r\n a similar service model? \n&gt; \n\nPerhaps you should ask this of the authors, =\r\nsince they&#39;re the same?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. According to [2], SA-REST supports faceted =\r\nsearch. Where are\n&gt; &quot;p-lang-binding&quot; and &quot;data-format&quot; [2] coming from? Why=\r\n is there no\n&gt; mention of them in the W3C Submission ? [3].\n&gt;\n\nThat is a go=\r\nod question, and if it&#39;s machine readable, then where are\nthose tokens like=\r\n PHP and Java defined and how is versioning accounted\nfor?  I understand th=\r\ne problem of mashing up services which use\ndifferent formats, but I don&#39;t u=\r\nnderstand the rationale of solving this\nby  making services searchable by d=\r\nata format (or any other &quot;facet&quot;),\nlet alone what it has to do with REST ot=\r\nher than attaching that name to\nnew IBM products which support this feature=\r\n.  Seems like tight coupling\nto me, hence my confusion on calling it REST..=\r\n.\n\nParticularly when their example of a RESTful Web Service is a JSON-RPC\ne=\r\nndpoint.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 3. In its service model [1], there is no  lifting/lowering. H=\r\now is\n&gt; this done when using SA-REST?\n&gt;\n\nWhat *are* lifting and lowering?\n\n=\r\n-Eric\n\n \r\n--0-993007705-1305620632=:92319\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/he=\r\nad&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman,new york,times,serif;fon=\r\nt-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hi Saravan,&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for =\r\nthat.

So if that is the c=\r\nase i&lt;span style=3D&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;s my logic below correct&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt;:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It would appear that SA-REST is equivalent to (hRESTS +=\r\n MicroWSMO). It has a service model similar to hRESTS and using the SA-REST=\r\n properties (&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;domain-rel, sem-rel&lt;/span&gt;=\r\n and &lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;sem-class&lt;/span&gt;) can point to the=\r\n semantic layer (as MicroWSMO does).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Then using RDFa, SA-REST has =\r\nthe ability to be serialised from XHTML as&nbsp; RDF.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;Thanks a=\r\ngain,&lt;br&gt;Sean.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS A lifting is an XSLT transformation that maps e.g.=\r\n a SOAP message to the &quot;conceptually higher&quot; semantic layer (an RDF file); =\r\na lowering is the opposite. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[1] Core Dashboard, &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot;=\r\n target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;  href=3D&quot;http://coconut.tie.nl:8080/dashboard/#130467046=\r\n3179&quot;&gt;http://coconut.tie.nl:8080/dashboard/#1304670463179&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;di=\r\nv style=3D&quot;font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; font-size: 12=\r\npt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:=\r\n 13px;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;\n&lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D=\r\n&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Eric J.

Where does SA-REST fit in? The se=\r\nrvice model [1] looks very&lt;br&gt;&gt; similar to the service model of hRESTS [=\r\n2]. According to the diagram&lt;br&gt;&gt; at the start of&nbsp; [2], SA-REST sit=\r\ns on top of hRESTS - why then does&lt;br&gt;&gt; SA-REST&nbsp; define a similar s=\r\nervice model? &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perhaps you should ask this of the authors, =\r\nsince they&#39;re the same?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; 2. According to [2], SA-REST su=\r\npports faceted search. Where are&lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;p-lang-binding&quot; and &quot;data-format&quot;=\r\n [2] coming from? Why is there no&lt;br&gt;&gt; mention of them in the W3C Submis=\r\nsion ? [3].&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is a good question, and if it&#39;s machine rea=\r\ndable, then where are&lt;br&gt;those tokens like PHP and Java defined and how is =\r\nversioning accounted&lt;br&gt;for?&nbsp; I understand the problem of mashing up s=\r\nervices which use&lt;br&gt;different formats, but I don&#39;t understand the rational=\r\ne of solving this&lt;br&gt;by\n making services searchable by data format (or any =\r\nother &quot;facet&quot;),&lt;br&gt;let alone what it has to do with REST other than attachi=\r\nng that name to&lt;br&gt;new IBM products which support this feature.&nbsp; Seems=\r\n like tight coupling&lt;br&gt;to me, hence my confusion on calling it REST...&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;Particularly when their example of a RESTful Web Service is a JSON-RPC&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;endpoint.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; 3. In its service model [1], there is no&n=\r\nbsp; lifting/lowering. How is&lt;br&gt;&gt; this done when using SA-REST?&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What *are* lifting and lowering?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Eric&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;=\r\n&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--0-993007705-1305620632=:92319--\r\n\n"}}
