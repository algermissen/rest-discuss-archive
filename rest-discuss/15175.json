Its based o=\r\nn the HTTP protocol because it\nwill be the protocol that we foresee will be=\r\n more used (and also has more\nsupport and tools available), but we also for=\r\nesee other use cases that will\nuse LISTEN, like support for JMS protocol vi=\r\na a JMS Connector. And that I\ncan extend if needed by adding new verbs, wit=\r\nhout breaking existing users.\n\nThen we build applications on this architect=\r\nure. We define media-types,\nrelations, resources. One resource of the appli=\r\ncation can make use of GET,\nPOST, PUT, DELETE verbs, another one GET and LI=\r\nSTEN only. None can use verbs\nnon existing in the Uniform Interface, at lea=\r\nst until we deploy Architecture\n2.0 that can extend it with ERASE, for exam=\r\nple.\n\nNote that I use the word Architecture to refer to a actual implementa=\r\ntion of\na achitecture, not only its design. (And that I use the term &quot;I&quot; lo=\r\nosely, as\nall this was/is a collective effort).\n\nThis is not only my unders=\r\ntending but the way we built our infrastructure,\nor midleware, that it has =\r\nnow some good months in production. And that\n&quot;midlware&quot; based on this is pr=\r\nobably the more robust piece of software we\nuse including several 3rd party=\r\n frameworks, with exactly 0 bugs until now\n(even if the fact that it runs, =\r\nfor now, only on the intranet helps). And it\nsupports HTTP, IMAP, JMS, intr=\r\na-VM, JCR protocols.
