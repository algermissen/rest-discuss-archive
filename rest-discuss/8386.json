As an RPC call, it would look\n&gt; something like this:\n&gt;\n&gt; /plotAbundance?site1=HAZARDS&site2=ANACAPA&species1=PCLA&species2=CNIC\n&gt;\n&gt; Basically, its an RPC call that accepts and arbitrary number of sites\n&gt; and species. I really can&#39;t imagine a scheme for doing this with rest.\n&gt; The only thing I could think of is POST+redirect, and cache the image\n&gt; that it is redirected to. Unfortunately, you can&#39;t really encode a\n&gt; POST into an img tag. I would have to do some ajax calls and insert a\n&gt; link to the redirect location.\n\nWhat is particularly RPC (or non-REST) about the above URL? It looks  \nperfectly ordinary to me.\n\n\n"}}
