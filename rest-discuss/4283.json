While I agree with it, I&#39;m wondering just how strong an axiom it\nis, and trying to find any exceptions, caveats or boundaries that might exist.\n\n-- \nJon Hanna\n&lt;http://www.hackcraft.net/&gt;\n&quot;ï¿½it has been truly said that hackers have even more words for\nequipment failures than Yiddish has for obnoxious people.&quot; - jargon.txt\n\n"}}
