In order to  \nmanage this context, the coordinator associates it with writes done by  \neach client. In a sense, this context a sum of client state. Further,  \nmy understanding is that, the most efficient way to manage this  \ntransaction context is by keeping the client-server protocol  \n&quot;connection oriented&quot;. So, when you implement 2PC over a connection- \nless protocol, how is that context managed, other than by treating it  \nas resource state?\n\nSubbu\n\nOn Oct 4, 2009, at 1:01 AM, Bill Burke wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Subbu Allamaraju wrote:\n&gt;&gt; On Oct 2, 2009, at 3:40 PM, Bill Burke wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, somebody will have to explain to me why (or if) the  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Reservation\n&gt;&gt;&gt; example I gave breaks the stateless constraint of REST.  Where I  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; think\n&gt;&gt; Well - under the disguise of a &quot;transaction&quot;, the server is  \n&gt;&gt; maintaining per-client state.\n&gt;\n&gt; There is no per-client state.  A Reservation is interesting to a  \n&gt; Travel Agent, a Customer, and to an Airline.  A credit or debit is  \n&gt; interesting to a Credit Card Account and to the Merchant (and to  \n&gt; Visa and Mastercard).Again, &quot;fulfilled&quot; for a reservation and  \n&gt; &quot;posted/settled&quot; for a credit or debit are valid non-session-based  \n&gt; states.  The fact that these states have a different representation  \n&gt; (a tx-document) shouldn&#39;t matter.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In stead of answering your question directly, let me ask you  \n&gt;&gt; whether have you examined the scalability characteristics of your  \n&gt;&gt; proposed design.\n&gt;\n&gt; Integration scenarios many times require coordination between many  \n&gt; actors.  It should be irrelevant if the client delegates this  \n&gt; coordination to a different service.  All a transaction manager does  \n&gt; is guarantee that something happens, which is hard to implement many  \n&gt; times on a per-application basis.  This is why transaction managers  \n&gt; exist.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It may be worthwhile to start from basics, apply each constraint  \n&gt;&gt; one by one, and whether your approach benefits. The discussion  \n&gt;&gt; around the kind of resources needed, media types, link rels, link  \n&gt;&gt; headers vs link elements in some XML format are implementation  \n&gt;&gt; details. So far, this post does not make a case of why an  \n&gt;&gt; transactional application should be built the way you propose.\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, the way is interesting because the actors being coordinated  \n&gt; can negotiate with the transaction manager on the exact protocol.   \n&gt; For example, the reservation resource is posted with a &quot;transaction&quot;  \n&gt; link. The reservation service can GET that link with an Accept  \n&gt; header of the preferred transaction formats it desires to interact  \n&gt; with.  If the reservation service does not know how to interact with  \n&gt; the transaction representation, it can barf at reservation creation.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Bill Burke\n&gt; JBoss, a division of Red Hat\n&gt; http://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n\n"}}
