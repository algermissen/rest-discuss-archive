This is part of the reason why it&#39;s deprecated in\nXForms. Sending around bits of XML is a much better way to go.&quot;\n\nAnd yes indeed:\n\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/xforms/slice11.html#rpm-send\n\n&quot;The HTTP &quot;get&quot; protocol is deprecated for use in form submission. Form\nauthors should use &quot;post&quot; for greater compatibility.&quot;\n\nInsofar as XForms will most often be used to submit data to be stored,\nthis isn&#39;t a crisis, but when XForms replace HTML forms in general, this\nis going to be a big problem.\n\n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
