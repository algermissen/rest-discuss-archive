I hadn&#39;t looked into the idea of custom headers.  Somehow I\nassumed that wasn&#39;t kosher, since it means the client is assuming\nnon-standard capabilities on the server. I am still lacking in\nrest-fu.\n\n&gt; Afterwards, PUT to the ransaction a representation that sets it to the\n&gt; &#39;commited&#39; state. This could for example be done with an APP control  \n&gt; extension,\n&gt; as in:\n&gt; \n&gt; PUT /transactions/3\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;entry&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;!-- .... --&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;app:control&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;tx:commit&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;/app:control&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/entry&gt;\n\nAha, I hadn&#39;t read section 12 of the protocol draft.\n\n&gt; Note that all this applies only to local transactions\n...\n\nYeah, distributed transactions seems like YAGNI for this project.\nThanks!\n\n-- \n\nPaul Winkler\nhttp://www.slinkp.com\n\n"}}
