If the\n&gt; representation linking to that resource tells the client how to\n&gt; construct the URL, it&#39;s fully discoverable.  If it fails to tell the\n&gt; client how, then the client has no way to construct the URL at all\n&gt; without violating HATEoAS.\n\nI fail to see how the server can instruct the client in any meaningful way\nthat urls in the form of http://server/resource/1,2,3,4 represent a pool of\ndocuments equal to /resource/1, /resource/2 etc. If you want to set that\nconvention up thats fine with me, but it&#39;s just that, a convention specific\nto the way you define your service, and in that it is opaque with low\ndiscoverability.\n\n&gt; REST does require a bit of a mental leap.  But I don&#39;t find &quot;REST is\n&gt; hard, let&#39;s go shopping!&quot; a very convincing argument. :)\n\nI don&#39;t believe I&#39;m making this argument, quite the contrary. The solution\nyou seem to be promoting isn&#39;t more rest than batching requests in one go\nthrough a multipart message. At least with that solution the semantics of\nUrls are respected and still general purpose, as opposed to\nconvention-driven url construction.\n\n&gt; The URL space does not have to be rigid!  Free your mind! :)\n\nThey have to be discoverable and not built by private conventions. I don&#39;t\nbelieve in the value of transient composite Urls that have only meaning when\nin the context of the documentation of your service, be it that it is 1,2,3\nor 1;2;3.\n\nIf you start doing /1,2,3 supporting POST that translates in 3 POSTS to /1,\n/2 and /3, do you support a GET on the same conventional URL? If not you\ndon&#39;t have a uniform interface anymore. If you do, you cannot support things\nlike ETags, caching etc, unless you do it as a collection.\n\nOverall it seems to me it introduces more mess than it solves issues.\n\n--\nSerialSeb \n\n\n"}}
