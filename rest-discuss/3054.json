(the clients to this interface \n&gt; probably wouldn&#39;t be browsers)\n\nSET is PUT plus a hook to a processing model.  The only reason I&#39;m even\nconsidering documenting it is for use with SOAP.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s\nuseful to you here.\n\n&gt; I view POST as &quot;PUT but in append&quot;, so for the creation of new profiles \n&gt; would there be a need for a &quot;SET but in append&quot; method?\n\nPOST is just &quot;hand over this data&quot;.  Unlike PUT/SET, you have no idea\nwhat the state of the resource to which you&#39;re POSTing will be after\nit&#39;s completed.  That&#39;s why the container abstraction represents POST so\nwell, I&#39;ve found, since all you know when you&#39;re dealing with a\ncontainer is that the data was added/submitted to it.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.
