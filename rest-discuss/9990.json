It&#39;s kind\n&gt;&gt; of the point right? You have a resource or some collection of\n&gt;&gt; resources that you want updated. The most flexible way of supporting\n&gt;&gt; update would be to support multiple media types on input.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think there is a difference between offering multiple  \n&gt; representations of a resource via GET and updating the same resource  \n&gt; via a POST/PUT. With POST/PUT, you are creating/changing the  \n&gt; resource itself, not just creating/changing a &quot;representation&quot; of  \n&gt; the resource. Given this, there is reason to offer a symmetry  \n&gt; between GET and POST/PUT. That is, if a GET is capable of returning  \n&gt; application/json, application/xml and text/html, it does not imply  \n&gt; that a POST or PUT should support processing creation/update of the  \n&gt; resource with the payload expressed via the same media types. You  \n&gt; may instead decide to support application/x-www-form-urlencoded if  \n&gt; the clientele is browsers.\n\nI don&#39;t think I understand what you&#39;re trying to say here. I didn&#39;t,  \nor didn&#39;t mean to, suggest that there should be symmetry between media  \ntypes supported for GET and media types supported for POST/PUT. I  \nsimply said that more flexibility is available in the system if POST/ \nPUT can accept multiple media typed representations, do a bit of  \ntransformation (e.g. html -&gt; text), and create/change resources in a  \ncanonical storage form.\n\nOf course a canonical storage form is not strictly necessary, there  \ncould be no transformation, or the transformation could happen at the  \ntime of a GET. The resource being an abstract platonic thingie,  \nuseable multiple forms.\n\nYou can imagine, perhaps, a service that accepts (PUT/POST) documents  \nin a bunch of formats (RTF, Text, HTML, Markdown, textbox from a from)  \nbut only supplies (GET) documents as HTML. Or the other way round. Or  \nboth.\n\nSymmetry of media types isn&#39;t the goal here, flexibly solving a  \nproblem is.\n\nThe symmetry I did and do support is that the PUT and GET URI for a  \nresource should be the same (otherwise, seems like it is not really a  \nURI?).\n\n&gt; The approach you state below may be specific to your clientele, but  \n&gt; I don&#39;t think that is the general pattern.\n\nWell, all I can tell you is that it seems to work really well for a  \nsystem where documents and their &quot;metadata&quot; are the primary resources.  \nIf it works well for me, it might be useful for others, so I shared.  \nOther people are working with more process oriented systems; in those  \nsituations other solutions may work better.\n\n-- \nChris Dent http://www.burningchrome.com/\nor I&#39;ll remove your commit bit\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
