This is nice, but it comes\nat a cost: your design is more constrained than otherwise, and\nyour organization (developers, management, etc.) may not\nunderstand.  Many distributed applications (most?) turn out to\nbe a heck of a lot *less* distributed than the WWW, not\ntoo surprisingly, and so REST may be overkill.  You can make\ncompromises.\n\nCent#2: If you decide to apply REST principles, you may be\nsurprised to find how relevant a browser becomes to your\ntesting and even your implementation!\n\nRegards,\nWalden\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Mark Baker&quot; &lt;distobj@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;R.
