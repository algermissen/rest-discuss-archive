It&#39;s a question of whether there are problems\n&gt; that require routing where the client specifies the list of nodes in\n&gt; advance and then waits for the completion of hte action. If so, what is\n&gt; the syntax for supporting that.\n\nNote that &quot;client specifies list of nodes [to process intermediate states of\nsome request]&quot; doesn&#39;t imply or require path-based addressing, or indeed any\nURI syntactic solution.  PBA has this insidious problem:  the client\nspecifies A/B/C and hands off to A, counting on A to hand B/C to B, and\ncounting on B to handoff to C, and counting on the reverse.  That is\ndifferent from&quot; &quot;client calls A, gets representation Ra.  Client calls B\nwith representation Ra, getting representation Rb.  Client calls C with\nrepresentation Rb, getting representation Rc.&quot;  It&#39;s not necessary for any\n&quot;intermediary&quot; to know about or interact with any of the others, and if you\nwant a way to declaratively specify or refer to such a sequence of handoffs,\ninvent and XML dialect for it.  (In fact, IIRC, this is what XML Pipes etc.\ndo, more or less.)  Don&#39;t overload URIs with operational semantics.\n\nNote that the first, in addition to the problems already mentioned an in\naddition to introducing new syntax *and* semantics, also means that there\nare now not one but *two* types of HTTP URI addressible resources:  the\ntraditional kind *and* an &quot;addressable proxy&quot; type.  Lots of new complexity,\nand for what purpose?\n\nThere&#39;s nothing you can do with the former that you can&#39;t do with the latter\n--- lots of costs with the former and no clear benefits in the synchronous\ncase.  In the async / Henrik sense, it&#39;s a different story and a different\nargument, but with the same conclusion IMHO.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; If Rohit is not enamored of WS-Routing then I don&#39;t know what he sees in\n&gt; SOAP at all.\n\nI dunno.  A nice envelope?\n\nJb\n\n\n"}}
