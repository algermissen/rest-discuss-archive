It&#39;s marketing.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; My market differentiation as a Web consultant, is my strong knowledge\n&gt; of branding (resulting from my 15-year association with one of the top\n&gt; hired guns in the field, y&#39;all haven&#39;t heard of him but you have heard\n&gt; of &quot;Where&#39;s the beef?&quot; and that silly Taco Bell chihuahua).  I don&#39;t\n&gt; sell websites, I sell online branding.  Apple&#39;s branding has nothing to\n&gt; do with inconveniencing the customer; in fact it&#39;s the polar opposite.\n&gt; So I suspect this isn&#39;t a marketing ploy, because Apple&#39;s too good at,\n&gt; and protective of, its brand identity of user-friendliness uber alles.\n\nEric,\n\nI hate to disagree, but it /has/ to be marketing, if Apple, one of the \nbiggest tech companies in the world, who specialise in sales and \nmarketing, has a store that goes offline before a product launch, then \nit can only be for marketing reasons. Sure a small business would let \nthat be determined by a technical detail, but a multi-billion dollar \ncompany?\n\nIt simply /must/ increase sales over the 24-96 hour period, otherwise \nthey just wouldn&#39;t have it going off line.\n\nSure it&#39;s a sweet story to try and say that Apple are loosing millions \nbecause there system isn&#39;t RESTful, but come on this is the real world a \nmoney hungry company, like they&#39;d accept any geek of any calibre saying \n&quot;uhmm sorry we have to take the apple store offline for X hours every \ntiem you want to add a product&quot; - nahhhhhhhhhhhhh.\n\nBest,\n\nNathan\n\n"}}
