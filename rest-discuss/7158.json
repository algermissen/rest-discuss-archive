He didn&#39;t use HTTP, but I recognize the POST\n&gt; method nonetheless.\n&gt; \n&gt; Had he been required to issue the correct command, I&#39;m\n&gt; sure communication would have broken down.  He knew I\n&gt; would know how best to dispose of the rabbit.  More\n&gt; accurately, and more importantly, he knew no such thing, and\n&gt; yet his POST action was still the right one.\n&gt; \n&gt; Pet lesson in interop #1.\n&gt; \n&gt; Walden\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;Bill de hOra&quot; &lt;bill@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;rest-discuss@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Friday, December 01, 2006 9:21 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [rest-discuss] Atom, &#39;process-this&#39;-POST and rockets\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; : Walden Mathews wrote:\n&gt; : &gt; : Yeah, POST is the protocol equivalent pointing at something and \n&gt; grunting\n&gt; : &gt; : at someone.\n&gt; : &gt;\n&gt; : &gt; Except for the grunting part, yes.
