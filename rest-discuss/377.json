There _do_ exist real security concerns, though\n&gt; they&#39;re not the same as incompetent admins think.\n\nMy point is this:  there are two general strategies for dealing with security\nconsiderations vis-a-vis new technology that has to cross administrative\nboundaries.  The first strategy is to try to anticipate and a priori build for the\nsecurity concerns of the admins by giving them all the &quot;knobs&quot; (controllable\nsecurity features) they think they want and need.  From bitter experience, this\nstrategy is a loser;  even if you give them every knob you think or they claim they\nwant, that still means they have to buy into *actually* twiddling those knobs in\norder for your technology to proliferate.  And they just won&#39;t buy into installing\nand twiddling new knobs, most of the time.  Running a new protocol on a new port is\nan example of giving them a trivial knob that they&#39;ll refuse to twiddle.\n\nThe second strategy is to subvert the existing security infrastructure in such a\nway that only onerous administrative security measures can prevent short-term\nproliferation of your technology.  (Ab)using HTTP is the preferred way to do this;\nthey can&#39;t shut down all Web access, so they have to block specific hosts.  Often\nthis is more trouble than its worth.  The more decentralized your system, the\nbetter off you are;  if they can&#39;t shut down particular hosts, then their filtering\napparatus has to gain explicit knowledge of your application in order to block it.\n\nThe mechanism I&#39;m proposing is really the second, but with some sugar thrown in for\nthe competent admin.  Tunneling HTTP through HTTP allows security vendors to\n*eventually* incrementally modify their intermediary products to filter traffic at\nan application semantic level;  the change is incremental because, after all, it&#39;s\njust HTTP.  However, it&#39;s going to take time for them to develop and deploy that on\nan application by application basis.  Hence the admin function can&#39;t adversely\nimpact the network effects that drive rapid takeoff and proliferation of any given\nnew application.\n\njb\n\n\n\n"}}
