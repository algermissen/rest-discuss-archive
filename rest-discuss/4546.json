Mike Dierken &lt;mdierken@...&gt;  \nwrote:\n\n&gt; By &#39;distributed objects&#39; do you mean an object that has constituent data\n&gt; that is served by multiple hosts, or do you mean a self-contained object\n&gt; that has multiple redundant copies on several hosts?\n\nBoth.\n\n&gt; If a single object is resident on several hosts then the single  \n&gt; identifier needs to access a single host that then in turns communicates  \n&gt; with the\n&gt; disparate constituent servers.\n\nDue to anonymity requirements, the originating node cannot know where all  \nthe pieces of an object are (for example, a query or a transaction), and  \nnodes usually cannot know where the object originated.\n\n&gt; If the several nodes only host redundant copies, then you need a locator\n&gt; algorithm that satisfies your technical requirements. Do you need to  \n&gt; access the same host several times for performance and only switch hosts  \n&gt; for\n&gt; reliability in the face of a host failure?\n\nNo, different hosts each holding their aspect of distributed objects is  \nintegral to the application.\n\n&gt; It sounds like we should talk about what capabilities a single server is\n&gt; providing.\n\nA server hosts multiple nodes that each communicate with many neighbouring  \nnodes (&quot;friends&quot; with which they can exchange IOUs).  Nodes may also  \ncommunicate with a strange node to pay or receive payment from that node.   \nPayments are made by passing IOUs along paths connecting two strange nodes  \nin the network of neighbours.\n\n&gt; You may need a proxy that forwards requests to the current\n&gt; hosting server, or possibly returns a Location header with the &#39;new&#39;\n&gt; location.\n\nSince trust is such an integral issue with this application, there must be  \na mechanism to change any server that proves untrustworthy, including  \nproxy servers.  Changing proxy servers then has all the same  \nidentifier-renaming problems as changing servers.\n\nLike I said, as hard as I&#39;ve tried to make it work, it just seems that  \nREST is inappropriate for the application.  I&#39;m actually looking at  \nbypassing HTTP altogether and using something like Jabber for persistent  \nXML messaging sessions between servers.  Very unRESTful, I know, but it  \nwould be soooo appealingly simple...\n\nRyan\n\n"}}
