IOW: the use provides addressing context.\n\n(1) &#39;we&#39;: Topic Map community, but I think also a substantial portion\n     of knowledge representation communities in general.\n\nSorry again, to raise these issues on this list. While I believe that\nthe \nuse of names (e.g. URIs) in combination with context is the superior\nchoice for knowledge representation, I also understand that a\nknowledge representation system can only be &quot;on the Web&quot; if it uses\na unique addressing context.\n\nI am bringing this up here, because I am looking for the technical\narguments/benefits for a knowledge representation system to be\n&quot;on the Web&quot; as much as possible and, well, I expect to get the\nmost qualified answers on this list.\n\nOne argument I know about is that unique addressing context enables \nintermediaries to &#39;add-in additional information&#39;  because they need\nnot deal with any addressing ambiguity of the URIs they &#39;see&#39;. (Hope\nI recalled that correctly). \n\nAre there other arguments along these lines?\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The distinction can also bee seen this way: In TM-land the author of a\n&gt; &gt; Topic Map\n&gt; &gt; decides in what a given URI identifies, in Web-land the controling\n&gt; &gt; authority\n&gt; &gt; makes this decison.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My particular questions are:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - Is the idea that an authority controls the &#39;meaning of URI&#39; a REST\n&gt; &gt; principle or\n&gt; &gt;   &#39;just&#39; a Web principle?\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d say the latter.  I don&#39;t recall REST talking at all about ownership,\n&gt; though it&#39;s possible some degree of that is implicit in the &quot;meaning\n&gt; via use&quot; aspect of REST.\n\nMark, do you have any pointers regarding this &quot;meaning via use&quot;\naspect of REST?\n\nAnd, uh, to me this sounds like the exact opposite to &quot;meaning\nvia authoritative assignment&quot;...?!?!?\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; - What exactly are the technical advantages of using a unique\n&gt; &gt; addressing context\n&gt; &gt;   when building distributes systems based on REST? Has anybody\n&gt; &gt; analized that\n&gt; &gt;  in detail or can help me with some pointers?\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, independent of REST, the benefit of global naming has been\n&gt; discussed for many many years.  Not that I&#39;m very familiar with the\n&gt; history, but you might look up the work of Engelbart (Augment/NLS), or\n&gt; Nelson (Xanadu).  Sorry I can&#39;t be more specific.  I&#39;m sure somebody\n&gt; here who&#39;s more familiar with hypertext would have a good pointer.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mark.\n\nThanks,\n\nJan\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Mark Baker.
