Fielding & Richard N. Taylor &quot;Principled design of the\nmodern Web architecture,&quot; ACM Trans. Inter. Tech.. ACM Press, vol. 2,\npp. 115-150, 2002.\nTo my understanding, the application refers to the virtual state\nmachine, to an end user it can be a browser or some other agent.\n\nCheers,\n\nDong\n\nOn Jan 16, 2008 8:24 AM, amsmota &lt;amsmota@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m reading the Fielding dissertation and I&#39;m confused about the use\n&gt;  of the word &quot;state&quot; in Representational State Transfer.\n&gt;\n&gt;  This &quot;state&quot; refers to the &quot;resource&quot; of which a representation is\n&gt;  being transfered? Because I only found references to &quot;application\n&gt;  state&quot;, not &quot;resource state&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;  But OTOH I could not find a definition of &quot;application&quot; in the realm\n&gt;  of REST. Should I define it as a &quot;finite, predefined set of resources&quot;\n&gt;  that can be traversed by URI navigation?\n&gt;\n&gt;  Thanks all.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n\n-- \nDong Liu\nhttp://blogs.usask.ca/dong_notes/\n\n"}}
