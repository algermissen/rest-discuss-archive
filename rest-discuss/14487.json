Even for anonymous users, the content changes based on the\nuser&#39;s =\r\nprevious traversal thought the web site.\nSome web sites have content that i=\r\ns region based. For example, for\nwww.xyz.com, different content will be sho=\r\nwn for users from region1\nand region2.\nIt might look bad to have explicit U=\r\nRLs like www.xyz.com/region1,\nwww.xyz.com/region2.\n\nWhat will be the &#39; judi=\r\ncious use of context-setting URI&#39; in this case?\n\nThanks,\nUnmesh\n\n\nOn Sat, J=\r\nan 9, 2010 at 7:18 AM, Eric J.
