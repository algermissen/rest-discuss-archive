This appears to be a good step away from &quot;fine grained&quot; RPC.\n&gt; Some new additions to SOAP 1.2 look like RESTful.\n&gt; \n&gt; Questions are:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Is the new SOAP (1.2) RESTful enough that one can build a REST Web\n&gt; Services?\n\nYes.  SOAP 1.1 was too, though.\n\n&gt; 2. Has anyone actually implemeted a RESTful Web Services? \n\nKnowNow had some demo apps that I saw that were.\nAnd see http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-ws-arch/2002Jul/0301.html\n\nThere was one other one, but I can&#39;t find it.
