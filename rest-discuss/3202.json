People are used to RPC for network-based applications, and SOAP \nprovides exactly that.  That and the fact that you&#39;ve taken something \nthey&#39;re familiar with and sprinkled it with the magic pixie dust that is \nthe web and XML; how can it not be the ultimate application platform? :-/\n\nSeriously, though, I expect that a lot of people just don&#39;t see the \nrelevance of your arguments because they have the wrong mental model.   \n When you&#39;re doing RPC, it isn&#39;t clear that caching RPC messages has \nmuch benefit.\n\n--Chuck\n\n\n"}}
