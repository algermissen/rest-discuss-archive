I&#39;m only now\ncatching up with the last month&#39;s worth of email.\n\nOn Fri, 2006-04-21 at 00:11, Nic wrote:\n&gt; But your earlier arguments were about sessions and session state which\n&gt; I don&#39;t believe is necessary or right. In fact, when building\n&gt; massivly scaled apps it&#39;s very bad because it forces just one\n&gt; implementation strategy (very, very big iron).\n\nHi Nic,\n\nI agree that sessions *can* lead to very, very big iron as the only way\nto scale them, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the only way.\n\nTo me, the State part of REST is just as important as the Representation\npart, as I think Bill pointed out in an earlier response.  With\nmore-or-less static things like a web page, this is easy to scale, but\nyou need to think about how that scalability is accomplished: \nreplication of the thing that will be represented across multiple\nphysical locations.\n\nA web page is a degenerate application example with a few different\nstates with some of the key ones being:  there, gone, not there and\nerror.  I think this is a very important point.\n\nIf a representation is &quot;there&quot;, but the thing that will provide the\nrepresentation can also be in different [application] states, then this\nis where things get fuzzy.  To some people, each of these internal\n&quot;there&quot;/application states represent a different resource.  I think\nthat&#39;s one way, but with dynamic resources, I think it&#39;s important to\nreally think about which is more important, the application state or the\nresource state.  I don&#39;t think that these are necessarily the same\nthing.\n\nThis is why I took the approach I did with RRMTP.  The resource being\nmanipulated represents an instance of an application state machine for\none client (a session, if you will).  As the client manipulates that\nresource, they cause application state transitions within &quot;their&quot;\nresource which will accomplish a business task.  When this task is done,\nthe resource no longer exists.\n\nBack to the scalability issue, you actually do have this sort of issue\nwith web pages as well, it&#39;s just that the cost of replicating the\ncurrent state of the resource to across a server farm is much less\nbecause those resources don&#39;t change often, and if they do change,\npeople may be able to live with stale information for a short period of\ntime until the replication process is complete.\n\nAnother couple of related points to this are based on content\nnegotiation as I understand it and also on trust.  If a URI represents a\nresource with potentially multiple representations based on the needs of\nthe requester, these needs are facilitated when the representation of\nthat resource is created and sent to the client.  A PDF file is very\ndifferent than an HTML file, but both may be views of the same resource\nbased on the needs of the client.  How are those needs expressed to the\nserver?  Through a well-documented mechanism in the HTTP specification: \nthe Accept header.  The state of the URI isn&#39;t PDF vs. HTML, the state\nof the URI is &quot;there&quot; or &quot;not there&quot;, etc.  For the shopping cart, if\nyou can say (hypothetical example):\n\nGET /cart HTTP/1.1\nUser-ID:  12345\n\nand that actually results in you being redirected to /cart/x12345 which\nshows &quot;your&quot; current cart, then that would be perfectly ok, I think. \nWhile you&#39;re shopping, you continue to use /cart/x12345, and if you try\nnot to use /cart/x12345, you may either get sent there based on some\nshared context, or you may get a new cart.  This is not wildly different\nthan GET /image =&gt; /image.png vs. /image.gif vs. image.jpg, it is just\nthat the scope of the valid context is smaller.\n\nAlso, in a long conversation and interaction with a resource moving\nthrough application states, the client may end up with a lot of context\nit needs to send with each request.  This to me is just as opaque as\nsession state on the server when looking at sharing URIs via email.  In\nthis respect, I see URIs as just keys in a massively huge hashtable.\n\nOne final point, and I know this has gotten longer than I intended, in\nmaintaining all of the context in the exchange between the client and\nthe server on the client, you have a massive trust dependency on the\ninformation you get from the client not being changed between their\nbrowser and your server.  Of course, you can solve this with HTTPS, but\nshould browsing and putting items in a cart actually require HTTPS to\nestablish that trust?  I don&#39;t think they necessarily should.  Checking\nout would require strong authentication, but putting items in the cart\nwouldn&#39;t necessarily.\n\nMaybe this doesn&#39;t make sense.  I&#39;m still trying to figure out all this\nstuff too.\n\nast\n-- \nJoin me in Dubrovnik, Croatia on May 8-10th when I will be speaking at\nInfoSeCon 2006.
