To this point, I have concentrated on supporting the Accept\nheader as a way to allow clients to inform the server on what media\ntype to use for the representation on a GET request. This all seems\nfine.\n\nNow I am wondering how important (or common) it is to provide multiple\nmedia type support for POST and PUT. I would assume Content-Type would\nbe used by the client to communicate this info. I would also assume\nthat servers could respond with Status 415 if the Content-Type was not\nsupported for the POST or PUT.\n\nAny guidance or pointers to references on this topic are appreciated.\n\nMike A\n\n\n-- \nmca\n&quot;In a time of universal deceit, telling the truth becomes a\nrevolutionary act. &quot; (George Orwell)\n\n"}}
