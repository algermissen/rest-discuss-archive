During a deepwreck dive, I think I achieved Zen on\n&gt; &gt; REST and methods.\n&gt;\n&gt; And I thought *I* was obsessed.\n\nI&#39;m not finished catching up, so pardon me if I take anyone off their thread.\nDuring my dive, I realized that in order for me to see the fish around the\nwreck, and swim across the ship&#39;s deck to a payphone and act like I&#39;m placing a\ncall, I must go to the site first.  I can&#39;t do any of it from the boat.  I swim\nto the mooring buoy and descend down the line to the wreck....i.e., I transfer\nmyself.\n\nI probably went over the top with my analogy.  But what it helped me realize is\nthat when you boiled it down, my notion of method - and even my revised notion\n(after our noun vs. verb discussion) - was *yet* another RPC!  Makes me cringe\n;-).  Bottom line: to break away from an RPC over the Internet, why not just\ntake &#39;remote&#39; out of RPC and replace it with &#39;local&#39;?  And how do you do that in\nREST?\n\nYou GET a representation of the resource, invoke your method locally, and then\nPOST the updated representation back to the resource.  That&#39;s it.  Wasn&#39;t it Tip\nO&#39;Neill that said &quot;all politics is local&quot;?  You get the idea...\n\n-Philip\n\n\n\n"}}
