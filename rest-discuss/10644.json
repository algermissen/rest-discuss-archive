Firstly it seems to ha=\r\nve a uniform\ninterface. Furthermore, as I go through &#39;music-&gt;artists-&gt;elvis=\r\n&#39;, etc\n... I am navigating links. This is &quot;connectedness&quot; as described in\nR=\r\nESTful Web Services. Actually, I would like to see more from the Pod\nin thi=\r\ns direction - for example, for the song I am currently listening\nto, it wou=\r\nld be nice to see how this is linked into which playlist,\ngenre, etc. This =\r\nwould be going in the linked data direction.\nFurthermore, I believe I see a=\r\n very nice example of the mysterious\nhypermedia as the engine of applicatio=\r\nn state, in, for example, the\nstopwatch function of the ipod.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
