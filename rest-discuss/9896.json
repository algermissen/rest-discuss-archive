It&#39;s the\n&gt;&gt; cookie (to be used only in the XHR &#39;personalizing&quot; request) that handles\n&gt;&gt; identity (and NOT as part of the page request).  Requesting the page URI\n&gt;&gt; returns the exact same resource no matter who the user is (and thus it&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; cacheable).  It&#39;s the CLIENT that &quot;decides&quot; if it wants to take the next\n&gt;&gt; step and personalize the page by firing an XHR.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; There&#39;s a fuzzy issue here of just what exactly constitutes a resource.\n&gt; There&#39;s a line beyond which sufficient client personalization has\n&gt; created a new resource, and such a resource should have its own URL.\n&gt;\n\nBut I&#39;d suggest that it&#39;s a resource that the server need not know \nanything about.  For one thing, it won&#39;t be of any use to anyone but this \nparticular user.  Sort of like if I print out the web page -- that piece \nof paper is a new resource, but it need not have a URI since (aside from \nbeing a physical object, and not network-addressable) it only matters to \nme here & now.\n\nI&#39;m trying to figure out where that outer edge of REST is.  Where does it \nstop being about a state that needs any further respresentations \ntransferred....\n\n--Peter\n\n&gt; Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\n&gt; Java I/O 2nd Edition Just Published!\n&gt; http://www.cafeaulait.org/books/javaio2/\n&gt; http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596527500/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA/\n&gt;\n\n"}}
