The\nimportance of media ty=\r\npes (data!) is evidence of this vital aspect of\nimplementing distributed sy=\r\nstems.\n\nMany developers I encounter continue to focus primarily on the\ncomp=\r\nonents of the system rather than the data passed between them. It\nis unders=\r\ntandable since most education, software tooling, and\nvaluation within the d=\r\neveloper community continues to place components\nabove the data these compo=\r\nnents process.\n\n[1] http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/soft=\r\nware_arch.htm#sec_1_2_3\n\nmca\nhttp://amundsen.com/blog/\nhttp://twitter.com@m=\r\namund\nhttp://mamund.com/foaf.rdf#me\n\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Dec 21, 2011 at 08:13, Thom=\r\nas Koch &lt;thomas@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; one may wonder, why so many devel=\r\nopers don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; REST and do countless RPC-\n&gt; over-HTTP APIs and what coul=\r\nd be done to advance REST.\n&gt; I&#39;ve one idea. First my assumption:\n&gt; People d=\r\non&#39;t get REST, because one of the main ideas is that you need common\n&gt; stan=\r\ndard media types for REST. But people don&#39;t know about media types.\n&gt; I&#39;ve =\r\ndone web sites for 6 years but only now, while doing research for my\n&gt; bach=\r\nelor thesis, I discovered how many great media types are there and could\n&gt; =\r\nbe reused.\n&gt;\n&gt; And there is no advertisement for good media types.
