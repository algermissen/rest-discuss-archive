I have to admit that i don&#39;t really understand.\n&gt; &gt; You have to define a format that is suitable for any kind of\n&gt; &gt; application. This look quite ambitious. You can use RDF to help the\n&gt; &gt; representation to be self descriptive, but you still have to define (ou\n&gt; &gt; refine) and RDFS. From an other pov, your proposal looks like wsdl (as\n&gt; &gt; Bill? said).\n&gt; \n&gt; See my comments on taking HTTP seriously in the other thread.\n&gt; Earlier, you defined an inbox index format.  I am saying that is enough to \n&gt; define your entire application from the client&#39;s perspective.\n&gt; \n&gt; If the server returns an index in response to a GET without an Accept \n&gt; header, the resource is an index and NOT a container.  That means the \n&gt; semantics of POST  should be with respect to that index and not a \n&gt; container.  In other words, if the resource IS an index, then POST means \n&gt; add an entry to the index and NOT add a message to a container; messages \n&gt; must be stored somewhere else a la DJ Bernstein.\n&gt; \n&gt; If the server returns a container in response to a GET without an Accept \n&gt; header, the resource is a container and not an index.  That means the \n&gt; semantics of POST should be with respect to the container and not an index. \n&gt; In other words, if the resource is a container, then POST means add a \n&gt; message to the container and can at your option affect an index.  Messages \n&gt; are stored in the container  a la SMTP.  Note, nothing constrains the \n&gt; server from providing an index in response to a GET with a an &quot;Accept: \n&gt; text/x-yannick-index&quot;, but that is really beside the point.\n\n\n\n"}}
