I&#39;m sure\n&gt; that if the model is sound and has real benefits over PROPFIND,\n&gt; Apache/moddav would adopt really fast...\n\nOkay, thanks. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll have time for it.\n\n&gt; &gt; One could imagine combining the proposal with an idea unifying WebDAV\n&gt; &gt; properties with the RDF model.\n&gt; \n&gt; Interesting. Could you elaborate?\n\nTruthfully, not really. I haven&#39;t thought it through yet. Basically it\nwould be cool if you could use all RDF tools on WebDAV properties. Maybe\nyou can do that now by just using RDF in properties.\n-- \n&quot;When I walk on the floor for the final execution, I&#39;ll wear a denim \nsuit.
