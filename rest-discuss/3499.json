I&#39;m not so sure\nthat the second part should be &quot;standardized&quot;.  As you point out, there are\nmany different ways that the &quot;mailbox&quot; may be used by the recipient(s).\nDifferent people are going to have different needs.  As a result, client\ninterfaces are going to vary.  It might be good to define a one or two\n&quot;common&quot; interfaces to allow implementation-independent tools to be used.\nHowever, I do not think it a good idea to discourage additional interfaces.\nOtherwise, it feels like the square-peg-in-round-hole syndrome that has made\na mess of so many other web specifications as of late (imho).\n\nBut I don&#39;t want to get ahead of myself here.  It does look like we have a\ncouple people interested (and I hope that more will join).  As a result, I\nhave started a new mailing list (rest-messaging@yahoogroups.com).  Please\nfeel free to join and contribute.  :)\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\nFrom: &quot;S. Alexander Jacobson&quot; &lt;alex@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I am interested in this as well, but, as we\n&gt; discussed earlier, it faces the difficulty of\n&gt; retrieving only &quot;new&quot; messages.\n&gt;\n&gt; Assuming, we follow Roy Fielding&#39;s reccomdendation\n&gt; and view a mailbox as a container for\n&gt; messages/notifications, we need a way to query for\n&gt; all messages since the last time the client\n&gt; checked.\n&gt;\n&gt; Here are some approaches and their issues:\n&gt; 1. Modify the server&#39;s state each time the client\n&gt; checks for messages, but that prevents multiple\n&gt; clients from sharing the same mailbox without\n&gt; proliferating server state and it also prevents\n&gt; the same user from going back to a prior state\n&gt; without substantial added complexity.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. Use a parametrized URL, like:\n&gt;\n&gt;   GET /getNewNotifications?since=UID\n&gt;\n&gt; where UID is the unique identifier of the last\n&gt; message retrieved, but this seems unRESTful in\n&gt; that this URL is not really opaque (In the\n&gt; Wiki Jeff Bone appears to argue that this is ok,\n&gt; so I am not really sure, but to me it feels\n&gt; unRESTful)\n&gt;\n&gt; 3. Use a single range headers against a single\n&gt; mailbox URL, but that prohibits you from changing\n&gt; the representation of the underlying mailbox.  If\n&gt; we want the server periodically to check\n&gt; availability of actual messages and update on that\n&gt; basis, we can&#39;t use range headers.\n&gt;\n&gt; 4. Use multipart-byteranges.\n&gt; I think this is the best option, but a. most\n&gt; clients don&#39;t suppport it and b. it verges on\n&gt; specification abuse.\n&gt;\n&gt; A much more useful way to go would be for the HTTP\n&gt; authors not to have used bytes as the only units\n&gt; for range headers.  If HTTP allowed range headers\n&gt; to be specified in application units e.g. records,\n&gt; then this would all be very easy.  Unfortunately,\n&gt; they didn&#39;t and we have HTTP as it currently\n&gt; stands.\n\n\n"}}
