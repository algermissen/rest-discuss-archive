But just\n&gt;&gt; saying &#39;use prose&#39; does not address 3. above. This was one of the\n&gt;&gt; points made by Steve Jones: given that WS-* has a rigid interface\n&gt;&gt; description language &#39;built in&#39; while the use of REST means you have\n&gt;&gt; to come up with a means of describing interfaces yourself is a huge\n&gt;&gt; selling point for WS-*. Not that having such things as WSDL and BPEL\n&gt;&gt; is desireable from a networked systems point of view but when a non\n&gt;&gt; technical person has to make a business decision about WS-* vs REST,\n&gt;&gt; the latter is more likely to &#39;loose&#39; if you first have to come up\n&gt;&gt; with a style for documenting the interfaces. And even worse would be\n&gt;&gt; the position of &#39;Nah, you don&#39;t need that. Just let everyone write\n&gt;&gt; it up&#39;.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Sorry, but I think it is a flawed assertion to say that &quot;WS-* has a\n&gt; rigid interface description language &#39;built in&#39;&quot; which somehow makes\n&gt; it better.\n\nDon&#39;t get me wrong: I am not saying that it is better. I am just  \nsaying that the WSDL serves a (perceived) need of the people in charge  \nof assigning people like us the budget.\n\nAnd I am saying that it is very easy to actually build more coupling  \ninto prose definitions of REST services than is necessary.\n\n\nJan\n\n\n\n\n&gt; Just because it has been sold like that does not make it\n&gt; true. I would love to see a developer who wrote a client application\n&gt; by just looking at the WSDL, or a business person who was not asked  a\n&gt; single clarification about some operation or a field is supposed to\n&gt; work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Subbu\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
