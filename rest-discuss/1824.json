I didn&#39;t know that.  ...figured that the interactions with the\n&gt; server would be too intimate to make the client-side protocol generic.\nJust take a look at the script that comes down from a KN page - essentially\nthere is a hidden frame that receives the streaming response from the\nserver. The response is set of &lt;form id=&quot;msg_id&quot;&gt; elements - which are DOM\naccessible in all browsers - followed by a &lt;script&gt; tag which calls a parent\nframe callback with the msg_id - the DOM node gets passed essentially.\nBrowsers parse the &lt;form&gt; and interpret the &lt;script&gt; in a streaming\nfashion - so things happen right away. Simplicity itself. The only tricky\nparts are the cross-frame and cross-window (and cross-domain) scripting.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yeah... I&#39;d rather see the connection opened by the client & the roles\n&gt; &gt; reversed via a magic command - how about a new HTTP method of &#39;LISTEN&#39;?\n&gt;\n&gt; Not sure it&#39;s necessary!  I think that you can use the Upgrade header --\n&gt; http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.42\n&gt;\n&gt; &#39; The Upgrade header field is intended to provide a simple mechanism for\n&gt; transition from HTTP/1.1 to some other, incompatible protocol. It does so\n&gt; by allowing the client to advertise its desire to use another protocol,\n&gt; such as a later version of HTTP with a higher major version number, even\n&gt; though the current request has been made using HTTP/1.1. This eases the\n&gt; difficult transition between incompatible protocols by allowing the\n&gt; client to initiate a request in the more commonly supported protocol\n&gt; while indicating to the server that it would like to use a &quot;better&quot;\n&gt; protocol if available (where &quot;better&quot; is determined by the server,\n&gt; possibly according to the nature of the method and/or resource being\n&gt; requested). &#39;\n&gt;\n&gt; (major caveat emptor on everything I have to say here: the only actual\n&gt; code I have is a bunch of munged Tomcat source.)\n&gt;\nI&#39;m thinking that taking mod_jserv (or whatever the mod it that talks the\napjserv protocol between apache & tomcat) and changing it to look for the\nnew method or &#39;upgrade&#39; header and responding with OK and then forwarding\nany further requests down the jserv connection - which what the mod_jserv\nalready does! The jserv startup would need configuration for what host & url\nto &#39;attach/mount&#39; and then do the http request with the method or header.\nAll the existing security (including the &#39;upgrade&#39; request) would take place\nin the hosted Apache server outside the firewall.\n\nOh, for some spare time...\n\n\n"}}
