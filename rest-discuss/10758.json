What is the difference between this, and say, packaging\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; the\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; same parts as some XML elements inside some envelope element?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Several benefits:\n&gt;  &gt; - Multipart messages are a standard way to represent compound payloads\n&gt;  &gt; - You don&#39;t enforce the use of xml\n&gt;\n&gt;  I don&#39;t disagree. But today&#39;s infrastructure does not deal with POST,\n&gt;  PUT etc packaged inside multipart messages. For instance, a cache\n&gt;  can&#39;t mark an entry in the cache stale when a PUT is submitted via a\n&gt;  multipart message. Yes, there are theoretical benefits, but it is\n&gt;  difficult to realize those benefits in reality.\n&gt;\n&gt;  The basic motivation for proposals like this is to let a client submit\n&gt;  a bunch of requests and get them executed in at once. The supposed\n&gt;  benefit for the client is that it does not have to make &quot;n&quot; number of\n&gt;  requests. However, IMO, once we get into the details, the picture\n&gt;  won&#39;t be as simple as this. For instance, what is the cost for the\n&gt;  client to recover from partial failures? What is cost for the client\n&gt;  and server to use two different code paths - one for regular requests\n&gt;  and another for batch requests? Does the client sufficiently\n&gt;  understand the difference between non-idempotent requests and\n&gt;  idempotent requests bundled in the same batch? For the simple cases,\n&gt;  yes, the answers may be simple, but IMO, the complexity of batch may\n&gt;  outweigh the benefits.\n\n1. There is some bulk operation in WebDAV, which then requires the\nnotion of partial failure to come back in the response; a simple\nsingle error code is no longer enough\n\n2. WS-ResourceFramework, while near the pinnacle of WS-*, tried to\nretrofit bulk operations to its resource-model-atop-SOAP world view,\nand again, got into a mess about atomicity of updates as well as\nfailures. What I dont like about it (apart from it being the pinnacle\nof WS-*) is that there was no per-resource metadata about the\natomicity, and no guarantee that all servers worked the same.\n\nthe nice thing about doing bulk operations as a sequence of requests\nis that you can be sure that\n -the bulk operation is not atomic\n -if one operation fails, everything you havent yet pushed out wont\nhave gone through\n -state changes are observable to others during the sequence of operations.\n -the single update code path==the bulk update code path\nIt may not be the exact behaviour you want, but at least you can be\nsure that it will be consistent, that no server updates will suddenly\nchange their behaviour without you noticing. Which is good, as it is\nsurprisingly hard to write tests to determine exactly what the bulk\nupdate semantics of a remote system are.\n\n-steve\n\n"}}
