I know. And you wrote the specs. It&#39;s certainly difficult arguing\nwith you because of that. But hey! I&#39;m cantankerous!\n\n\nI have written clients and servers as well (though I&#39;m sure not as\nmany as you) but I&#39;ve never felt that content negotiation was onerous.\n\n\n&gt; If the server assumes that every content type is a variant of\n&gt; a single resource instead of a representation, then clients are\n&gt; unable to replace an HTML representation with an XML representation.\n\nHow so? text/html and text/xml (or application/xml or\napplication/xml+rss or whatever).\n\nI agree that it&#39;s not possible to replace one text/xml with another\ntext/xml even though they might be different representations (eg: src\ndocument and fo). I can honestly say I&#39;ve never run into that\nparticular problem. Mostly I find that one (maybe 2) authorial formats\nare used within a particular system.\n\n\n&gt; In order for the client to present an accurate user interface\n&gt; for authoring a negotiated resource, it would have to know all of\n&gt; the potential media types that might be representations for a given\n&gt; resource. Not just the ones that are valid now, but all of those\n&gt; that might ever be valid.\n\nI certainly wasn&#39;t suggesting that. \n\nWhile I was making that suggestion I was imagining a large CMS with\nmany authors. Something on the scale of wikipedia (but that&#39;s not\nunique at all, I&#39;ve worked on similar sized things for clients).\n\nIn such a system using a PUT system with content negotiation might be\nuseful. People have different editors that produce different content\ntypes and a content-neg system could ease the use of that.\n\nMaybe I could write an article on honey bees (which are a current\ninterest of mine) in HTML and PUT it to /cms/apismellifera.\n\nA collegue might spot some mistakes and opens the resource in Word. He\nchanges the mistakes, saves a local copy (in .doc) and PUTs the\nresource back to the server under the same URL: /cms/apismellifera.\n\nThe server doesn&#39;t accept Word DOC format so it sends a 406 and my\ncolleague tells Word to save it as HTML this time. Then it works.\n\nWeeks later we upgrade the CMS so that it accepts Word DOC format as a\nrepresentation for resources and my colleague goes through exactly the\nsame process as before with another mistake. This time he can PUT the\ndocument in Word DOC format.\n\n\nIn the meantime whenever someone GETs the resource /cms/apismellifera\nthey do the same content neg. Mostly people with browsers do\ntext/html, text/xml, *.*. People with other editors might highly\nprioritize native formats which the server would deliver if it had\nthem or could generate them.\n\n\n&gt; That way, the client gets informed of the URIs for the other\n&gt; specific resources that it might need to author or delete.\n\nAh. I think I see what you&#39;re getting at.\n\nI have been making a presumption based on my personal practice. My\npersonal practice is to not allow a representation unless it can be\narrived at by conversion from another representation.\n\nIn the system I describe above it would have to be a decision for the\nCMS administrators whether to allow representations that would result\nin lossy conversions to the other representations to be added.\n\n\nGiven representations with no conversion I do see what you&#39;re getting\nat.\n\nAnd clearly being able to convert is not a requirement of the specs.\n\n\n&gt;&gt; Of course, I&#39;d be pretty annoyed if I&#39;d just typed war and peace into\n&gt;&gt; a text box and the server said that.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d be pretty annoyed by the text box. ;-)  HTML forms are not a\n&gt; good editing environment and HTTP certainly isn&#39;t limited to them.\n&gt; MS Word writes directly to web folders which is just another\n&gt; HTTP client library (with bugs).\n\nYeah. I knew that. I was just trying to be funny.\n\nAnd it&#39;s not that funny either because still with all these tools how\ndo we update the wikipedia page on Apis Mellifera?\n\n\n\nNic\n\n"}}
