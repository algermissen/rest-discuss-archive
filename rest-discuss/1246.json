The hypertext instance is an instance of a\n&gt; document type defined by a schema.\nBy &#39;instance based&#39; I meant &#39;instance of a resource&#39;. You can&#39;t get the URI\nto a resource before the resource exists. Actually, you can, if the server\ndecides the URI. In the case of PUT, the client decides the URI - but that\nmight be problematic in general. The client could use POST to request that a\nnew resource be created and the server can report what that server-generated\nURI is - I suppose that would solve that problem.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not 100% sure if this addresses the gist of your concern because I\n&gt; don&#39;t see how pattern-based identifiers would help. The question is\n&gt; whether you have the information you need available at design time or\n&gt; not. With pattern-based systems you presumably have some regular\n&gt; expression language or something. With XML you have schemas.\nThe pattern could be XML or something. Doesn&#39;t have to a &#39;grep&#39; like\nlanguage.\n\n\n\n"}}
