Ofcourse, having a code\nthat matches with your resources is probably much simpler and we don&#39;t\nwant to make the systems any harder than they are. But when you are\ntalking about REST, what code is present in the server doesn&#39;t really\nmatter.\n\nI guess I might be confused by what you mean by server side classes -\nobviously the code that actually handles the request will be very\ndifferent for WS-* and REST, but if both want to achieve the same\nthing (say mailing a book) then why can&#39;t both have the same code\nunderneath ?\n\nAlan said :\n&gt; I didn&#39;t want to bog down into implementation details, to be honest. I\n&gt; will be talking about the importance of media-types and the use of\n&gt; Accept* for conneg, but not as a Fallacy / Fact thing - just\n&gt; commentary.\n&gt;\n\nActually , we should all just ping Roy and ask him to just write down\nhis famed chapter on media types. ( that he couldn&#39;t write because of\nthe hard deadline of his thesis)... maybe a new thread on rest-discuss\nis warranted?\n\n\n&gt; I have to admit that I have always found POST slightly annoying. I\n&gt; understand why it fulfills the catch-all MISCELLANEOUS role but it\n&gt; provides a refuge for scoundrels too often (imho). How can you have\n&gt; &#39;universal semantics&#39; for a method that is semantically meaningless by\n&gt; definition?\n\nYou should read and point people towards Roy&#39;s post on rest-discuss -\n&quot;Rest is not file storage&quot; deploring how everyone looks down upon\nPOST. I think this is important cos most of the REST decks/articles on\nthe net really do look down upon POST and Roy&#39;s POST levels the field\na bit. (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/10740). It\nmight also help people relate to REST as an interface model (when he\ntalks about UI) .\n\nRegards\nDevdatta\n\n"}}
