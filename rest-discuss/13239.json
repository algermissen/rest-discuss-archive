If\n&gt; anyone has anything I =\r\nwould be interested. I started writing some\n&gt; thoughts at the link below, a=\r\ns a first pass based on some recent\n&gt; experiences.\n&gt;\n&gt; http://blog.technolo=\r\ngyofcontent.com/2009/08/the-resource-oriented-enterprise/\n&gt;\n&gt; thanks\n&gt;\n&gt; Ju=\r\nstin\n&gt;\n\nTracking SOA along a technical pathway gleans an interesting differ=\r\nence.  The business advantage of ROA can be likened to other information sy=\r\nstems that thrive due to transparency.\n\nSOA services should be used to mode=\r\nl service-to-service interactions (read: opaque services interacting).  For=\r\n example, ship this package for me to her.  The package only needs to be in=\r\nspect-able up to the point that the service is responsible.  In this exampl=\r\ne, the shipper needs only provide the shipping service transparency into th=\r\ne weight, addressing, legality of the contents (stretch case area), yada ya=\r\nda.\n\nWithin the services that spawned SOA, most interactions were one-way m=\r\nessages.  The SLA is simple.  The service provider must acknowledge (or non=\r\n-acknowledge) receipt (ownership of delivery).  The service provider should=\r\n also provide a means for the shipper to receive (or check up on (poll)) th=\r\ne final acknowledgement (or any non-acknowledgement along the path).  Every=\r\n service within the chain follows the SLA (or the calling service compensat=\r\nes to ensure they meet their SLA).\n\nThe shipping example can provide good i=\r\nnsight into where ROA would have provided the optimal transparency from the=\r\n start.  (And conversely where SOA opaqueness leads to much re-negotiation.=\r\n)\n\nAfter the shipper ships the package, they get antsy, they want to track =\r\nstatus all along the shipment path.  A reply of &quot;That&#39;s not our SLA!&quot; is no=\r\nt very service-oriented (albeit technically correct).\n\nWithin SOA, the SLA =\r\nis re-negotiated and all services within the chain go through this same re-=\r\nnegotiation.  The services introduce storing of acknowledgments.  And a sto=\r\nrage invalidation scheme is introduced (wouldn&#39;t want to keep acknowledgmen=\r\nts that no one will ask for).  As a sidenote (from the SOA perspective), ea=\r\nch service models the acknowledgment for transmission up chain(s) as well a=\r\ns down chain(s) and for storage.\n\nThe storing and representation of acknowl=\r\nedgments pretty well models the world without computers shipping scenario. =\r\n That is how information flowed.  And it is also very resource oriented.  I=\r\nt is how a ROA service would be designed from the start.\n\nWe must think bot=\r\nh in terms of resources and services.  We are here to fulfill our clients&#39; =\r\nexpectations (read: get paid).  And we are here to be well served.\n\nROA ser=\r\nvices model requester -&gt; resource action(s) including potentially triggered=\r\n actions.  The modeling actions within ROA is HATEOS.  Through a reduction =\r\nof verbs and a plethora of resources, the modeling of actions is transparen=\r\nt to consumers of the service as well as the implementers of the service.\n\n=\r\nContract negotiation, being a necessary evil, cannot be avoided.  ROA servi=\r\nces are generally modeled and can be propped up (or mocked) quickly.  By fo=\r\ncusing on the resources, risk can be reduced by constructing the &quot;edge case=\r\ns&quot; resources.  This can be done in SOA, but most SOA developers do not unde=\r\nrstand their tools to that level or do not understand that in the end they =\r\nare constructing a resource.\n\n\n"}}
