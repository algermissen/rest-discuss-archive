The client in this context isn&#39;t a web\n&gt; browser but instead a java application. One argument in favor of\n&gt; SOAP is that the java toolkits, client and server, are pretty\n&gt; good, while with RESTful HTTP, the server toolkits are pretty\n&gt; good while clients aren&#39;t so much.\n&gt; \n&gt; Do y&#39;all buy this argument? Can anyone recommend a very good HTTP\n&gt; client for RESTful application development in java?\n\nAsking for a toolkit suggests that you need/want several individual\ntools.  You might want to begin by specifying the need for each\ntool.  Let me give it a start:\n\n1. Negotiate with the host/server -- Specify the headers. Specify\n  the verb (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Make the HTTP request.  Get\n  the response, the response code, the content.\n\n2. Parse and process the content delivered by the server (i.e. the\n  REST application) -- If the content is XML, this means using an\n  XML parser and possibly translating the XML content into\n  instances of classes in the native programming language.\n\n3. Generate the content to be uploaded to the server (e.g. the\n  content for POST requests) -- For example, if the information to\n  be uploaded is contained in instances of classes in the\n  programming language, then translate (export) these instances to\n  XML or &quot;extract&quot; XML from them.\n\n4. In some cases the client application will need to communicate\n  with warm fingers and eyeballs -- Create a GUI to show content to\n  the user, to accept input from the user, etc. A GUI toolkit, a\n  form designer, etc would be helpful here.\n\nThe up-side of SOAP is that it does #1, #2, and #3 above for you. \nThe down-side is (1) a severe restriction in flexibility and (2) a\nlarge amount of specification creep and complexity growth.\nAlthough, given enough companies producing enough specs (and\ncomplexity), they may fix the restrictions.\n\nFor me, working in Python, negotiating with the host (#1 above) is\npretty easy, since there is a standard module (httplib) to help me. \nI&#39;m guessing that Java has equivalent classes.  (Actually, a\nsubsequent follow-up argued that Java&#39;s support in this area is\nweak.  I can&#39;t believe that.)\n\nAlso, parsing the content and generating content (#2 and #3) are\nrelatively easy, because I have an XML toolkit (PyXML) and I also\nhave a tool that I&#39;ve written myself that turns XML Schema document\ndefinitions into classes that can parse and represent an XML\ndocument.  If you think this is what you need, you might want to\nread about it and what it does, even though it is Python specific. \nInformation is at:\n\n    http://www.rexx.com/~dkuhlman/#generateDS\n    http://www.rexx.com/~dkuhlman/generateDS.html\n        \nAnd, I&#39;m still thinking about the GUI stuff.\n\nWhat other needs does a client and a client developer have? I&#39;m\nhoping that others will add ideas to this list of needs and tools\nfor client-side REST.  After all, recognizing and specifying out\nneeds is the first step toward filling them.  Or, as a psychiatrist\nwould tell you, admitting that you are ill is the first step toward\nrecovery (and paying the psychiatrist, of course).\n\n  - Dave\n\n-- \nDave Kuhlman\ndkuhlman@...\nhttp://www.rexx.com/~dkuhlman\n\n"}}
