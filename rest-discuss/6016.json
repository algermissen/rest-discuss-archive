Ideally, the &#39;object&#39; is the &#39;resource&#39;, \ni.e. the &#39;object&#39; is described by the URI.\n\nThis function only applies to requests which are going to result in 200 \nclass responses. (i.e. requests which do not cause side-effects and \nwhich do return attached entities). If the URI is not sufficiently \nexplicit, then HTTP header semantics can be applied. Notionally, these \nheaders can be applied to infer the explicit object and a response can \nbe generated, however I think it&#39;s better to redirect to the explicit \nURI. This helps separate concerns.\n\nSo, acceptable_representation_types is irrelevant. An *explicit* \ndescription of the &#39;object&#39; will nominate the *specific* representation \nformat. (Most suitably with something like .html, .xhtml, .pdf, etc.)\n\nThere are universal semantics associated with HTTP headers, and I&#39;m not \nsuggesting you shouldn&#39;t use them. However, I suggest that if you do use \nthem, then you use them to redirect to different URIs.\n\nThere are three things that can happen:\n\n  (1) You receive an &#39;inexplicit resource description&#39; and need to \nredirect to an &#39;explicit resource description&#39; based on HTTP header content.\n\n  (2) You receive an &#39;explicit resource description&#39; which is \nincompatible with HTTP header content, so you need to redirect to a \nmodified &#39;explicit resource description&#39;.\n\n  (3) You receive an &#39;explicit resource description&#39; which is compatible \nwith HTTP header content, so you process the request and return a \nrepresentation. (Assuming you don&#39;t need to redirect or notify of an \nerror based on what you know about &#39;subject&#39;, &#39;object&#39;, &#39;time&#39;, and \n&#39;server state&#39; while processing).\n\n&gt; What is &#39;object&#39; by the way? presuming that &#39;subject&#39; is the uri?\n\nThe &#39;object&#39; is the explicit description of the resource (i.e. the URI). \nThe &#39;subject&#39; is the additional context which does not exist in the URI. \nThe &#39;best&#39; subject transparently supported by HTTP is the HTTP Auth header.\n\nIdeally, in my view, all properties of the &#39;subject&#39; would be implied by \na single thing called the &#39;session token&#39;. The server would know about \nthe state of the subject&#39;s properties by dereferencing the session token \nduring processing (at the point where it can &#39;stop time&#39;, if necessary).\n\nHTTP can&#39;t support this in any transparent or universal way, although \ncookies get you most of the way there.\n\nWhat I&#39;m really concerned about though (and I want to keep stressing \nthis) is that people have their &#39;sense of value&#39; out of proportion. Some \npeople think that &#39;HTTP&#39; is 80% what makes the web work, and &#39;URI&#39; the \nother 20%. Whereas I think it&#39;s more like URI=95% and HTTP=5%.\n\nAs has been noted, the &#39;universal&#39; nature of HTTP is poorly implemented. \nPeople interpreting the &#39;universal semantics&#39; of HTTP headers deviate \nfrom each other. That&#39;s bad. It&#39;s not so bad at the moment that the web \ndoesn&#39;t work. But it might become bad.\n\nThe place for request semantics is in the URI. Not all context can be \nencapsulated in the URI however. To the extent that additional context \nis required a notion of &#39;subject&#39; covers the requirement. &#39;Subject&#39; can \nbe a &#39;session token&#39;.\n\nIf this isn&#39;t acknowledged then people are going to start putting \n&#39;subject&#39; context in a custom header, or otherwise misappropriating HTTP \nheaders. That will be worse than using cookies. People need sessions. \nSessions make for better resource descriptions in URLs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
