The values in the set may be resource\nrepresentations and/or resource identifiers.\n\nThis leads me to a conclusion I don&#39;t like: Two resources that are\nowl:sameAs must respond to the same requests at the same time with the\nsame representations, because the resource *is* the membership\nfunction.\n\nSomething smells wrong to me.\n\nRoy says that &quot;a non-virtual object (e.g. a person)&quot; can be a\nresource. How is a person a membership function? I tried to\nrationalize this by saying that the words &quot;entity&quot; and &quot;value&quot; in the\ndefinition referred to the person to which the membership function\nmapped, but the very next sentence of the definition limits the values\nto &quot;representations and/or identifiers&quot;.\n\nWhat am I missing?\n\n\n"}}
