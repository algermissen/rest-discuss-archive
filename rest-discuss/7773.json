The answer is clearly &quot;no&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, when we consider the other rule about &quot;If the request would,\n&gt; without the If-Match header field, result in anything other than a 2xx\n&gt; or 412 status, then the If-Match header MUST be ignored.&quot; this means\n&gt; that if the request is GET we will get a 404, but with PUT we will get a\n&gt; 412 (I&#39;m simplifying my assuming that there are no other factors\n&gt; affecting the status code returned).\n\nIf I understand your contention correctly, you are saying that:\n\nIf the resource is missing;\n   and any value at all is specified in If-Match\n      then return 412 Precondition Failed\n\nI can see the logic of how you reached that conclusion, but I am left\nwondering &quot;if that is the case, why does the spec bother to stipulate\nthe case of the wildcard - why not stipulate &#39;any&#39; instead?&quot;\n\nHmmmmm.....\n\nAlan\n\n"}}
