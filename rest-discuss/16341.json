Look=\r\ning to resolve my confusions and it&#39;s not getting anywhere. User error?! :)=\r\n\n\nNo :-)\n\nI think it will be helpful to go backwards in the archives and re=\r\nad your way through from 2002 to about 2008.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; From this thread, what I=\r\n take is that pre-defined media-types are known knowledge for a REST API pu=\r\nblisher and consumer.\n\nYes. Think of it this way: REST moves all coupling f=\r\nrom the interface into the message body types. In addition, REST encourages=\r\n two things:\n\n1. Punctual evolution; some peers can agree on extensions and=\r\n use\n   them without breaking the other system participants\n2. Standardizat=\r\nion of message body types (in order to minimize\n   punctual integration)\n\nI=\r\ndeally: what works on a punctual basis and seems of value to the general pu=\r\nblic (be it &#39;the Web&#39; or some enterprise) should be moved into a standard e=\r\nventually.\n\nExample: in order for you to build a user agent that can talk t=\r\no amazon.com you only need to look at the HTML spec, not call Amazon. Vice =\r\nversa: in order for \nAmazon to implement an service they need not call thei=\r\nr customers, they only need to look at HTML. This concept is the same regar=\r\ndless of how much the user is involved (how many automated requests your us=\r\ner agent is programmed to make).\n\n\n&gt; That is the out of band information th=\r\nat everyone would need to know to make things &quot;work&quot;.\n\nRight. All coupling =\r\nis done on a global basis (ideally).\n\n&gt; Publisher needs to know this to mak=\r\ne sure they fit the data in the right format/container/media-type/watever a=\r\nnd consumer needs to know that to be able to handle the data properly.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n A bot/human/etc. parsing only text/html probably can read application/svg+=\r\nxml but won&#39;t know what to do with it. A publisher providing only applicati=\r\non/atom+xml to bots looking for text/html would not work either.\n\nRight. An=\r\nd that is perfectly fine.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I understand the use of Content-Type and Ac=\r\ncept headers but my client won&#39;t work without knowledge of media types supp=\r\norted AND knowing which ones i MUST support from client side to be able to =\r\nparse/utilize the data from publisher. All of this is even before i start w=\r\nriting a client.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Am i correct or wayyyyy off?\n\nYes. Though it is of c=\r\nourse an iterative process in which clients learn, formats die, the world e=\r\nvolves....\n\nThe interesting thing is that the architectural style used does=\r\n not at all affect this conceptual foundation. WS-* etc. does not make this=\r\n fact of live go away, it only hides it behind IDL artifacts that suggest c=\r\nontrol where there is none (due to the networked environment).\n\nREST makes =\r\nall this explicit and forces you to deal with it instead of being surprised=\r\n later in the day.\n\nHTH,\nJan\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, Aug 13, 2010 at 11:39 AM,=\r\n Eric J.

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a user age=\r\nnt concern, application/svg+xml is\n&gt; a ubiquitous media type, so any stakeh=\r\nolder with an interest knows what\n&gt; processing model any user agent needs t=\r\no support, regardless of intent\n&gt; (render vs. introspect for links).\n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\n&#39;d say that the needs of the resource drive the choice of media type,\n&gt; not=\r\n the needs of the user agent. Modeling a telephony system in HTML\n&gt; so that=\r\n it may be driven by a human using a browser is inappropriate to\n&gt; the need=\r\ns of the resource.\n&gt; \n&gt; If user agent =3D telephony device, then choice of =\r\ndevice should be\n&gt; driven by support for the media types the service uses. =\r\nJust as choice\n&gt; of browser should be driven by support for application/svg=\r\n+xml if the\n&gt; resource representations are best modeled as hypertext contro=\r\nls embedded\n&gt; within vector graphics.\n&gt; \n&gt; The obvious problem with my logi=\r\nc is that it depends upon free will.\n&gt; If the corporate intranet only allow=\r\ns IE, then the representations\n&gt; can&#39;t be application/svg+xml, so the needs=\r\n of the user agent are\n&gt; not driving choice of media type, but imposing art=\r\nificial restrictions\n&gt; on that choice. Which I see as a bad thing, hence my=\r\n advocacy for\n&gt; going the other way around...\n&gt; \n&gt; So, yeah, make &quot;supporte=\r\nd media types&quot; a function of resource modeling,\n&gt; without considering clien=\r\nt concerns. Choosing HTML should be driven by\n&gt; its appropriateness to the =\r\nresource, letting user agents take whatever\n&gt; form they need to take, using=\r\n the common knowledge of a ubiquitous\n&gt; media type to inform them of availa=\r\nble state transitions, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Eric\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n-----------------------------=\r\n------\n Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n NORD Software Consulting\n\n Mail: alger=\r\nmissen@...\n Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n Work: http://www.nordsc.=\r\ncom/\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
