It leaves me with another question though.  In my\nimplementation, I prefer to have methods like article.setPublished,\narticle.setDraft vs article.setMode(Article.PUBLISHED) and\narticle.setMode(Article.DRAFT).  It&#39;s just cleaner and better\nencapsulated, imo.\n\nIt seems to me though that on the web we&#39;re a bit more interested in\nstate, so perhaps PUT /articles/1/mode makes more sense.  It would be\nvery easy to use reflection to map from that request to the\nappropriate method on the article object.\n\nHow does that sound?\n\nPat\n\n"}}
