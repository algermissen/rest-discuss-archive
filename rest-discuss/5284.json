The only diff=\r\nerence is that\n&gt; in 2) the server can unilaterally enforce the scheme.\n\nMay=\r\nbe we can look on the intention of a request.\n\nIf a client request to serve=\r\nr, &quot;please use this XML data to create a\nnew entry&quot;.\nHere, &quot;create a new en=\r\ntry&quot; is the main intention. Therefore, we can\nsimply let the server\nto do a=\r\nll the job, and tell us the Location of that newly created entry.\n\nIf a cli=\r\nent request to server, &quot;please place this image file on that\nparticular pla=\r\nce,\nas it is already referenced in my article&quot;. Here, &quot;the location of the\n=\r\nimage file&quot; becomes\nimportant. So, it&#39;s wise for the client to provide the =\r\nactual location\nto server.\n\nWhen we create a new resource, PUT can be used =\r\nwhen &quot;the location&quot; of\nthe resource is rather important, and we want to spe=\r\ncify it ourselves.\n(In this case, if the location has been used, mostly the=\r\n old content\nwill be replaced by the new one).\n\nOtherwise, it&#39;s nice to jus=\r\nt POST your data to server, and let the\nserver to &quot;serve&quot; (to do all the jo=\r\nb for) you. :-)\n\nAny comments?\n\n--\n-toydi-\n\n"}}
