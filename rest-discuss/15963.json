Is there a way to do th=\r\nis so that a generic client\ncould deal with it?\nThe thought then occurred t=\r\nhat there doesn&#39;t seem to be a standardized\nway to define a hypermedia form=\r\nat. For example, while everyone agrees\nwhat a link looks like in HTML, this=\r\n is not the case for XML or even\nJSON (or YAML, or ...). Some blogs have be=\r\nen written about\n&lt;http://www.amundsen.com/blog/archives/1054&gt;   this\n&lt;http:=\r\n//www.subbu.org/blog/2008/04/hypermedia-and-json&gt;   and\nsuggestions have be=\r\nen made, but as far as I can tell, no consensus has\nemerged.\nAnd it&#39;s not o=\r\nnly links, it&#39;s also parameters that aren&#39;t defined in a\nstandardized way. =\r\nFor example, compare the definition of parameters here\n&lt;http://www.amundsen=\r\n.com/blog/archives/1054&gt;   (not containing info\nabout types and default val=\r\nues) with the definition of parameters here\n&lt;http://restx.mulesoft.org/rest=\r\nful-server-api&gt;   (includes type, default\nand is-mandatory info).\nSo, the q=\r\nuestion then is: Could/should we try to come up with a standard\nto describe=\r\n a custom hypermedia format? I&#39;m not talking about a\nblow-by-blow definitio=\r\nn of all available services and resources of a\nparticular application, but =\r\nabout something one level higher up: For\nexample, wouldn&#39;t it be nice if we=\r\n could agree on THE standard way to\ndescribe a link in JSON? Or in XML? And=\r\n then strive to always use this?\nOne could then say: I&#39;m using application/=\r\njson+foo for this (some custom\nformat), but it follows the standard way to =\r\ndescribe links and\nparameters.\nWhether this description itself can be forma=\r\nlized to the point where it\nis machine readable is another story. It would =\r\nforce clients to be a bit\nmore generic, but would also allow for quick adap=\r\ntations of a format if\nfor whatever reason the standard doesn&#39;t quite fit. =\r\nHowever, I&#39;d be\nhappy to just know that there is an agreed upon standard wa=\r\ny to define\nlinks, parameters and whatever else you need in JSON, XML and o=\r\nther\n&#39;base&#39; formats.\nConsider also that it would be very nice to point peop=\r\nle that are new to\nREST to such a &#39;standard document&#39;, since this topic oft=\r\nen seems to be\nvery mysterious and odd them.\nJust a thought...\nJuergen\n-- h=\r\nttp://restx.mulesoft.orgRESTx &lt;http://restx.org&gt;\n\n\n\r\n--7-5736849544-7851199496=:4\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;Hello!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Is there a standardized way to describ=\r\ne a new hypermedia format?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Let me provide some con=\r\ntext:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Yesterday, I had a long discussion on Twitte=\r\nr with Andrew Wahbe about the topic of whether it&#39;s even possible to create=\r\n a hypermedia format without knowledge of the client.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;More specifically, the concern was that whatever hypermedia format you =\r\ncome up with would &#39;bind&#39; the client to that server: It&#39;s difficult to have=\r\n a generic client, since instead you end up with clients that have to have =\r\nspecific knowledge about the particular hypermedia format you use.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There might be some public format you could use, but what =\r\nif you need to define your own?
