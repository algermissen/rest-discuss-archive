On the Web, you never\n&gt; just put together a POST request out of the blue. You browse to a page\n&gt; containing a form surrounded by text that tells you what posting the form\n&gt; is going to accomplish. The request itself needs no more information than\n&gt; the POST method and the URI to which it applies to identify its &quot;meaning&quot;;\n&gt; the users&#39; expectations are set by whatever the page containing the form\n&gt; tells them.\n\nYes!  &quot;REST = GET/PUT/POST/DELETE.&quot; misses this.\n\nExcept often a hidden &quot;dispatch&quot; or &quot;operation&quot; form-field is required\nto actually determine the intent of the form... but it&#39;s important that\nthe server provided those tokens in the first place.\n\nWhat I&#39;m trying to figure out is: if that document is in a *mumble*DL\nfile completely external to the service, and barely even mentioned in\nthe interaction with the site, is that still RESTful?  Why?  How? \nWhat&#39;s the critical distinction?  How does the client then determine\nchanges in the service provided to clients?\n\n\n&gt; That&#39;s probably not what you meant, Josh, but I&#39;ve just been waiting for\n&gt; an opportunity to bash PUT and DELETE. ;}\n\nNo, it&#39;s quite close to what I meant, actually...\n\nIf PUT and DELETE were critically required for something, then they&#39;d be\nimplemented widely in browsers by now.  They&#39;re not, thus what does that\nimply?\n\nTo me, it implies:\n\n* the GET=read, POST=read/write distinction is fundamental one; further \n  subdivisions of the semantics of either have a high threshold before \n  being accepted.\n\n  * PUT/DELETE may not be the right other things to codify for the \n    human-browseable web.\n\n  * they may be right for other machine/machine scenarios, but other \n    things are required [atomic-TAKE, batch-GET, &c...?]\n\n* the server instructing the client what operation are available and \n  possible for to transitions to next via forms are sufficient for a \n  lot of behavior.\n\n* most of this is predicated on a human interpreting HTML, at least \n  initially.  Surely, people have been doing screen-scraping, but only \n  after human interaction.\n\n\n&gt; (And don&#39;t even get me *started* on &quot;CRUD&quot;.)\n\nHeh. :)\n\n\n...jsled\n\n-- \nhttp://asynchronous.org/ - `a=jsled; b=asynchronous.org; echo ${a}@${b}`\n\n"}}
