I&#39;ve got to think of a way to explain it\n&gt; better.  I&#39;ve tried every approach I can think of.\n&gt;\n&gt; If we can do this, I expect we&#39;ll see a mass &quot;A ha!&quot; moment, and Web\n&gt; services will come crumbling down.\n&gt;\n&gt; BTW, a message where Mike Champion also misses the point in talking\n&gt; about firewalls, is here;\n&gt;\n&gt; http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-ws-arch/2003Jan/0321.html\n&gt;\n&gt; Please respond with any examples, or brief explanations, that you feel\n&gt; might help out.

I would agree that, for example, an SMTP\n&gt; &gt; message isn&#39;t visible to an HTTP intermediary.  But there&#39;s shared\n&gt; &gt; knowledge on application semantics in the HTTP/HTTP case.\n&gt;\n&gt; If the _whole_ content of the application and it&#39;s semantics can be\n&gt; derived from RFC 2616, then yes. HTTP semantics are visible to HTTP\n&gt; intermediaries.\n&gt;\n&gt; But as acres of earlier mail should have made clear, I don&#39;t believe\n&gt; that the semantics of Web services can be fully captured at the level\n&gt; of HTTP.\n&gt;\n&gt; Let&#39;s face it, HTTP isn&#39;t even enough for plain hypertext ... the HTML\n&gt; REC isn&#39;t an appendix of RFC 2616 ;-)\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Miles\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- End forwarded message -----\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Mark Baker.
