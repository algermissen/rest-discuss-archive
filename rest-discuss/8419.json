A client would need to know their semantics in order \n&gt; to use them correctly, right?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Also, what about when a client doesn&#39;t want to just view (GET) the \n&gt; state, but also to update it, how can he know how data should be sent to \n&gt; the server, just based on representation?\n\nThat&#39;s not a problem specific to the REST style, or even computing. What \nit does it put that problem in an appropriate place. &quot;What about meaning \n?&quot; is the same kind of question as &quot;what about latency?&quot;.\n\nAnother way of looking at it: just because the REST style does a decent \njob of managing the related complexity of interlingua, even going as far \nas shining some light on it, it doesn&#39;t mean the associated complexity \nis causal to the style.\n\nIt would help if we dropped the term &quot;self-description&quot; in favor of \nsomething less aggrandizing. Anyone with a basic grasp of formal \nlanguages or mathematical logic knows self-description is the linguistic \nanalog of perpetual motion.\n\ncheers\nBill\n\n"}}
