See Postel&#39;s law.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.google.com/search?q=postel+law\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tomcat offers me response.setStatus(SC_OK) for the former,\n&gt; &gt; Any suggestions what the latter might be please, if indeed\n&gt; &gt; there should be any response? Is the status response simply\n&gt; &gt; to indicate that content has been received, bad content or\n&gt; &gt; other  not being an http error?\n\n&gt; There is always a response. You should set the status\n&gt; code, and use the entity body of your response to give a\n&gt; human or machine friendly description of what happened,\n&gt; depending on what type of agent made the request.\n\nThat makes sense Vincent. \n\n&gt; \n&gt; I think you need to refer to the HTTP and Servlet specs.\n&gt; SC_OK etc. are just hard-coded constants that correspond with the\n&gt; HTTP Status Codes.\nSorry, SC_OK is the 200 code.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Section 10 lists the status codes and their semantics. The\n&gt; spec is clear on this topic. If you still have questions\n&gt; after reading it, feel free to post them here.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Would the more restful approach be to indicate at another\n&gt; &gt; URL that the post failed?\n&gt; \n&gt; Not really. The best approach is to signal the error with\n&gt; a code such as 400 Bad Response. From the HTTP spec at\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.1\n&gt; \n&gt; 10.4.1 400 Bad Request\n\nI guess that&#39;s a part of my problem? There was no request to be bad?\nI&#39;m just accepting posted data, hence 400 seems wrong?\n Or should I be interpreting &#39;request&#39; in a more general sense\nthan an http get?\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt;    The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed\n&gt;    syntax. The client SHOULD NOT repeat the request without\n&gt;    modifications.\n&gt; \n&gt; This corresponds to the SC_BAD_REQUEST constant:\n&gt; http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-5.5-doc/servletapi/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletResponse.html#SC_BAD_REQUEST\n&gt; \n&gt; I think this is a direct match for what you are proposing because\n&gt; XML is syntax.\n\nThanks. Julian suggested the same logic. \n\nI prefer the idea of both a status code and content (xml message),\njust unsure if it was right.\n\nThanks.\n\nDaveP.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
