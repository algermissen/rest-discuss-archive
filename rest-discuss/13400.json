Maybe not clearly\n&gt; stated at first, but I&#39;ve at least refined the message on the website.\n&gt;\n&gt; Whether or not REST-* continues to be the name is still debatable, but\n&gt; whatever name it ends up being will have &quot;REST&quot; within it.  You guys  \n&gt; are\n&gt; just going to have to deal with it.  If REST is positioned as a\n&gt; paradigm, as an idea, you can&#39;t say any one person, company, or\n&gt; organization cannot use it to promote whatever they are doing however\n&gt; good or bad.  Imagine if the same tact was taken with the coined  \n&gt; phrase\n&gt; Object-Oriented-Programming?  Or even worse, as you say, it was\n&gt; trademarked?  If it had, OOP wouldn&#39;t have been called OOP, it would\n&gt; have been called entirely something else.\n&gt;\n&gt; Roy&#39;s role is a good one.  IMO, it is Roy&#39;s (and other&#39;s) job to keep\n&gt; everybody focused.  One could question his tactics, but personally I\n&gt; prefer abrasiveness and bluntness.  Even though I was pretty  \n&gt; demoralized\n&gt; by his initial comments, somebody, expecially the creator, has to hold\n&gt; the banner for RESTful purity and bash people into submission as  \n&gt; much as\n&gt; possible.  But to say you cannot use REST the name (or REST the brand)\n&gt; if we are not pure, or even worse, because one or two of you don&#39;t  \n&gt; agree\n&gt; with what somebody is doing is just completely unproductive.  You have\n&gt; to let individuals, companies, and organizations come to terms with  \n&gt; REST\n&gt; in their own way and at their own pace.  As REST goes from the early\n&gt; adopters to mainstream, there is going to be confusion.  People will  \n&gt; get\n&gt; it completely and utterly wrong, but IMO, this is part of the process.\n&gt; For myself, I am completely open to learning what the &quot;right&quot; way is,\n&gt; but you&#39;re just not going to convince me there is no place for\n&gt; middleware or middleware services within REST.\n&gt;\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Bill Burke\n&gt; JBoss, a division of Red Hat\n&gt; http://bill.burkecentral.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
