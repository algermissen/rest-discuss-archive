I know the verb PUT should be used with with the 201 \nCreated code but what should the target of the verb be?\n\nCurrently I&#39;m using: \nPUT /app/rest/container/new\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;\n...\n\nWhere &#39;new&#39; is a special dummy object which represents an \nuninitialized objects.\n\nThe standard response is:\n\nHTTP 201 Created\nLocation: /app/rest/container/4242 (eg)\nHost: http://www.example.com\n\nOther possible responses include 402 Payment Required, 403 Forbidden, \n413 Request Entity Too Large.\n\nMy questions:\n\n1) What is the best way to indicate error to the client when the \nclient sends malformed XML to the server? I&#39;m not sure whether 407 \nNot Acceptable, 409 Conflict, or 400 Bad Request is best. Currently I \nuse 400 but the rfc says this error code should be avoided and the \nserver should aim to be as specific as possible.\n\n2) Does it make sense to have a dummy &#39;new&#39; resource that is the \ntarget of resource creation request? You could ask what the result of \nGET /app/rest/container/new is and I&#39;m not sure since it rarely makes \nsense. This leads me to believe resource creation should be done by a \nPOST to the container where POST means &#39;Append&#39;. The rfc is not \ncompletely clear on the difference in this unique case--it seems to \nindicate either PUT or POST works.\n\n3) When the client is generating entities who is responsible for \ngenerating etags? The server is usually responsible because the \nserver usually generated the resource, but when the client does \nresource generation should it have the burden of generating etags \ntoo? Should clients be trusted to generate etags?\n\nThanks for your advice.\n\n- inthedarkplace\n\n\n"}}
