A similar approach can be taken to change or delete the\n&gt; link (i.e. PUT & DELETE). (Note that attachments are not identified as a\n&gt; sub-resource in their own right as they are simply links and as such it is\n&gt; not really necessary to expose them separately).\nWithout an independent URI for the added link, you can&#39;t DELETE the link\n(since you can&#39;t identify the link you want to delete).\nYou&#39;d have to PUT the full patient record with a list of all the links minus\nthe one you don&#39;t want.\n\n\n&gt; Now the security issues come into play. Suppose that for obvious reasons\nyou\n&gt; want to be able to restrict who can add, update or delete particular types\n&gt; of attachments.\n&gt; Without having individual sub-resources for each of the types in question\n&gt; there appears to be no way to setup this style of security using ACL. If\nyou\n&gt; do choose the sub-resources approach, what happens when your security\n&gt; requirements change? Do you then have to change your resources to match?\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there something I am missing in my understanding of the use of ACL in\n&gt; REST, as this approach appears too fragile and inter-dependant for my\nliking?\n&gt;\nCan you provide a concrete example of ACL as it applies to these resources\nso we know what you are seeing from your perspective.\n\nIf I had an ACL system that was aware of HTTP messages, I could filter on\nportion of the message - method, content-type, user-id, etc.:\n\n&lt;acl&gt;\n&lt;ace&gt;\n&lt;grant&gt;\n &lt;principal&gt;/robert&lt;/principal&gt;\n &lt;method&gt;POST&lt;/method&gt;\n &lt;content-type&gt;*&lt;/content-type&gt;\n&lt;/grant&gt;\n&lt;deny&gt;\n &lt;principal&gt;/mike&lt;/principal&gt;\n &lt;method&gt;POST&lt;/method&gt;\n &lt;content-type&gt;application/vnd.leftwitch.billing+xml&lt;/content-type&gt;\n&lt;/deny&gt;\n&lt;/ace&gt;\n&lt;/acl&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
