For the same reason you want uniformity in\n&gt; &gt; methods, you want one preferred URI for identifying a\n&gt; &gt; resource.

Althought that&#39;s not\n&gt; &gt; quite what you are asking, I think it is the answer.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m curious why you make the above statement. Is there a W3C  \n&gt; finding that documents this, or some other paper? I&#39;ve been doing a  \n&gt; significant amount of research on URLs and URI best practices in  \n&gt; the past 3+ months and have found nothing like this (though I could  \n&gt; have missed it.)\n\nIt is inherent in the power laws of economics, the network effect\nof Metcalfe, the PageRank of Google, and I am sure it is mentioned\nsomewhere in webarch.  A gave a presentation to the W3C Tech Plenary\nthat described it using a single graph that is bisected when other\nsites start referring to two separate URIs for the same resource.\n\nWhen the best resources on the Web are identified by the sites\nthat link to them, introducing multiple URIs for the same resource\nhas the effect of exponentially decreasing its perceived value.\n\nIt also decreases cache efficiency, but resource owners don&#39;t\nrespect that as much as the PageRank argument.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
