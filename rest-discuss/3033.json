I can extract an integer data element out of an Amazon REST resource\nwithout a single line of code (unless you count an XPointer as &quot;code&quot;).\n\n &gt; As it happens, with an &quot;XSLT execution environment provider&quot; you\n &gt; probably could do something very similar with the SOAP service without\n &gt; a great deal of difference in the complexity or overhead either on the\n &gt; client or the server. But that&#39;s a different can&#39;o&#39;worms.\n\nThe client is a web browser. Heck, it could be Lynx or the command line \nbrowser. The complexity is in forcing the end-user to install a SOAP \nclient. That&#39;s a great deal of difference.\n\n   Paul Prescod\n\n\n\n\n"}}
