What are some use cases where REST should not be used? Since I&#39;m\n&gt; advocating a RESTful implementation of Linda tuple spaces, I&#39;d like to\n&gt; know if my use cases falls into this category!\n\nTo be honest, probably not. ;) ;(\n\nHere&#39;s why I say that: REST has its own kind of interaction model, just\nas tuple spaces do. I think that putting one on top of the other will\ndegrade the benefits of both. It is a little like putting objects in a\nrelational databases or relations in an object database etc.\n\n&gt; &gt; Understanding what those boundaries are (and I can&#39;t think of any)\n&gt; &gt; would be very illuminating.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hmmm... No cases where REST should not be used? This sounds like religious\n&gt; enthusiasm to me....\n\nI believe that REST is not appropriate for first person shooters (as an\nexample). Performance would be a huge problem in trying to maintain\nREST&#39;s statelessness. Realtime 3D video games cannot even afford to be\n&quot;stateless enough&quot; to meet their own security requirements (that&#39;s why\nthe send extra information before it is needed and that informatio is\nused by cheater software).\n-- \n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
