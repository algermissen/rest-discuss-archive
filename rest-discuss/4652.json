Thanks for taking the time \n&gt; to\n&gt; do this.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Overview - The main ideas behind REST are [...]&quot;\n&gt; The Overview only mentions retrieval of representations.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;REST Characteristics - Clients &quot;pull&quot; resource representations from\n&gt; server.&quot;\n&gt; There is more to state transfer than retrieval. Clients can &#39;push&#39; content\n&gt; to any reachable endpoint.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;No server-side state is used to process the request.&quot;\n&gt; I know what you mean, but this might be a bit confusing for a newcomer.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Responses can be labeled as &quot;cacheable&quot; so clients know if it is safe to\n&gt; cache responses for performance reasons. &quot;\n&gt; Excellent. I always forget to mention this.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;PUT - creates a new resource or modifies an existing resource and \n&gt; typically\n&gt; returns the resource URL&quot;\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure the resouce URI is actually returned, since PUT requires the\n&gt; URI in the incoming request. POST sometimes returns the ID of a newly\n&gt; created resource.\n&gt;\n&gt; The CRUD discussion is a little unclear. PUT is used to set the state of \n&gt; an\n&gt; identified resource regardless of whether it existed before - sort of like\n&gt; an UPSERT in the SQL world. And POST is used for both create and update\n&gt; operations, but the distinction isn&#39;t visible in the HTTP. A little more\n&gt; discussion & comparison/contrast in this area may help some of the \n&gt; audience.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I like the idea of providing a set of Java classes for application\n&gt; developers - that&#39;s an under-served audience in this area.\n&gt; If you are extremely bored, you might want to look at\n&gt; http://xml.apache.org/projects/xang/ for an older Java servlet-based\n&gt; framework for REST based applications (you have to get past some of the\n&gt; blather and look at the code, I really should dust off that code and\n&gt; simplify the docs...). But really, for this stuff, once a developer\n&gt; understands the ideas, the &#39;framework&#39; is only a very small amount of \n&gt; code.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, for a good Java HTTP client library, take a look at Apache&#39;s Commons\n&gt; project http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;REST is not appropriate for stateful applications&quot;\n&gt; You should also mention that stateful applications are not appropriate for\n&gt; the Web (or scalability, etc.).\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;REST isn&#39;t currently preferred over SOAP by major players&quot;\n&gt; Hmm, I work at a little bookstore in Seattle & we use REST style software\n&gt; all the time.\n&gt; Perhaps you meant by major vendors?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;R.
