I would vote\nfor &#39;b&#39; (although I was unaware it had a well-defined specific\npurpose).  I typically use it for two purposes:\n\n1. batch deletes:  I have a url that retrieves all items marked for\ndeletion as text/uri-list.  I can then iterate those, sending an http\nDELETE to each.\n\n2. I use them for an &quot;ingest&quot; function.  I have an &quot;ingester&quot;\nend-point I can POST to (it accepts &#39;text/uri-list&#39;) which will do a\nGET on the body of the post (generally just a single uri, i.e. a list\nw/ one member). That way I can do the equivalent of an AtomPub\nPOST-to-media-collection but the media item lives at a given uri, not\non my desktop.\n\nWould be curious to hear if these uses sound virtuous, evil or\nsomewhere in the middle.\n\n--peter keane\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Jan 5, 2009 at 12:30 PM, Stefan Tilkov &lt;stefan.tilkov@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; And another slightly OT post (feel free to point me to a more\n&gt; appropriate list):\n&gt;\n&gt; What&#39;s people&#39;s opinion about using text/uri-list, defined in [1], as\n&gt; a generic format for lists of URIs? The RFC says it&#39;s intended for a\n&gt; specific purpose, namely identification of replicated resources. So\n&gt; would it be better to a) invent a new media type in the vnd tree, b)\n&gt; use text/uri-list beyond its original scope or c) draft a new RFC for\n&gt; this?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Stefan\n&gt; --\n&gt; Stefan Tilkov, http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
