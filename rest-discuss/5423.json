Knowing the representation format alone isn&#39;t enough , \nyou need to know how to plug your data into that format, browsers know \nabout application/x-www-form-urlencoded but still require HTML forms to \nfill it. Whether the form is part of the main representation or another \nresource linked from it doesn&#39;t matter, just having it somewhere make \nyou more RESTful. I think I&#39;m starting to understand the whole forms \nlanguage thing now.\n\n"}}
