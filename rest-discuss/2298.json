Are these ideas based on experience in some judicial\n&gt; system or another?  Or are they systems analysts views of where the\n&gt; authoritative data in a transaction *ought to* be found?\n\nNo, I have no experience with electronic legal contracts other than\nsimple B2C credit card transactions.\n\n&gt; My own opinion, based on judges and arbitrators I have faced in\n&gt; contract matters, is that they want a context from which to judge\n&gt; what constitutes the contract in question, and they don&#39;t like\n&gt; other people constraining them in their judgment of how wide or\n&gt; narrow that context should be.\n\nThe question is whether the system is designed so that their job is \n\n a) doable\n b) relatively easy\n\nStatelessness helps with both of these. If I can print out a single,\nURI-addressble signed XML resource that describes a contract versus a\nhundred RPC messages from a log, then I think they will prefer that. If\nthey also want to look at my HTTP logs and other probably irrelevant\nresources then that&#39;s up to them.\n\n&gt; I think that judges and juries for that matter are interested in\n&gt; conversational state, not just in discrete &#39;stable states&#39; of a\n&gt; negotiation.\n\nIn general I would expect them to focus on the final contract rather\nthan (for example) the hundreds of iterations that pass around during\nnegotiation. This will be even more the case when the &quot;negotiators&quot; are\ncomputers and where the negotiations cannot be used as hints towards\nhuman intent. Computers will also tend to use predefined contracts\nbecause they aren&#39;t smart enough to write their own. Therefore the most\nrelevant question will often be: &quot;Did you really agree to this\npredefined contract or not?&quot;\n-- \n Paul Prescod\n\n"}}
