However I don&#39;t buy the metadata argument. What at&#39;s the end of \nthe URI is a resource, not a file. Resources are known only be their \nrepresentations. If those representations are stored in a file system, \nfine; but they may be stored other ways.\n\nThe client operating through PUT or DELETE or MOVE has no reason to know \nor care about any metadata that never appears in the representation. If \nthe metadata is somehow visible then it needs to be encoded in the \nmethod body or HTTP headers that the client PUTs to the server. \nOtherwise it&#39;s irrelevant like any other form of server state.\n\n-- \nï»¿Elliotte Rusty Harold  elharo@...\nXML in a Nutshell 3rd Edition Just Published!\nhttp://www.cafeconleche.org/books/xian3/\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0596007647/cafeaulaitA/ref=nosim\n\n"}}
