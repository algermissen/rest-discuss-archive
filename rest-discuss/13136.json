It is therefore not \n&gt; dependent upon the representation. eg. if I am being shown an \n&gt; itinerary for my approval prior to a final booking, I am in the state \n&gt; of reviewing the itinerary - irrespective of whether the itinerary was \n&gt; being rendered as XHTML, JSON, XML, PDF or PNG.\n\nI&#39;m not sure if I understand the distinction you make between \napplication and resource state\n\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;         b) How is a bookmark adequately defined ? This is really a\n&gt;         question for the author of a browser to answer. If we had a\n&gt;         browser which say allowed you to also describe the accept\n&gt;         headers before making the URI, then let us for a moment\n&gt;         suggest that such a browser the bookmark perhaps could contain\n&gt;         the accept header. However we don&#39;t have such browsers (I\n&gt;         haven&#39;t seen one at least). But it is likely that programmatic\n&gt;         clients may want to choose to store such URIs for say resuming\n&gt;         later. Such a browser is again unlikely to &#39;break&#39; if it is\n&gt;         able to accept and parse various content types with equal\n&gt;         capability or works with only one content type which it always\n&gt;         specifically requests. However it could break if in a\n&gt;         particular situation it has requested a particular resource\n&gt;         with a non default accept headers and that is specifically\n&gt;         needed to resume further. In such a situation, perhaps the\n&gt;         bookmark could store the accept header.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     That is, essentially, what I was suggesting\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, thats what I had assumed you were referring to - I was on the \n&gt; other hand attempting to separate the notion of the bookmark and the \n&gt; application state - ie. they are not one and the same.\n\nIf a bookmark is not a stored reference to a given application state, \nwhat is it?\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;         But even in this case the accept headers imo are not an\n&gt;         attribute of the application state - they are an application\n&gt;         of the conversation state (though I am open to be challenged\n&gt;         since I myself am not so terribly convinced about it).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     I don&#39;t know if I understand what you mean by &#39;application of the\n&gt;     conversation state&#39; - but there is no room for a state between\n&gt;     application and resource, given communication in RESTful systems\n&gt;     is (supposed to be) stateless.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Sorry, made a mistake there - should&#39;ve stated &quot; the accept headers \n&gt; imo are not an attribute of the application state - they are an \n&gt; _*attribute*_ of the conversation state&quot;. Though reading it again I \n&gt; feel a little lame. I should&#39;ve been more specific and should&#39;ve said \n&gt; &quot;the accept headers imo are not an attribute of the application state \n&gt; - they are merely the influencers of a representation as a part of a \n&gt; given conversation&quot;\n&gt;\n\nIf they are influencing the representation transfered, they are \nimpacting on the application state. I can agree that there is no \ndifference between the resource state, but that is desired behavior from \nnegotiated representations of the same resource.\n\n- Mike\n\n"}}
