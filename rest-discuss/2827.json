It\n&gt; seems like Mark is saying &quot;request-headers&quot; should mean any header in the\n&gt; request message? BTW, I&#39;d like this better, cause then you could Vary on\n&gt; extension headers. But, then I&#39;d expect the rfc to say something like &quot;any\n&gt; request header&quot;.\n\nHmm, interesting, I never noticed that.  Not sure what the general\nimplications of it are, or if it&#39;s a bug, but at least there&#39;s this\nbit from 12.1 to cover your Vary question;\n\n  &quot;However, an\n   origin server is not limited to these dimensions and MAY vary the\n   response based on any aspect of the request, including information\n   outside the request-header fields or within extension header fields\n   not defined by this specification.&quot;\n\n&gt; But, practically, what&#39;s the impact of this? Is an intermediary justified in\n&gt; rejecting a response message if it has illegal headers in it? E.g., could a\n&gt; firewall fail to pass thru a response containing a &quot;Vary: foobar&quot; header\n&gt; (where foobar is some extension header from the request)? Or could a cache\n&gt; ignore the unrecognized Vary header fields and return the wrong page to a\n&gt; subsequent request? (Of course, a broken firewall or cache could do anything\n&gt; ... I&#39;m talking about &quot;correct per the rfc&quot; behavior.)\n\nHTTP&#39;s processing model is a bit loose, but basically most software out\nthere is &quot;liberal in what it receives&quot; meaning that they won&#39;t likely\nreject a message for containing a header which it doesn&#39;t recognize.\n\nMB\n-- \nMark Baker.
