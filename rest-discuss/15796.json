I think it can provide &quot;AED&quot; level &quot;transactions&quot;: atomic, eventually consistent, and durable. The individual operations take a long time or might fail, so I can add a long running operation mechanism and if one of the remote operations fail, I implement &quot;rollback&quot; by invoking all the compensating transaction for the original operation.\n\nWhat would be nice is if there were a standard media type that the endpoints offering the operations could advertise as a way to tell the batch operation processor how to map the main operations to their corresponding compensations. Although one simple way to do this would be to assure we always invoke such operations via PUT and then we simply DELETE to the same URL to &quot;undo&quot;.\n\n\n\n----- Original Message ----\nFrom: Jan Algermissen &lt;algermissen1971@...&gt;\n\nOn Jul 4, 2010, at 10:10 PM, bryan_w_taylor wrote:\n\n&gt; If I need to distribute it, I can use guaranteed delivery.\n\nAre you saying that this solves the distributed transaction problem?\n\nJan\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
