Have you thought about generalizing it a bit? I \n&gt; mean, I\n&gt; prefer RSS 1.0 to RSS 2.0, and I think RESTlog would be more useful if \n&gt; you\n&gt; didn&#39;t specify so much about how messages are stored on the server side;\n&gt; both physically and w/r/t to format...\n&gt;\nThanks. I have been slowly trying to seperate out the documentation into \n&#39;specification&#39;\nand &#39;implementation&#39;. Based on your feedback I added some more verbage to\nmake the distinction clearer. Let me know if it&#39;s sufficient:\n\nhttp://wellformedweb.org/news/2\n\n&gt;\n&gt; It might be nice to make a capability discovery URI, like:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://foo.bar/message-types\n&gt;\n&gt; which one could GET and which would return an XML doc (actually, RDF \n&gt; would\n&gt; be ideal for this) describing which formats the RESTlog could \n&gt; understand and\n&gt; store, among other things.\n&gt;\nHeheh, RDF isn&#39;t really a match philisophicly. Have you read my essay\nthat stimulated the creation of the WellFormedWeb site?\nhttp://wellformedweb.org/story/1\n\nDiscovery is a big area and I have seen a lot of proposals in this area, \nfrom\nRDF, the OPTIONS HTTP verb, WSIL, RSD, etc. This was discussed in relation\nto RESTLog on [ucapi-discuss]:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/ucapi-discuss/message/3\n\n&gt;\n&gt; In other words, RESTlog looks neat, but if I were going to use it for\n&gt; projects, I&#39;d want to store messages not in files on the filesystem \n&gt; but in,\n&gt; say, ZODB (or MySQL), and I&#39;d want to have more flexibility in the \n&gt; sorts of\n&gt; message types a client could expect to POST.\n&gt;\nThere is a mention of RSS 2.0 in the &#39;implementation&#39; sections in\nwhich demonstrate how I link up the individual &#39;item&#39;s into &#39;index.rss&#39;. \nNow that&#39;s implementation\nso we can safely ignore it. I.e. it&#39;s not part of the spec.\n\nThe other part where RSS 2.0 raises it&#39;s head is in the creation and \nediting of posts.\nAre you asking that the &#39;item&#39; fragment be from RSS 1.0? As I understand \nit that would\nrequire putting the &#39;item&#39; element in a different namespace. Is there \nany benefit\nfrom making that change? Let me know if I am missing something.\n\nYou may also want to look at James Snell&#39;s proposed extensions to RESTLog:\nhttp://www.snellspace.com/blog/archives/000127.html\n\n    Thanks,\n    -joe\n\n--\nhttp://BitWorking.org\nhttp://WellFormedWeb.org\n\n\n\n\n"}}
