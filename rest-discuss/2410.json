However,\nI am losing all understanding of what resource state actually is...\n\n\nA resource has a state. One can only retrieve a representation of the\ncurrent state of a resource.\n\nBut then we are told that we can receive different representations of the\nsame state.  For instance, the same resource could be returned in different\nspoken languages or in different content-types.  However, these are both\nindicated by HTTP headers and not within the returned entity itself.\nHowever, it you look at the infamous &quot;hit counter&quot;, the returned entity\ncould differ between calls.  But it seems to me that people are saying that\nthe state hasn&#39;t necessarily changed.\n\nIf this is true, then it seems to me that the concept of &quot;state&quot; is more of\na logical (?) concept than a physical (?) concept.  In other words, state is\nsubjective.  One person may say that the state of a resource means one thing\nwhile another person would say that the state of another resource means\nsomething entirely different.  Is this true?  And if so, what is the value\nof talking about state when discussing REST?  Isn&#39;t this just adding one\nmore jargon word for us to all trip over?\n\nSigned,\nIn A State of Confussion\n\n(aka:\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n)\n\n\n"}}
