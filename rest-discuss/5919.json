So if anybody can provide a pointer, I&#39;d be really be  \n&gt; interested.\n\nThe only thing that recursive PROPFIND is used for within actual\nwebdav applications is directory listings.  Those are better implemented\nas a single resource that is defined by the collection itself, and\nwhose representation(s) are available at a distinct URI.\n\nThe most recent reference you are looking for is\n\n   http://xent.com/pipermail/fork/2001-August/003191.html\n\nwith particular attention to the second-to-last paragraph.\n\nMost of the other discussion was at the Xerox PARC and UCI f2f\nmeetings.  WebDAV made certain choices and is limited to Save As\ndialogs because of them.  WebDAV discussions are hopeless because\nthe WebDAV specifications redefined the meaning of resource to be\nthe same as file, thereby failing to handle the interesting cases\nof Web authoring in favor of duplicating FTP.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; That seems to be a problem with the concept of moving resources\n&gt;&gt;&gt; around, not with the actual definition of the MOVE method, right?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; No, it is a problem with specifying multiple arguments when both the\n&gt;&gt; syntax and the access control mechanism assume there is only one.\n&gt;&gt; It doesn&#39;t quite fit in the original HTTP syntax.\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s correct. So are you suggesting that there&#39;s a way to model a  \n&gt; move\n&gt; operation without specifying two arguments that should have been  \n&gt; used to\n&gt; define a MOVE-like method?\n\nNo.  It is possible to do so by exchanging representations of the\nbefore and after hierarchy, but I am not saying it should have been\ndone that way.  I was only saying that WebDAV failed to consider the\nimplications of how that change in method semantics impacts the rest\nof the HTTP model (particularly, access control and how to express\npartial failure conditions).\n\nWebDAV is history.  The only interesting discussion is how much,\nif anything, should be recovered from it when a replacement is\ndesigned.  Almost all of WebDAV&#39;s design rationales -- so-called\nperformance issues -- are obsolete as soon as the message syntax\nis no longer MIME.  What is the actual design rationale for locking\n(hint: it isn&#39;t the lost update problem)?  What resource is it\nthat WebDAV clients are actually looking for when they do recursive\nPROPFIND requests?  Where should namespace operations be targeted?\nThose are interesting questions.\n\n....Roy\n\n"}}
