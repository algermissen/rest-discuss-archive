Only when new processing models emerge should we mint new media types. IOW: as long as the media types you have available make correct candidates for the Content-Type header values we do not need new media types.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Processing model as in what though?  I&#39;m a little confused as to what that really means.  As a user I can use a browser (user agent) to peruse a list of orders on a web page.  But I could also write a program to do the same thing.  In both cases, my client ACCEPTs text/html, right?  At what point do I make the leap to minting a new media type?\n\nYeah - if I would have been able to explain it better I would have done it :-) So, I am with you on this question.\n\nWhat do you think about something like: &quot;text/html means: please understand the payload in terms of the HTML specification. When you process it, you can expect to find stuff like a title and (usually) haman targeted text portions, with inline images etc. You can also look for additional rendering stuff (via style sheets) and there might also be some referenced code on demand (JavaScript). There&#39;ll also be a bunch on inline links that you can as you see fit render to a human or automatically GET or bookmark or whatever.\n\nAtomPub&#39;s media types have a very different intended processing model. Especially it addressed to a certain extend how to deal with time ordered entries and checking at what point new entries have been added or old ones have been changed.\n\nI think you basically need new media types when you have new processing controls (see NewsML G2&#39;s pubStatus control (usable, withdrawn) for example) or when you have new domain entities such as orders etc. In the case of procurement, it would make sense to define application/procurement and have the necessary documents such as order, creditNote, billOfLading etc. in that media type.\n\nJan\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Eb\n\n-----------------------------------\n Jan Algermissen, Consultant\n NORD Software Consulting\n\n Mail: algermissen@...\n Blog: http://www.nordsc.com/blog/\n Work: http://www.nordsc.com/\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
