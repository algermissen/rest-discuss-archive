It&#39;s a black box. You use SMTP not really as\n&gt; a &quot;protocol&quot; but as an API for a particular piece of software you have\n&gt; that happens to do the queuing and retry that you want. I say &quot;API&quot;\n&gt; instead of &quot;protocol&quot; because the SMTP bit is only used within the web\n&gt; service and is never exposed to either the requester nor the responder.\n&gt;\n&gt; Maybe the implementation bit should be on a separate slide to make this\n&gt; clear. (do we intend to publicize this URI?)\n\nGood points.  I think that what&#39;s useful about the StoreAndForwardWebService\nimplementation is just proof of concept.  The slides should be clear about this.\n\nI already have to publicize the URL to the o&#39;reilly etech conf committee, since\nI am proposing a talk on the subject, so maybe we should also add it to the REST\nWiki and do any other marketing that seems appropriate.\n\n&gt; When you say this is a &quot;web app&quot; you mean what the industry calls web\n&gt; service. It is a web-based service that exposes some functionality:\n&gt; storing and forwarding.\n\nAmen.  I have incorporated that into the slides.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
