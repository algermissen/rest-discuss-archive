In this case the &quot;verb&quot; of this application is &quot;offer&quot;.  You\n&gt; are essentially invoking the &quot;make offer&quot; method for the offer taker.  The\n&gt; order document is certainly essential, but it is part of the transaction.\n\nI believe you want to be free of methods in a REST world.  REST talks \nabout transferring state, not requesting a service to change a state for \nyou.\n\nThe fact that a new purchase order is created (via PUT) triggers \ncertains events on the server.  You don&#39;t call &quot;make offer&quot; you just PUT \nyour offer.  The server then runs that offer through its state machine, \ngiving it to listeners, etc, etc.  It will then return to you a document \ndescribing the result (hopefully, a Receipt document).\n\n&gt; Again, I am suggesting that documents/data are important in services, but so\n&gt; are verbs/actions.\n\nThe verbs, or actions, exist as business logic in the server.  They \nshould be called directly by clients.  Two systems should not \ncommunicate via actions.  They should communicate via objects/documents. \n  That&#39;s what REST wants.  Eliminate the API from the protocol.  It will \nbe easier to communicate objects (things) to other systems, not actions.\n\nSeth\n\n\n"}}
