The emphasis is on the  \nmanipulation of data rather than on interfaces. Clients are supplied  \nthe entire state of a resource instead of calling an operation to  \nprovide some part of it. Fielding believes that in the context of the  \nInternet the proliferation of different service interfaces will not  \nbe as useful as a simple minimum uniform set of operations. When a  \nnew resource is created then it has a new URL by which it can be  \naccessed or updated.\n&lt;/quote&gt;\n\n(One wonders where the author takes the XML part from....)\n\nThe quote is at the start of the WS chapter which I find encouraging.\n\nJan\n\n"}}
