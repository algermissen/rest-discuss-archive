The RESTful approach to Web=\r\n services has also received a significant amount of attention from industry=\r\n as indicated by the numerous technical books being published on the topic.=\r\n\n\nThis first edition of WS-REST, co-located with the WWW2010 conference, ai=\r\nms at providing an academic forum for discussing current emerging research =\r\ntopics centered around the application of REST, as well as advanced applica=\r\ntion scenarios for building large scale distributed systems.\n\nIn addition t=\r\no presentations on novel applications of RESTful Web services technologies,=\r\n the workshop program will also include discussions on the limits of the ap=\r\nplicability of the REST architectural style, as well as recent advances in =\r\nresearch that aim at tackling new problems that may require to extend the b=\r\nasic REST architectural style. The organizers are seeking novel and origina=\r\nl, high quality paper submissions on research contributions focusing on the=\r\n following topics:\n\n    * Applications of the REST architectural style to n=\r\novel domains\n    * Design Patterns and Anti-Patterns for RESTful services\n =\r\n   * RESTful service composition\n    * Inverted REST (REST for push events)=\r\n\n    * Integration of Pub/Sub with REST\n    * Performance and QoS Evaluatio=\r\nns of RESTful services\n    * REST compliant transaction models\n    * Mashup=\r\ns\n    * Frameworks and toolkits for RESTful service implementations\n    * F=\r\nrameworks and toolkits for RESTful service consumption\n    * Modeling RESTf=\r\nul services\n    * Resource Design and Granularity\n    * Evolution of RESTfu=\r\nl services\n    * Versioning and Extension of REST APIs\n    * HTTP extension=\r\ns and replacements\n    * REST compliant protocols beyond HTTP\n    * Multi-P=\r\nrotocol REST (REST architectures across protocols)\n\nAll workshop papers are=\r\n peer-reviewed and accepted papers will be published as part of the ACM Dig=\r\nital Library. Two kinds of contributions are sought: short position papers =\r\n(not to exceed 4 pages in ACM style format) describing particular challenge=\r\ns or experiences relevant to the scope of the workshop, and full research p=\r\napers (not to exceed 8 pages in the ACM style format) describing novel solu=\r\ntions to relevant problems. Technology demonstrations are particularly welc=\r\nome, and we encourage authors to focus on &quot;lessons learned&quot; rather than des=\r\ncribing an implementation.\n\nPapers must be submitted electronically in PDF =\r\nformat.
