What that DELETE =\r\nmeans in my resource model on\n&gt; the server is not up to you to decide, but =\r\nyou can be told it through\n&gt; our common out-of-band understanding of the re=\r\nsource representations\n&gt; and interface. Of course, for this to work we both=\r\n need to understand\n&gt; and implement the meaning of the representation types=\r\n and the\n&gt; constrained interface.\n&gt; \n\nOf course you can have one DELETE req=\r\nuest remove more than one\nresource, in HTTP and even in REST.  The topic of=\r\n this thread, is how to\nhave the *client* orchestrate that request.  Which =\r\nis of course possible\nin a variety of ways, including having the server jus=\r\nt &quot;interpret it\nthat way&quot; when certain collections are deleted.  It just is=\r\nn&#39;t RESTful,\nbut if your API is mostly REST but needs this sort of thing fo=\r\nr ease-of-\nuse or pragmatic reasons anyway, that&#39;s just dandy.  Nothing wro=\r\nng with\na hybrid API.\n\nBut a hybrid API is the best you can do, if you are =\r\nrelying on a common\nout-of-band understanding of any sort, to change DELETE=\r\n into BDELETE\nfor some resources but not others.  If the intention of the A=\r\nPI is to\nallow the client to choose more than one resource to be deleted in=\r\n a\nsingle request, instead of instructing the client to perform multiple\nDE=\r\nLETE requests, then it just isn&#39;t REST.  Deleting other resources as\na side=\r\n effect is one thing; having the client dictate that side effect\nis another=\r\n.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; If you don=B4t give the bag of bagels an address, then you will find=\r\n\n&gt; you have a problem trying to delete it through &quot;restful&quot; http.  So if\n&gt; =\r\nit=B4s significant in your resource model, give it an address (or\n&gt; more). =\r\nIt is possible to to model this restful over http, removing\n&gt; resources at =\r\nother adresses as a respones to DELETE is *NOT* in\n&gt; itself &quot;unrestful&quot; use=\r\n of http. Don=B4t mix the two cases together.\n&gt; \n\nSo long as the deletion o=\r\nf those other resources is a side-effect, and\nnot somehow part of the clien=\r\nt request.  If the documentation for your\nAPI is describing how the client =\r\ncan create a new resource for the\npurpose of batch-deleting its members wit=\r\nh a single request, then it&#39;s\nthis out-of-band knowledge describing the int=\r\nerface, which is not using\nself-descriptive messages or HEAS.  This couples=\r\n together the evolution\nof client and server.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
