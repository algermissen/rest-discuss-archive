Basical=\r\nly, IE is not a RESTful client. \n\nHaving said that, lets assume that my fir=\r\nst suggestion is wrong and that you be RESTful on \na human facing website. =\r\nOr application does online banking. All transactions take multiple \nsteps (=\r\nat a minimum, there is the form, a confirmation and a reciept, although som=\r\ne \ntransaction like a repeating transfer into some external account have mu=\r\nltiple form steps). \nOur architect says that the RESTful approach is to hav=\r\ne a unique URL for every step of the \ntransaction, that doing so correctly =\r\nencodes all the States as resources. I argue that this is \nnot the case for=\r\n a few reasons:\n1) It doesn&#39;t correctly include all the States as error con=\r\nditions are not considered\n2) That its only a coincidence of our implementa=\r\ntion (its 5+ years old)  that a user needs \nto make several trips to the se=\r\nrver in order to complete a transaction. We could have just \nas easily buil=\r\nt an AJAXy UI which only makes one call to the server. This seems to me to =\r\nbe \nan architectural smell. \n3) That while it could make sense that one wou=\r\nld have a series of resources which \ntransform something (in this case form=\r\n parameters) into some intermediate state until that \nsomething is ready to=\r\n be POSTed to the &quot;real&quot; resource, it seems a contrivance.\n\nBy contrast, ou=\r\nr current implementation hides all the steps of the transaction behind a \ns=\r\ningle URL that the end user sees. The server code (which could be written a=\r\ns a RESTful \nclient for a RESTful online banking service) that the user mos=\r\nt directly interacts with is \nresponsible for determining, based on the inf=\r\normation provided, what content to send to \nthe browser, either the reciept=\r\n or some intermediate form. \n\nSo.. which of us is less wrong?\nAdam\n\n\n"}}
