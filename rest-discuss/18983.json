The first two examples were really kind of a lead\nin to the third which you didn&#39;t comment on.  Based on your explanation, it\nwould seem that as long as the user is confident that the server isn&#39;t\ngoing to mess with their stored cart, then there is no reason why the user\ncannot request that the contents of their stored cart be ordered.\n\nThe reality is that there needs to be a certain level of trust by the user\nin the service they are using.  Whether, the user-agent downloads the cart\nand re-posts it to an order processor, or the user-agent posts a link to\nstored cart, the intent of the user is the same and a user-agent can quite\neasily allow the user to preview the stored cart before posting the link to\nbe ordered.  I fail to see how a message that refers to a resource loses\nits self-descriptiveness.\n\nRegarding the need for the resource to be invariant is also a concern for\nme.  Consider the following processing endpoint that stores images of\nweather maps of cities.  If you post a text/url-list to it then it\ndereferences those urls and stores the resulting image.\n\nPOST /WeatherSnapshots\ncontent-type: text/url-list\nhttp://weathernetwork.com/miami/currentweather\n\nI don&#39;t see the benefit of forcing all the extra data transfer required to\ndo the following,\n\nGET http://weathernetwork.com/miami/currentweather\n=&gt;\n200\nContent-type: image/jpeg\n[bytes]\n\nPOST /WeatherSnapshots\ncontent-type: image/jpeg\n[bytes]\n\nImagine the scenario where several times a day a user wanted to take\nsnapshots of many cities at the same time.  It would be far more efficient\nfor the client to request that the server perform those requests on it&#39;s\nbehalf than have the client download each than then post them back to the\nserver.\n\nSorry for belabouring the point but it is an issue that does comes up\nfairly regularly and when asked about it I don&#39;t like having to respond,\n&quot;you aren&#39;t supposed to do this, but I don&#39;t understand why&quot;.  There&#39;s\nalready enough dogmatic REST advice going around and I&#39;d rather not\ncontribute to it.\n\nDarrel\n\r\n--f46d04182658d103b304c8083e21\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nHey Mark,&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thanks for the response. =A0The first two exam=\r\nples were really kind of a lead in to the third which you didn&#39;t commen=\r\nt on. =A0Based on your explanation, it would seem that as long as the user =\r\nis confident that the server isn&#39;t going to mess with their stored cart=\r\n, then there is no reason why the user cannot request that the contents of =\r\ntheir stored cart be ordered.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The reality is that=\r\n there needs to be a certain level of trust by the user in the service they=\r\n are using. =A0Whether, the user-agent downloads the cart and re-posts it t=\r\no an order processor, or the user-agent posts a link to stored cart, the in=\r\ntent of the user is the same and a user-agent can quite easily allow the us=\r\ner to preview the stored cart before posting the link to be ordered. =A0I f=\r\nail to see how a message that refers to a resource loses its self-descripti=\r\nveness.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Regarding the need for the resource to be=\r\n invariant is also a concern for me. =A0Consider the following processing e=\r\nndpoint that stores images of weather maps of cities. =A0If you post a text=\r\n/url-list to it then it dereferences those urls and stores the resulting im=\r\nage.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;POST /WeatherSnapshots&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;content-typ=\r\ne: text/url-list&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://weathernetwork.com/miami/curre=\r\nntweather&quot;&gt;http://weathernetwork.com/miami/currentweather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;\nI don&#39;t see the benefit of forcing all the extra data tran=\r\nsfer required to do the following,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;GET=A0&lt;a href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://weathernetwork.com/miami/currentweather&quot;&gt;http://weathernetwork.c=\r\nom/miami/currentweather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=3D&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;200&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;C=\r\nontent-type: image/jpeg&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[bytes]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;POST /We=\r\natherSnapshots&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;content-type: image/jpeg&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[bytes]=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;Imagine the scenario where several times a day a user wanted to take sna=\r\npshots of many cities at the same time. =A0It would be far more efficient f=\r\nor the client to request that the server perform those requests on it&#39;s=\r\n behalf than have the client download each than then post them back to the =\r\nserver.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Sorry for=A0belabouring=A0the point but it is an issue that=\r\n does comes up fairly regularly and when asked about it I don&#39;t like ha=\r\nving to respond, &quot;you aren&#39;t supposed to do this, but I don&#39;t =\r\nunderstand why&quot;. =A0There&#39;s already enough dogmatic REST advice go=\r\ning around and I&#39;d rather not contribute to it.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Darrel&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\r\n--f46d04182658d103b304c8083e21--\r\n\n"}}
