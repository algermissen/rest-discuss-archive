Now suppose further that any \nof the resources that begin with &quot;http://example.com/foo&quot; require \nauthorization.  There are two ways this could be handled in code:\n\n   1. look for the &quot;http://example.com/foo&quot; prefix, then send a 401\n      response if the user has not given authentication information.\n   2. look and make sure full URI is a valid resource, then send a 401\n      response if the user has not given authentication information.\n\nEach approach appears to have both advantages and disadvantages.\n\nApproach 1 (look for prefix):\n\n    * good: easy to implement\n    * good: an entire range (read &quot;nearly infinite&quot;) of URIs are\n      obscured.  In other words, you don&#39;t even know if a resource\n      exists if you haven&#39;t authenticated.\n    * bad:  supposing that a 401 response implies that the referenced\n      resource exists, then returning a 404 Not Found after\n      authenticating would seem wrong.\n\nApproach 2 (check for resource existence first):\n\n    * good: ensures that you only return a 401 response for actual\n      resources.\n    * bad: it may be harder to implement\n    * bad: this would potentially allow someone to map out the edges of\n      restricted areas.  At least this seems like a bad thing to me,\n      considering that many URIs tend to have (potentially valuable)\n      information embedded in them (even if we state that they are to be\n      treated as opaque strings by the client).\n\nAdmittedly, I may have overlooked some pros/cons for each side, but as \nit stands, the first approach looks more positive.
