If you check the preso I made it clear this was about http and\n&gt; enabling REST....\n&gt; \n\nRight, that&#39;s exactly what I was calling out for praise, sorry if it\ncame across as criticism.  As to the presentation, there was a Q&A\ndiscussion about the platform imposing design criteria on the system\nunder development, which you say you want to avoid.  But, your example\nof /foo/bar making bar a child of foo, would do precisely that.  I can\nthink of more situations where bar isn&#39;t a child of foo, in the\napplication sense, than situations where it is -- most of the time, I\nhave nothing there to inherit.  Unless you make that optional, but the\npresentation isn&#39;t clear in that regard, so this is just a note.\n\nThe other feedback I have is regarding Content-Location, not only for\nconneg but for situations like &quot;author&#39;s preferred version&quot;.  The demo\nshows that you can assign multiple representations to a resource.  But\nthis approach typically fails the identification of resources and self-\ndescriptive messaging constraints.  We&#39;ve discussed this here before,\nand I realize that I&#39;m in the minority on this, but it&#39;s still a SHOULD\nin HTTP.\n\nWhat I&#39;d like from a platform, is the ability to define first an Atom\nresource, then a JSON resource, *then* be able to define a resource\nwhich negotiates between them.  The problem with Accept-based conneg,\nis that you don&#39;t always have control over the client -- i.e. you can&#39;t\ntell a browser to negotiate between Atom and JSON without Code on\nDemand.  So there needs to be some way to link directly to the desired\nvariant, without conneg.  Among other reasons.  Some of my rationale\nrug was pulled out from under me with HTTPbis -11 about a day after the\nlast thread on this topic, but C-L with conneg is still a SHOULD, not a\nMAY, for very good reasons.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
