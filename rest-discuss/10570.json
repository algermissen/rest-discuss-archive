I don&#39;t see how this can  \nbe used to implement a &quot;protocol&quot; to delete a resource.\n\nOn Mar 28, 2008, at 1:01 AM, Eric J.

If I can use a 202\n&gt; response to DELETE which consists of a confirmation form, that form  \n&gt; can\n&gt; have a checkbox (default checked) for 410 Gone, unchecked means 404.\n&gt;\n&gt; If the client cancels or otherwise fails to submit the confirmation\n&gt; form, the DELETE never happens, which is fine because the 202 response\n&gt; doesn&#39;t promise success.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Eric\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
