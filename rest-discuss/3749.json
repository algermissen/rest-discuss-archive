For the fun of it, what\nabout the following architecture:\n\nPremise: I want to access my banking information.  I also want to share bits\nof it with my accountant.  The URL for the bank is http://my.bank.\n\n\n1) I GET http://my.bank/access.  The server returns an HTTP Authentication\nchallenge\n2) I re-submit the request with my credentials. The server authenticates me\nand returns a 201 with a Location of http://my.bank/access/12345.\n\nNote:  The returned URL is unique to me.  The HTTP Authentication headers\nhave no meaning at this point.  The URL has some constraints on its\nexistance. In this case, it only exists for 5 minutes between requests\n(resetting the timer after each request).\n\n3) I GET http://my.bank/access/12345.  The server returns the options\navailable to me:\n\n    http://my.bank/access/12345/options\n    http://my.bank/access/12345/accounts\n    http://my.bank/access/12345/reports\n\n4) I GET http://my.bank/access/12345/accounts.  The server returns a list of\naccounts:\n\n    http://my.bank/access/12345/accounts/checking\n    http://my.bank/access/12345/accounts/savings\n\n5) I GET http://my.bank/access/12345/accounts/checking.  The server returns\na list of transactions:\n\n    http://my.bank/access/12345/accounts/checking/456\n    http://my.bank/access/12345/accounts/checking/455\n    http://my.bank/access/12345/accounts/checking/454\n\n6) I GET http://my.bank/access/12345/accounts/checking/456.  The server\nreturns the details of the transaction.\n\n7) Also on the screen is an option that says &quot;send this page to:&quot; and an\ninput box.  I fill in my accountant&#39;s e-mail address, and press submit.  The\nform is POSTed to http://my.bank/proxy-access.  The form contains two\nfields:  the e-mail address and the current page&#39;s URL (which was\nhttp://my.bank/access/12345/accounts/checking/456).  The server e-mails the\nfollowing URL to my accountant: http://my.bank/proxy-access/56789.\n\nNote:  The link generated for the accountant only provides access to the\ngiven checking entry.  If I had wanted to give him access to my entire\nchecking account, I would have sent him\n&quot;http://my.bank/access/12345/accounts/checking&quot;, except that the URL she\nwould have received would show that page instead, with the contained URLs\nbeing:\n\n    http://my.bank/proxy-access/56789/456\n    http://my.bank/proxy-access/56789/455\n    http://my.bank/proxy-access/56789/454\n\nThe e-mailed URL would have a limited time limit such as 30 minutes, after\nwhich, the link will only return a 404 response or some such.\n\nNow, if I wanted to revoke access, I could just issue a DELETE on the URL.\nThere isn&#39;t even any need to authenicate the DELETE request.  Likewise, if I\nwanted to &quot;log out&quot;, I could DELETE my own URL.  If I forgot, both URLs\nwould have a limited lifetime anyhow, at the end of which only a 404\nresponse would be returned.\n\n\nObviously, this is a rather simple scenario.  But I think it illustrates a\nsimple, clean way of handling access in a RESTful manner.  Was this how\nothers were imagining that it might work?\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
