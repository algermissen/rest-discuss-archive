There&#39;s \n&gt; absolutely nothing with human readable resources--in fact they should \n&gt; be encouraged--but URI opaqueness is fundamental and very important \n&gt; to building flexible systems. The only thing a client should be doing \n&gt; to a URL is applying the basic verbs (GET,PUT,POST,etc) to it. It&#39;s \n&gt; just a locator. Machines aren&#39;t as smart as humans. \n&gt; \n\nI think you have to be clear about the context before talking about\nopaqueness. Are you &#39;constructing&#39; a URI or &#39;deconstructing&#39; a URI?\nIf you are deconstructing a URI, like Jon is doing in his ISBN app\nthen it is fragile and I agree that the URI should be handled\nopaquely.\n\nOn the other hand if you are constructing a URI I believe it is\nfine to do so. For example search engines do this all the time\nwhen they look for your &#39;robots.txt&#39; file. Your browser also does it\nwhen it looks for &#39;favicon.ico&#39;.\n\n\t-joe\n\n-- \nhttp://BitWorking.org\nhttp://WellFormedWeb.org\n\n\n\n"}}
