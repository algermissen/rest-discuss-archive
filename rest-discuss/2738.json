It isn&#39;t that\n&gt; different than launching SSL from HTTP.\n&gt; http://rfc.sunsite.dk/rfc/rfc2817.html\n&gt;\n&gt; Sorry for jumping in the middle. Wasted my email time today on TAG.\n&gt;\n\nI think there is a lot in there that is good - but I&#39;m not sure what HTTP\nmethod we&#39;d apply the Upgrade header to.\nIt is really a server operation, not a per-resource operation. I don&#39;t know\nthe SSL+HTTP stuff, so it might be a lot more similar that I&#39;m thinking.\n\nSo what are the choices?\na) Upgrade header\n - what method(s) or resources would this apply to? (probably OPTIONS...)\n - is it sufficiently like keep-alive that is applies to multiple requests?\n - am I worrying over nothing regarding Upgrade and multiple\nresources/methods?\n\nb) CONNECT method\n - how would this work?\n - CONNECT seems to be per-host rather than per-resource (you couldn&#39;t have\nmultiple resources, one per &#39;message queue&#39;- but this might simplify\nsecurity/authority issues)\n - what is CONNECT used for anyway? Is it for tunning a /different/ protocol\nover port 80 to a destination system?\n\nc) new method (TURN or something)\n\n\n\n"}}
