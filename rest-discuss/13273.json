Cannot a transaction manager itself\n&gt;&gt; &gt; have a RESTful interface? The application that is using the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; transaction\n&gt;&gt; &gt; manager will not be RESTful, but the interaction with the service\n&gt;&gt; &gt; will be.\n&gt;&gt; The transaction manager can have its own interface.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you.  And thats all I really wanted to hear.\n\nBut I did not say that is a good idea to build one. It would taste and  \nsmell the same as any other RPC/SOAP distributed transaction interface.\n\n&gt; But, this idea that everything has to be handcrafted isn&#39;t right  \n&gt; either.  The right solution is somewhere in the middle (hence  \n&gt; middleware). This is why I like REST better than the way CORBA and  \n&gt; WS-* has gone about describing things.  Concepts like HATEOAS change  \n&gt; the game a bit and makes things more flexible.\n\nThe right solution belongs somewhere behind servers but not between  \nclients and servers. HTTP isn&#39;t middleware. It is an application  \nprotocol.\n\nThe problem with the above approach as well as that of attempts like  \nRETRO is that they generalize (i.e. over-abstract) the problem space  \nand thereby leak implementation details (viz transactions or  \ncompensation) to clients. No matter whether the interface is uniform  \nor not, this is bad design for distributed applications. Clients  \n&quot;cancel orders&quot; but don&#39;t &quot;compensate for a business process&quot;.  If a  \nserver is forcing the clients to do the latter, it has dug itself into  \na hole.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSubbu\n\n"}}
