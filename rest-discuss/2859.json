Once we have bilateral \n&gt; agreements we&#39;ve departed from a common interface.\n\nOf course, but it&#39;s conceding only part of the point:  there will be \nbilateral agreements.  It doesn&#39;t detract from the value of the \ncommon interface.  The common parts make the bilateral agreements \nmuch simpler and easier.  \n\nFor example, there are now and will continue to emerge &quot;wannabe \nstandard&quot; business protocols for the order-to-cash cycle.\n\nI expect (as in Jeff Bone parallel argument) a small number of these \nwill be widely adopted and have identities (URIs and common names).  \n\nAt that point, the bilateral agreement can just say &quot;let&#39;s use \nhttp://www.PrepaidDropShipOrder.std with these modifications&quot;.\n\nAs opposed to the several months and many thousands of dollars it \ntakes now to negotiate bilateral EDI agreements...\n\n&gt; That said, I completely agree that where _partial_ global \nagreements are \n&gt; already in effect, then it would almost certainly help to factor \nthem \n&gt; out of any bilateral agreement ... eg. we agree on TCP/IP and HTTP, \n&gt; XML, maybe REST, so no need to negotiate over them).\n&gt; \n&gt; But that&#39;s a fixed, already sunk, cost. The problem is all the \nstuff \n&gt; that comes _afterwards_.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The more aspects that are standardized, the easier it is to \nnegotiate\n&gt; &gt; the operational interface between trading partners.\n&gt; \n&gt; The trouble is that the higher you climb up the semantic ladder the \n&gt; harder this stuff becomes.\n\nOf course.  Another aspect of agreement.\n\nAnd WalMart may continue to use the WalMart proprietary flavor of \neverything for a long time to come...\n\nNothing&#39;s perfect.\n\n-Bob Haugen\n\n\n"}}
