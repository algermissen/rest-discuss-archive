But that doesn’t\nmean it’s good design. You get only a minimum of the benefits of\nOOP, if any.\n\nLikewise, using HTTP in the way your fellow engineers are using\nit works, sure. But much of the value of HTTP is diminished. You\ncould be getting much more from it.\n\n&gt; * REST is just a hype, so why follow?\n\nREST has been around for two decades. REST is the sum of\npractices that have worked on the web.\n\nThe term “REST” is new and indeed hyped, but REST is old and\nproven.\n\nREST is here to stay. Fight it at your own peril.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nAristotle Pagaltzis // &lt;http://plasmasturm.org/&gt;\n\n"}}
