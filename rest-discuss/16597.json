And IANA\n&gt; doesn&#39;t maintain or assert any validity of these registrations.\n&gt; There&#39;s an example of an IANA registered text type that apparently\n&gt; have no surviving specifications. Both links associated with the media\n&gt; type are dead. So, even if something is up on IANA, it can well be an\n&gt; incomplete registration, and IANA doesn&#39;t seem to have any vetting or\n&gt; maintenance process to prevent that from happening.\n&gt; \n\nThat&#39;s why I&#39;m saying that registration of an identifier is only the\nminimal requirement for self-descriptiveness.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, &quot;the Web&quot; is often referred to, and tied to IANA. If &quot;the Web&quot;\n&gt; means standards that Web Browser creators use, and standard HTTP\n&gt; servers use when targeting Web Browser clients, then perhaps it is\n&gt; fair to consider IETF, via IANA, authoritative for that domain.\n&gt; \n\nYes, but the common case of the Web also includes a wide variety of\nintermediaries for widely varying purposes, as &quot;participants.&quot;  We do\nneed to agree on an authoritative registry.  Which can remain IANA, or\nwe can propose some other registry or registries in addition to IANA,\nbut on today&#39;s Web IANA is the only reality, and that definition of Web\nisn&#39;t remotely tied to browsers.  Googlebot is not a browser, and\nindexes things like PDFs which can&#39;t be natively displayed in a\nbrowser, but it&#39;s still the Web if it&#39;s HTTP over the Internet.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; But REST is not &quot;the Web&quot;, HTTP servers can (and do) serve clients\n&gt; other than web browsers. And other domains and industries will be\n&gt; leveraging HTTP servers, and REST(-like?) architectures, and they will\n&gt; be negotiating and standardizing their traffic through organizations\n&gt; and working groups other than IANA and IETF.\n&gt; \n\nREST may not be limited to the Web, but it still requires a network-\nbased API where all participants agree to a registration authority (or\nmultiple registration authorities) which explicitly defines what is\nself-descriptive and what isn&#39;t, instead of embedding shared\nunderstanding within code libraries (or tying it to the protocol spec\nversion), because that&#39;s the difference between having a uniform\ninterface or not having a uniform interface, as defined by REST.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; So, either the definition of REST needs to be clarified, or relaxed,\n&gt; on this point, or there needs to be some new term to describe these\n&gt; other systems.\n&gt; \n\nI would still need to see some sort of counter-example which shows my\nGopher-based explanation of the difference between library-based APIs\nand network-based APIs is wrong, or some other justification as to why\nregistries should be considered irrelevant to the style, before I can\nagree to relaxing REST&#39;s uniform interface constraint, i.e. falsify the \nreasoning behind self-descriptive messaging.\n\nIOW, I disagree that any new terminology is needed -- such systems are\nby definition library-based APIs, which are by definition not the same\nas uniform interface network-based APIs.  You can&#39;t define-down\n&quot;participant&quot; to mean only those systems coupled together by a shared\nunderstanding which resides in code libraries, and still call it REST,\nWeb or no Web.\n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
