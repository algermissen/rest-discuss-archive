So, SOAP and XML-RPC aren&#39;t using HTTP?\n&gt;\n&gt; It may be possible to use SOAP with HTTP --- Mark&#39;s got a better read on the current\n&gt; state of that effort (keeping SOAP from becoming unavoidably RPC-based) than I do.\n&gt; It&#39;s almost certainly *not* possible to use XML-RPC with HTTP without breaking HTTP.\n&gt; I.e., if you use e.g. XML-RPC, you aren&#39;t using HTTP, you&#39;re tunneling RPCs through\n&gt; HTTP.\n\nI don&#39;t see what the difference is between XML-RPC\nand Mike&#39;s solution to the terrorist-or-not.com\nproblem.  One encodes with MIME, the other with\nXML-RPC.\n\n&gt; &gt; blah blah blah.  I think most web apps (of\n&gt; &gt; which terrorist_or_not.coom is an example) are\n&gt; &gt; RPC.  The issue here is whether they are or\n&gt; &gt; aren&#39;t.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t have any issue here.  I think you&#39;re probably right --- most probably are.\n&gt; But that doesn&#39;t really say anything except that most developers don&#39;t really\n&gt; understand HTTP, and it&#39;s easier for them to superimpose their own procedural or OO\n&gt; view of the world on top of HTTP.\n\nYou were making an argument about existence\nproofs.  My point is that existence goes both\nways.\n\n&gt; &gt; I just fail to see why that is REST.\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s REST because it&#39;s HTTP.  That&#39;s what POST *is for,* per the HTTP spec.\n\nXML-RPC uses POST too.  But you deny that it is\nREST!\n\n-Alex-\n___________________________________________________________________\nS.
