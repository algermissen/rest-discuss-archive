REST\n&gt; should be able to do better, but the standards will need to be worked\n&gt; out.\n&gt; \n&gt; So are standardized media types and relations sufficient?\n&gt; \n\nYes!  Absolutely.  Here&#39;s how the future will likely unfold:  There\nexists today a wide variety of shopping-cart implementations online.\nThey each employ wildly divergent markup to handle the same types of\ndata.  A standardization effort will arise in the accessibility\ncommunity, to create a metalanguage using existing tools like RDFa,\n@role and WAI-ARIA to express standard e-commerce transaction\nsemantics in a fashion which works across multiple host languages.\n\nThus, standard media types are made semantically rich by the addition\nof standardized attribute sets, which may be added to existing shopping-\ncart markup instead of going back to the drawing board, for the primary\npurpose of accessibility -- which is all about improving human-readable\ninterfaces to also be device-accessible, aka machine-readable.  This\nmachine-readable metadata provides the basis for M2M transactions by\ncoding to the self-documenting API provided by the human-readable\nmarkup.\n\n(I was on about this in another thread.  While a standardized Cloud API\nwould need a new media type, I would create it by borrowing heavily\nfrom XHTML for the purpose of making the interface accessible using\nstandard techniques like WAI-ARIA and @role, with RDFa to express\nsemantics preferred over the creation of new elements.  Even the blind\nought to be able to manipulate their servers over the Web, so creating\na new media type must not result in breaking the interface between\nbrowser accessibility and the accessibility API of the host OS, by\npreventing the use of standard accessibility techniques.  This is\nturning into a boilerplate argument for me, in support of my rule of\nthumb for creating new media types:  Don&#39;t!)\n\nThe problem with creating a new media type(s) for this problem area, is\nthat it enforces a new and unfamiliar set of elements and attributes to\nbe used, which won&#39;t be embeddable in existing host languages (it can&#39;t\nreplace your existing shopping-cart markup), and therefore is limited to\nM2M transactions, forcing the development and maintenance of separate\nhuman and machine APIs for a system.  This is duplication of effort,\nwhen proper maintenance of HTML shopping-cart code is work enough\nalready.  Standardize metadata attributes rather than creating new\nmarkup languages.\n\nWhat&#39;s particularly absurd, is the notion of creating a new media type\nfor each application state progressed through.  Ugh!  I&#39;ll keep saying\nit:  In REST, we transfer representations of application state, with\nthe server instructing the client how to behave.  The client does not\nsend instructions to the server on how it should behave.  Media types\nare not meant as tokens by which a client can direct server behavior. \n\n-Eric\n\n"}}
