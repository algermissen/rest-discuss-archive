Any insight\n&gt; &gt; here would be most helpful.\n&gt;\n&gt; I haven&#39;t found a reason to use PUT rather than POST\n&gt; for creating a new resource. I&#39;m still waiting for\n&gt; the killer example where it makes sense.\nWhen using PUT, the client is in control of the URI space. So take any PUT\nenabled file-system based Web server (like Apache) and it becomes a &#39;dumb\nserver&#39;, and the smarts can move into the client application - intelligence\nat the edge. Example apps could be shared music playlists (requires music\nplayers like iTunes, musicmatch, winamp to be more than brain dead\nembarassments to the software development community - support caching of\nhttp resources rather than re-fetching, support &#39;save to the web&#39; for\nplaylists, etc..)\nOther examples may come out of the rich client work popping up in\napplications like GMail.\n\n&gt; Using PUT to create a resource is like using UPDATE\n&gt; in SQL to create a new row.\nUsing PUT is more like using UPSERT. Also, new rows are created via the\nINSERT statement, UPDATE doesn&#39;t create new rows (although I&#39;m only speaking\nfrom limited experience in the world of SQL). The UPSERT operation is only\nsupported in a few SQL systeems, I&#39;m pretty sure MySQL supports it (but the\ntable needs to have a uniqueness constraint on the primary key).\n\n\n"}}
