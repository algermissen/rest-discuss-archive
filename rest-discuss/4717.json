[...]\n&gt; \n&gt; Indeed, I&#39;ll note that there is nothing in the HTTP spec which\n&gt; prohibits returning a body in the response to a DELETE request. So,\n&gt; although somewhat unorthodox wrt how one usually considers DELETE, it\n&gt; would seem tht returning the head of the queue in the DELETE response\n&gt; would address this issue rather elegantly.\n\nSince GET and DELETE are both idempotent, there is not need to come\nup with any other mechanism for atomicity.  GET and DELETE can be\ncalled repeatedly in the face of a communications failure, so given\nthe restrictions in my particular circumstance - single consumer or\nqueue, guaranteed delivery, ability to re-establish context, no \nsupport of POST or PUT - the semantics of GET and DELETE support \nwhat is necessary.\n\nThis is somewhat off topic, but I found this dicussion on idempotency\nto be illuminating:\n\nhttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg-old/1997MayAug/0704.html \n \n&gt; &gt; The ideal solution would be one method. Somethng like &quot;TAKE&quot;,\n&gt; &gt; i.e. &quot;IN&quot; using Linda terms.\n&gt; \n&gt; Agreed. It has been noted on this list before that there aree some\n&gt; similarities between Linda tuplespaces (or blackboard systems) and\n&gt; REST. I would argue that the HTTP protocol stack (including the\n&gt; extended methods deeinfed by the WebDAV working group) /is/ a\n&gt; coordination language...\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; [...] Maybe WebDAV should be used. [...]\n&gt; \n&gt; This would be most appropriate, especially if the above approach using\n&gt; DELETE is not acceptable for some reason. Using a sequence of LOCK &gt;\n&gt; GET &gt; DELETE would provide the desired atomic behavior that is needed.\n&gt; in this situation.\n\nIf there were a need to support multiple consumers, I would agree.\n\n"}}
