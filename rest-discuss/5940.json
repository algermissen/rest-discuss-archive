The response to the POST is =\r\ninstead a redirect to a temporary\n&gt; URL containing the response page.  The =\r\nbrowser then GETs this response\n&gt; page and displays it.  Due to the redirec=\r\nt, the original POST request is\n&gt; replaced by this GET request in the brows=\r\ner history.  Thus, the user can\n&gt; use the back button with impunity, and wi=\r\nll just see the result of their\n&gt; request, with no danger of resubmitting i=\r\nt.\n&gt;\n&gt; That sounds great, but it seems to clash with REST.  What was before=\r\n a\n&gt; transitory response to a POST request now becomes a separate resource\n=\r\n&gt; available via GET.  Will it be cached?  How long must it stay available?\n=\r\n\nAside from interesting discussion on POE (more on that later), I don&#39;t\nsee=\r\n how redirect after post clashes with REST.\n\nSince you&#39;re using HTML forms,=\r\n you are dealing with two\nrepresentations of a resource: text/html and\nappl=\r\nication/x-www-form-urlencoded. And, you&#39;re dealing with another\nresource --=\r\n the form, which effectively provides the schema for\napplication/x-www-form=\r\n-urlencoded represntation. For instance:\n\nhtml representation of resource: =\r\n/resources/resource.html\nurlencoded representation of resource: /resources/=\r\nresource.urlencoded\nhtml representation of the form: /forms/resource-schema=\r\n.html\n\nIn this case, action of the form should point to /resource.urlencode=\r\nd,\nbecause that&#39;s the representation of the resource that the form is\ndeali=\r\nng with. However, knowing that user agents are not very\ninterested reading =\r\nurlencoded data, I don&#39;t see anything wrong with it\nalways responding with =\r\n302 Found (even for a GET) that points to\n/resource.html after processing t=\r\nhe request.\n\nSo, anytime you POST or GET to /resource.urlencoded, you alway=\r\ns get\nredirected to /resource.html. It becomes the hidden or less preferred=\r\n\nrepresentation.\n\nOr am I missing something?\n\n:DG&lt;\n\n"}}
