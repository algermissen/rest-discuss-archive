My question is what&#39;s appropriate/acceptable to\nput there? Coul=\r\nd it be just a URI template and then the client would\nuse that template to =\r\ngo directly to the resources it&#39;s looking for? \n\nHere&#39;s what my current sit=\r\nuation is. My client application application\nmanipulates &quot;content records&quot; =\r\nthat it identifies by a URN that takes\nthe form of: &quot;mgid:[foo]:[bar]:[baz]=\r\n:[id]&quot;. To the client, this isn&#39;t\njust an opaque string. It understands the=\r\n concept of foos, bars, etc.\nand can extract them from the URN. (FWIW, thes=\r\ne are design decisions\nthat were made long ago and I have no control over.)=\r\n Would it be\nappropriate for me to put something like this as the starting =\r\npoint\nfor all clients?\n\nhttp://service.mysite.com/v{version}/mgid/{foo}/{ba=\r\nr}/{baz}/{id}\n\n\nThen whenever the client accesses the service, it does a GE=\r\nT on\nhttp://service.mysite.com/ , parses the URI template, and carries on.\n=\r\n\n\nDoes that sound reasonable? I gotten suggestions from some people (who\ndo=\r\nn&#39;t know REST well at all) to POST the URN and respond with the\ncorrect URI=\r\n or redirect to it. This, I&#39;m pretty sure, is a really bad\nidea.\n\nCheers,\nM=\r\nichael\n\n\n"}}
