Alexander Jacobson&quot; &lt;alex@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t know enough about MIME politics to know\n&gt; the correct answer to whether you proliferate MIME\n&gt; types (per se) or simply add a version parameter.\n&gt;\n&gt; My point is simply that MIME provides the OBVIOUS\n&gt; and traditional mechanism for solving this\n&gt; problem.\n&gt;\n&gt; Better to fix MIME implementations, than to create\n&gt; an entirely new mechanism for content-type.\n\nI agree.  To that end:\n\nI propose the addition of a new MIME subtype to each of the 8 existing\nmedia-types.  The name of the subtype will be &quot;type-uri&quot;.  The type will\nhave a single required parameter &quot;uri&quot;, whose value is a URI.  The complete\nmedia type (including URI) will identify a specification.\n\nThe following limitations are placed on the URI (yes, Joe.  I know I&#39;m\nwading into those murky waters.  &lt;g&gt;) :\n\n1) Creation rules of a new URI *must* be according to the scheme used.\n\n2) The URI *must* be compared at the octet level.  As a result, creators of\nnew URIs should be very careful about the characters they use to ensure\nmaximum compatibility (e.g. do not use characters that may need escaping in\nsome instances).  This also means that URIs are case-sensitive.  I realize\nthat some schemes are case-insensitive, but require a case-sensitive version\nof the URI to be used will not break those schemes.\n\n3) If the scheme used has any form of dereferencing, then the URI *must* be\ndereferencable and *should* dereference to details about the associated\nspecification.  Since it is not possible to guarantee that a URI will be\ndereferencable at all times (e.g. network or server outages), recognition of\nthe MIME type *must* not rely on the ability to derefence the URI.  For this\npurpose, the URI must be recognized as nothing more than an octet string.\n\n4) It is strongly recommended that a dereferencable URI point to an entity\ndescribing (or otherwise directing the user to) the associated\nspecification.\n\n\nThat&#39;s it really.  I&#39;m sure there are all sorts of unanswered... umm...\nquestions.  So let&#39;s here them.  If you have a better suggestion for the\nsubtype name, let&#39;s here that too.  :)\n\n---\nSeairth Jacobs\nseairth@...\n\n\n"}}
