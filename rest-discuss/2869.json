You\n&gt; only need O(NlogN) edges in a random graph to get complete\n&gt; connectivity, so O(NlogN) seems like a good guess for the typical, as\n&gt; opposed to the worst, case. FWIW ... not proof, but I&#39;ve seen data from\n&gt; a major (ie. one that hasn&#39;t gone bust yet ;-) B2B exchange which\n&gt; supports this.\n\nI would agree that O(N log N) is a sound estimate in this case...\n\n&gt; For multiple interfaces that&#39;d give us,\n&gt;\n&gt;   O(NlogN)     cost of integration (ie. NlogN implemented interfaces)\n&gt;   O(NlogN)     cost of agreement   (ie.

In fact, in the open-world of the Web, the \nproducer usually cannot even know a priori more than a very small \nsubset of consumers, much less seek consensus among them.\n\nSo N in the integration case is the number of interfaces, while in the \nagreement case there&#39;s really a different quantity involved --- M, the \nnumber of parties to the agreement a priori.  And M is guaranteed to be \na miniscule value relative to N.  M != N!  Perhaps the notation should \nreflect this;  better to say something like:\n\nClosed world assumption, full participation of parties to agreement, \ntype-specific interfaces:\n\nO(N log N) integration cost (N = number of implemented interfaces)\nO(N * M log M) consensus cost (M = number of bilateral agreements == \ntotal number of participants)\n\nOpen world assumption, many non-agreeing consumers, generic interfaces:\n\nO(N) integration cost\nO(N * Q log Q) consensus cost (Q = producers / consumers party to \nagreement, Q &lt;&lt; M)\n\n\njb\n\n\n"}}
