In principal I \n&gt;&gt; get the theoretical difference, but I think the examples you give \n&gt;&gt; don&#39;t necessarily illustrate the point, and in one case confuses me.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m also struggling with the difference between application state and \n&gt; server state (which I assume is the same as &quot;resource state&quot;). Can \n&gt; someone point me to a good definition of &quot;application state&quot;?\n&gt; \n&gt; Will some kinds of state never stop being &quot;application state&quot;, no matter \n&gt; how or where it&#39;s stored? If I were to move for instance typical session \n&gt; state into it&#39;s own resources, and treat those resources as any regular \n&gt; resource in my application - will those resources for some definitions \n&gt; of state still be application state (and a violation of the stateless \n&gt; constraint)? Or does the fact that I&#39;ve re-modelled it as resources make \n&gt; it resource state?\n&gt; \n\nYeah, somebody will have to explain to me why (or if) the Reservation \nexample I gave breaks the stateless constraint of REST.  Where I think \nit doesn&#39;t break the constraint is that instead of storing a specific \n&quot;view&quot; of a resource for a specific client (like the Richardson/Ruby \nO&#39;Reilly book example on transactions), the state change is modeled as a \nresource in and of itself.  A Reservation still has a lot of meaning to \nclients other than the Travel Agent.\n\nAlso, whether or not the Reservation has been fulfilled is a valid state \nof the resource.  Just because I chose to model that state with a \nspecific media type (a generic transactional one) shouldn&#39;t matter IMO \nas its an implementation detail.\n\n\n-- \nBill Burke\nJBoss, a division of Red Hat\nhttp://bill.burkecentral.com\n\n"}}
